A substantial percentage of heterosexual syphilis transmission occurs among persons who use illicit drugs, particularly methamphetamine. Diagnosis of another STI may signal that a person is having condomless sex, which increases their risk of syphilis infection. Higher infection rates in persons of some racial and ethnic groups have been reported and are primarily a reflection of a combination of factors, including social determinants of health (eg, disparities of income, low educational achievement, and unstable housing), differential health insurance coverage or access to quality health care, and differences in sexual network characteristics (eg, individuals living in communities with a high prevalence of STIs have an increased chance of encountering an infected partner).

Adverse childhood experiences influence the likelihood of experiencing mental health conditions such as anxiety. Adverse childhood experiences may result from a complex interaction of familial, peer, or societal factors, including racial discrimination. These adverse childhood experiences may be blatant or subtle (eg, microaggressions) but are potentially traumatic events that, in the context of historic trauma, structural racism, and biopsychological vulnerability, can worsen mental health outcomes. Combined with lower engagement with mental health services, adverse childhood experiences can result in high levels of unmet mental health needs in Black youth. Similar patterns of historic trauma, adverse childhood experiences, and substance abuse may also explain higher rates of mental health disorders in Native American/Alaska Native youth.</span></p>","general":"937","tool":["552","413","407","406","405","404","554","553"]},{"id":1938,"title":"Aspirin Use to Prevent Preeclampsia and Related Morbidity and Mortality: Preventive Medication -- Pregnant persons at high risk for preeclampsia","grade":"B","gradeVer":1,"gender":"female","sex":"female","ageRange":[11,49],"text":"The USPSTF recommends the use of low-dose aspirin (81 mg/day) as preventive medication after 12 weeks of gestation in persons who are at high risk for preeclampsia.\r<br>\r<br>See the Practice Considerations section for information on high risk and aspirin dose.","servFreq":"<p><span style=\"line-height: 107%; font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;\">Once daily after 12 weeks of gestation</span></p>","riskName":"Pregnant","risk":["39"],"riskText":"<p><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman;\"> </span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0in; ; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman;\">Persons with a history of preeclampsia in a previous pregnancy, type 1 or type 2 diabetes, and chronic hypertension are at highest risk for preeclampsia.

It is important to note that increasing age heavily influences the ACC/AHA estimated 10-year CVD event risk. The risk prediction equations generally show higher risk for Black persons than White persons. The USPSTF recognizes that race is a social construct and an imperfect proxy for social determinants of health and the effects of structural racism. Concerns about calibration exist, with many external validation studies showing overprediction in broad populations (men and women across racial and ethnic groups). Limited evidence also suggests underprediction in disadvantaged communities&nbsp;that could lead to underutilization of preventive therapies. Clinicians should recognize that predictions of 10-year CVD events using the Pooled Cohort Equations are estimates.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman;\"> </span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; text-align: left; ; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\" align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 11pt;\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman;\"> </span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; text-align: left; ; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\" align=\"left\"><em><span style=\"font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 11pt; font-weight: normal; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;\">Bleeding Risk</span></em></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman;\"> </span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0in; ; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman;\">The risk for gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, and hemorrhagic stroke, with or without aspirin use, increases with older age.

The effect of multifactorial risk assessment and screening for risk factors on oral cancer morbidity and mortality is unknown.","general":"345","tool":["109","23"]},{"id":2026,"title":"Oral Health in Adults: Screening and Preventive Interventions -- Asymptomatic adults 18 years or older","grade":"I","gradeVer":1,"gender":"men and women","sex":"men and women","ageRange":[18,100],"text":"The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of routine screening performed by primary care clinicians for oral health conditions, including dental caries or periodontal-related disease, in adults.","riskName":"","risk":[],"general":"757","tool":["475","483","482","481","480","479","378","477","476"]},{"id":2027,"title":"Oral Health in Adults: Screening and Preventive Interventions -- Asymptomatic adults 18 years or older","grade":"I","gradeVer":1,"gender":"men and women","sex":"men and women","ageRange":[18,100],"text":"The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of preventive interventions performed by primary care clinicians for oral health conditions, including dental caries or periodontal-related disease, in adults.","riskName":"","risk":[],"general":"757","tool":["475","483","482","481","480","479","378","477","476"]},{"id":2024,"title":"Oral Health in Children and Adolescents Aged 5 to 17 Years: Screening and Preventive Interventions -- Asymptomatic children and adolescents aged 5 to 17 years","grade":"I","gradeVer":1,"gender":"men and women","sex":"men and women","ageRange":[5,17],"text":"The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of routine screening performed by primary care clinicians for oral health conditions, including dental caries, in children and adolescents aged 5 to 17 years.","riskName":"","risk":[],"general":"1459","tool":["475","483","482","481","480","479","379","378","477","476"]},{"id":2025,"title":"Oral Health in Children and Adolescents Aged 5 to 17 Years: Screening and Preventive Interventions -- Asymptomatic children and adolescents aged 5 to 17 years","grade":"I","gradeVer":1,"gender":"men and women","sex":"men and women","ageRange":[5,17],"text":"The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of preventive interventions performed by primary care clinicians for oral health conditions, including dental caries, in children and adolescents aged 5 to 17 years.","riskName":"","risk":[],"general":"1459","tool":["475","483","482","481","480","479","379","378","477","476"]},{"id":2059,"title":"Osteoporosis to Prevent Fractures: Screening -- Men","grade":"I","gradeVer":1,"gender":"male","sex":"male","ageRange":[40,100],"text":"The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for osteoporosis to prevent osteoporotic fractures in men.\r<br>\r<br>See the \"Practice Considerations\" section for suggestions for practice regarding the I statement.","riskName":"","risk":[],"riskText":"<p class=\"Para\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0in; text-indent: 0in; line-height: normal; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt;\">Men have similar risk factors associated with fragility fractures as women, including increasing age, low BMI, excessive alcohol intake, current smoking, chronic corticosteroid use, history of prior fractures, history of falls within the past year, hypogonadism, history of cerebrovascular accident, and history of diabetes.</span></p>","general":"799","tool":["514","518","517","516","515"]},{"id":424,"title":"Peripheral Artery Disease and Cardiovascular Disease: Screening and Risk Assessment With the Ankle-Brachial Index -- Adults","grade":"I","gradeVer":1,"gender":"men and women","sex":"men and women","ageRange":[18,100],"text":"The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for peripheral artery disease (PAD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk with the ankle-brachial index (ABI) in asymptomatic adults.\r<br>\r<br>Literature scans conducted in August 2023 in the MEDLINE database and the Cochrane Library showed a lack of new evidence to support an updated systematic review on the topic at this time.

In 2010, the prevalence of ASD in the United States was estimated at 14.7 cases per 1000 children, or 1 in 68 children, with substantial variability in estimates by region, sex, and race/ethnicity.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Detection</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that currently available screening tests can detect ASD among children aged 18 to 30 months.</p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Intervention or Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found inadequate direct evidence on the benefits of screening for ASD in toddlers and preschool-age children for whom no concerns of ASD have been raised by family members, other caregivers, or health care professionals. There are no studies that focus on the clinical outcomes of children identified with ASD through screening. Although there are studies suggesting treatment benefit in older children identified through family, clinician, or teacher concerns, the USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the efficacy of treatment of cases of ASD detected through screening or among very young children. Treatment studies were generally very small, few were randomized trials, most included children who were older than would be identified through screening, and all were in clinically referred rather than screen-detected patients.</p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Early Detection and Intervention or Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found that the harms of screening for ASD and subsequent interventions are likely to be small based on evidence about the prevalence, accuracy of screening, and likelihood of minimal harms from behavioral interventions.</p>\r\n<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes that there is insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for ASD in children aged 18 to 30 months for whom no concerns of ASD have been raised. Evidence is lacking, of poor quality, or conflicting, and the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined.</p>","clinical":"<h2>Clinical Considerations</h2><h3><a id=\"consider\" name=\"consider\"></a>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>\r\n<p>This recommendation applies to children who have not been diagnosed with ASD or developmental delay and for whom no concerns of ASD have been raised by parents, other caregivers, or health care professionals.</p>\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>A number of tests are available for screening for ASD in children younger than 30 months. The most commonly studied tool is the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT) and its subsequent revisions (Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers With Follow-Up [M-CHAT-F] and Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers&ndash;Revised, With Follow-Up [M-CHAT-R/F]). The M-CHAT-R/F is a parent-rated scale, and a positive finding leads to a follow-up interview. If the follow-up interview is positive, a full diagnostic workup for ASD is indicated. The screening process assesses communication skills, joint attention, repetitive movement, and pretend play.</p>\r\n<h3>Treatments and Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>Treatments for ASD include behavioral, medical, educational, speech/language, and occupational therapy and complementary and alternative medicine approaches. Treatments for young children in the target age group for routine screening for ASD are primarily behavioral interventions, particularly early intensive behavioral and developmental interventions, which may include approaches incorporating applied behavior analysis principles, parent training components, and play- or interaction-based interventions. Among the behavioral interventions, those based on applied behavior analysis have the highest-quality data supporting their effects on cognitive and language outcomes. These interventions can be delivered in a home or school setting and are generally time-intensive, with some programs requiring up to 40 hours a week.<sup>2</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>\r\n<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>\r\n<p>Autism spectrum disorder can cause significant social, communication, and behavioral challenges for affected children and place substantial strain on family members and other caregivers. Treatment and maturation may reduce the effects of the core symptoms of ASD for some children, but others may experience long-term effects on education, employment, and ability to live independently.<sup>2</sup> It is important that clinicians listen carefully to parents when concerns are raised by the parents or during an examination and make prompt use of validated tools to assess the need for further diagnostic testing and services. Disparities have been observed in the frequency and age at which ASD is diagnosed among children by race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and language of origin, creating concern that certain groups of children with ASD may be systematically underdiagnosed.<sup>3</sup> It is important to note that an \"I\" statement is not a recommendation for or against screening. In the absence of evidence about the balance of benefits and harms, clinicians should use their clinical judgment to decide if screening in children without overt signs and symptoms is appropriate for the population in their care.</p>\r\n<h4>Potential Harms</h4>\r\n<p>Although there is limited evidence about the harms of screening for ASD in children, reported potential harms include misdiagnosis and the anxiety associated with further testing after a positive screening result, particularly if confirmatory testing is delayed because of resource limitations. Behavioral treatments are not generally thought to be associated with significant harms but can place a large time and financial burden on the family. Other treatments for ASD are less well studied and were not included in this review.</p>\r\n<h4>Current Practice</h4>\r\n<p>A 2004 survey of pediatricians in Maryland and Delaware found that 8% screened specifically for ASD. Few data are available regarding the current prevalence of screening for ASD by clinicians in the United States.<sup>4</sup> More recent surveys have found higher rates, although they remain less than 60%.<sup>5-8</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Useful Resources</h4>\r\n<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides web-based continuing education for clinicians called Autism Case Training (available at <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/actearly/autism/case-modules/index.html\">https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/actearly/autism/case-modules/index.html</a>), as well as other information about ASD for families (available at <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/families.html\">https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/families.html</a>).</p>\r\n<p>The Health Resources and Services Administration&rsquo;s web site provides links to training resources for professionals (available at <a href=\"https://mchb.hrsa.gov/maternal-child-health-initiatives/autism\">https://mchb.hrsa.gov/maternal-child-health-initiatives/autism</a>).</p>\r\n<p>The M-CHAT screening tool is available online for free at <a href=\"https://m-chat.org\">https://m-chat.org</a>. Other professional and advocacy organizations have also developed toolkits and resources.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF has made a recommendation on screening for speech and language delays and disorders among children 5 years or younger (available at <a  href=\"https://uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/\">https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>).</p><h2>Other Considerations</h2><h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\n<p>Research has focused on screening and diagnostic tools and treatment for symptomatic children, especially those who are severely affected. Good-quality studies are needed to better understand the intermediate and long-term health outcomes of screening for ASD among children without obvious signs and symptoms and whether earlier identification through universal screening is associated with clinically important improvements in health outcomes. These studies are especially needed in populations with low socioeconomic status and minority populations, where access to care may be more limited. A number of different study designs could greatly improve the understanding of the potential of screening. Large, good-quality, randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of treatment that enroll young children with ASD identified through screening and that report patient-centered outcomes are critical to understanding the effects of screening. Treatment could be compared with a wait-list control, less intense treatment, or an alternative treatment, as in the trials reviewed by the USPSTF. Similar studies in children identified through screening have recently begun to be published, indicating that this is a feasible approach.<sup>9, 10</sup> Pragmatic quasi-experimental designs, such as stepped-wedge trials, in regions with low screening rates could compare the effects of screening at 18 and 24 months with later screening or case-finding on educational, behavioral, functional, and IQ measures at 6 years. Randomized clinical trials of screening may be feasible in locations where screening is not standard practice or recommended. Studies following up large samples of screen-negative children, although resource-intensive, would provide valuable information regarding screening specificity.</p>","other":"<h2>Recommendations of Others</h2><p>The American Academy of Pediatrics&rsquo; Bright Futures guidelines recommend universal screening for ASD in all children at ages 18 and 24 months in addition to developmental surveillance and monitoring.<sup>17, 18</sup> The American Academy of Family Physicians concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for ASD in children for whom no concerns of ASD have been raised by their parents or clinical provider.<sup>19</sup> The American Academy of Neurology and the Child Neurology Society recommend routine developmental surveillance be performed on all children to identify those at risk for any type of atypical development, followed by screening specifically for autism using one of the validated instruments (the M-CHAT or Autism Screening Questionnaire).<sup>20</sup> The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry recommends that the developmental assessment of young children and the psychiatric assessment of all children should routinely include questions about ASD symptomatology.<sup>21</sup> The UK National Screening Committee does not recommend systematic population screening, citing concerns about the stability of ASD diagnosis at a young age, lack of data on positive predictive value, and weakness of the evidence for the efficacy of treatment.<sup>22</sup></p>","discussion":"<h2>Discussion</h2><h3>Burden of Disease</h3>\r\n<p>Autism spectrum disorder is a developmental disorder characterized by persistent and significant impairments in social interaction and communication and restrictive and repetitive behaviors and activities, when these symptoms cannot be accounted for by another condition. In 2010, the prevalence of ASD in the United States was estimated at 14.7 cases per 1000 children, or 1 in 68 children, with substantial variability in estimates by region, sex, and race/ethnicity.<sup>1</sup> This represents a 23% increase from 2008; the reasons for this increase are not completely understood.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF commissioned a systematic review<sup>2</sup> to evaluate the evidence on the accuracy, benefits, and potential harms of brief, formal screening instruments for ASD administered during routine primary care visits, and the benefits and potential harms of early behavioral treatment for children identified with ASD through screening. The review focused on studies of screening in children younger than 3 years who were unselected (ie, not identified because of risk factors or concerns regarding ASD).</p>\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>Several screening tools for ASD are available, but the strongest and most applicable evidence is for the M-CHAT/F and M-CHAT-R/F, 2 versions of the same tool. Both use a parent-rated scale that can lead to a follow-up interview, which, if positive, leads to referral for confirmatory diagnosis by a behavioral or developmental specialist. The initial screening process takes 5 to 10 minutes. Two large, good-quality trials conducted in the United States in children aged 16 to 30 months found similar positive predictive values for these tools (approximately 50%) for the detection of ASD in unselected populations.<sup>11, 12</sup> The validity of these studies was weakened somewhat by the high dropout rate between screening steps but is still reasonably high for mass screening. There are no data on the specificity or negative predictive value of these screening tools. One study followed up a sample of children who were referred for diagnostic evaluation as a result of screening but not diagnosed with ASD and reported that almost all of these children had another form of developmental delay.<sup>12</sup> It is not known whether early detection of these other problems results in improved health outcomes. Although a number of potential risk factors for ASD have been identified, there is insufficient evidence to determine if certain risk factors modify the performance characteristics of ASD screening tests, such as the age at which screening is performed or other characteristics of the child or family.</p>\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no RCTs that directly addressed the overarching question of whether screening for ASD in children 3 years or younger results in improvements to core ASD symptoms, cognitive and intellectual functioning, language and communication skill development, challenging behavior, adaptive behavior, educational placement or achievement, or quality of life for the child and family.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found 26 RCTs of early intensive behavioral and developmental interventions (the most often studied treatment for this age group) for ASD in young children. However, assessment of treatment evidence was complicated by the variation among studies in intervention design, method of delivery, comparators, and outcomes measured, as well as by the heterogeneity in the age, types of symptoms, and symptom severity of the children enrolled. Four RCTs reported cognitive and language outcomes for early intensive behavioral interventions delivered by trained clinicians. Three of the 4 trials (including the largest trial, with 294 children) reported that these interventions improved cognitive scores by 11 to 16 points (Mullen Scales of Early Learning or IQ) compared with a range of comparators (calculated from published data).<sup>13-15</sup> The fourth RCT found no effect, but this trial compared different ways of delivering the same intervention.<sup>16</sup> The same set of studies showed a similar pattern for language outcomes. Twelve RCTs of play- or interaction-based interventions reported significant improvements in some measures of interaction but not others. The other RCTs evaluated various interventions delivered by parents and found inconsistent or negative results. Studies were very small (most enrolled 20&ndash;40 children), and study quality was generally fair.</p>\r\n<p>In addition to the limitations of the evidence in size, study design, and other sources of heterogeneity, it is not clear whether these studies are applicable to children who would be detected through screening. Autism spectrum disorder is a highly heterogeneous condition in terms of onset and course of core clinical ASD symptoms and cognitive and language development.<sup>17</sup> All of the treatment studies were conducted in populations of children with a previous diagnosis of ASD, many of whom were referred from specialized ASD programs. Many of the children enrolled in these studies had significant impairments in cognition, language, and behavior identified through case-finding and were older than the age group for which the screening tools were developed. Children identified through screening rather than through case-finding are likely to be younger and have milder symptoms than those in study populations. It is therefore not clear whether young children with ASD detected by screening and not because of parental or clinician concern will experience similar benefits from earlier intervention.</p>\r\n<h3>Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found little evidence on the harms of screening and treatment. Potential harms include misdiagnosis and the time, effort, and anxiety associated with further testing after a positive screening result. This is of particular concern when there is a delay in confirmatory testing because of resource limitations, which are common.<sup>2</sup> Even good-quality studies of screening had a high dropout rate between screening steps and between screening and diagnosis, suggesting that the process may be difficult for some families. Behavioral treatments are not generally thought to be associated with significant harms but can place a large time and financial burden on the family. Other treatments for ASD are less well studied and were not included in the scope of this review. The USPSTF concludes that the potential harms of screening and behavioral treatment are no greater than small.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</strong></h3>\r\n<p>Overall, the USPSTF found insufficient evidence on screening for ASD in children aged 18 to 30 months for whom no concerns of ASD have been raised by parents, other caregivers, or health care professionals. The USPSTF identified no studies that directly evaluated the benefits or harms of screening for ASD in this age group. Studies on the benefits and harms of treatment were of small size, few were randomized, and all were conducted in populations that may not represent children who would be detected through screening programs alone. The USPSTF concludes that there is insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for ASD in young children.</p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from August 4, 2015, to August 31, 2015. Many parents of children with ASD, adults with ASD, and clinicians who care for children with ASD wrote to share their personal experiences and concerns. One major area of concern was a perception that the USPSTF was advocating against screening or against the use of screening tools to follow up on parents&rsquo; concerns. This was not the USPSTF&rsquo;s intention, and the USPSTF will be clear when communicating this recommendation that it is not recommending for or against screening but advocating for more research. In the meantime, clinicians should use their clinical judgment, especially when caring for populations in which case-finding may be difficult because of language, access, or other barriers. Furthermore, clinicians should listen carefully to parents&rsquo; concerns and use validated tools to assess whether further diagnosis or services are needed. Standardized tools, such as the M-CHAT, may be used diagnostically to follow up on concerns expressed by parents.</p>\r\n<p>Another area of concern was why studies of test accuracy and the effectiveness of treatment were not sufficient to support screening and what kind of research would be needed to support a positive recommendation. In response, the USPSTF revised the recommendation statement to clarify the lack of treatment studies in the population that would likely be identified through screening and to provide greater detail about the different types of studies that could fill this evidentiary gap. Finally, other comments focused on the low cost and lack of harms associated with screening. The USPSTF revised the recommendation statement to clarify that, while the screening tools are relatively easy to administer and behavioral interventions are generally safe, the potential effects of extended treatment, in the absence of clear benefit, on families in terms of time and resources are not negligible.</p>","topic":"Autism Spectrum Disorder in Young Children: Screening","keywords":"Autism|Developmental Delay|Spectrum","pubDate":"2016-02-16","categories":["1"],"tool":["26","30","29","28","27"]},"256":{"topicType":"Screening","topicYear":2004,"uspstfAlias":"rh-d-incompatibility-screening","specific":[186,187],"title":"Rh(D) Incompatibility: Screening","rationale":"<h2>Rationale</h2><p><strong>Specific Recommendation:&nbsp;</strong>The USPSTF strongly recommends Rh(D) blood typing and antibody testing for all pregnant women during their first visit for pregnancy-related care.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Rationale: </strong>The USPSTF found good evidence that Rh(D) blood typing, anti-Rh(D) antibody testing, and intervention with Rh(D) immunoglobulin, as appropriate, prevents maternal sensitization and improves outcomes for newborns.

It is the seventh-leading cause of solid cancer-related deaths. An estimated 70,980 new cases of bladder cancer were diagnosed in the United States during 2009 (52,810 cases in men and 18,170 cases in women), and approximately 14,330 people died of the disease (10,180 men and 4150 women). More than 90% of all cases of bladder cancer are classified as transitional cell carcinomas. Most newly diagnosed transitional cell carcinomas present as superficial tumors. The stages of bladder cancer include superficial (Ta or T1) and muscle-invasive tumors. Many superficial tumors (50% to 70%) will recur after treatment, with a 10% to 20% risk for the tumor to progress to the invasive stage. One fourth of all cases of bladder cancer and 20% to 40% of all invasive tumors have already metastasized to the lymph nodes at the time of diagnosis. Invasive bladder cancer is associated with a poor prognosis.</p>\r\n<h3>Detection</h3>\r\n<p>The evidence is inadequate regarding the diagnostic accuracy of potential tests (urinalysis for microscopic hematuria, urine cytology, or tests for urine biomarkers) for identifying bladder cancer in asymptomatic persons with no history of bladder cancer.</p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Detection and Early Intervention</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence that screening for bladder cancer or treatment of screen-detected bladder cancer leads to improved disease-specific or overall morbidity or mortality.</p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Detection and Early Intervention</h3>\r\n<p>Screening may yield false-positive results. False-positive results may lead to anxiety, labeling, pain, and additional complications that result from diagnostic cystoscopy and biopsy (such as bladder perforation, bleeding, and infection) or imaging. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the harms of screening for bladder cancer. Evidence on the harms associated with early treatment, which may occur more frequently with greater detection of cases of early-stage cancer, is also inadequate.</p>\r\n<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to determine the balance of benefits and harms of screening for bladder cancer in asymptomatic adults.</p>\r\n<p><a id=\"clinical\" name=\"clinical\"></a></p>","clinical":"<h2>Clinical Considerations</h2><h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>\r\n<p>This recommendation applies to asymptomatic adults. Although adults with mild lower urinary tract symptoms (such as urinary frequency, hesitancy, urgency, dysuria, or nocturia) are not strictly asymptomatic, these symptoms are quite common and are not believed to be associated with an increased risk for bladder cancer. The USPSTF considered it reasonable to include these persons in the population under consideration for screening. Adults with gross hematuria or acute changes in lower urinary tract symptoms are not included in this population.</p>\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>Primary care-feasible screening tests for bladder cancer include identifying hematuria with a urine dipstick or microscopic urinalysis, urine cytology, and tests for urine biomarkers.</p>\r\n<h3>Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>Once bladder cancer has been diagnosed, several factors determine treatment, including tumor grade, cancer stage (superficial vs. invasive), whether the tumor is recurrent, the patient's age and overall health status, and patient and physician preferences. The principal treatment for superficial (Ta or T1) bladder cancer is transurethral resection of the bladder tumor, which may be combined with adjuvant radiation therapy, intravesical chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or photodynamic therapies. Radical cystectomy, often with adjuvant or neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy, is used in cases of surgically resectable invasive bladder cancer.</p>\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding I Statement</h3>\r\n<p>In deciding whether to screen for bladder cancer, clinicians should consider the following.</p>\r\n<h4><em>Potential Preventable Burden</em></h4>\r\n<p>Bladder cancer is similar to many other types of cancer in that it is a heterogeneous condition. Approximately 70% of all cases of newly diagnosed transitional cell carcinomas present as superficial tumors (including in situ); some of these tumors may never progress to advanced disease. However, some cases of bladder cancer invade the muscle tissue, progress, and metastasize; treatment has limited efficacy in these cases. Early detection of tumors with malignant potential may have an important effect on the mortality rate of bladder cancer. One challenge of screening for bladder cancer is accurately identifying cases of early-stage cancer (subepithelial and in situ) with a high risk for progression. Another area of uncertainty is determining whether providing earlier, less toxic treatment (such as immunotherapy) with the intention of preventing symptomatic progression results in fewer overall harms to the patient than providing more toxic treatment (such as radical cystectomy) only to those patients who develop symptomatic or advanced tumors. Persons at increased risk for bladder cancer include those who work in the rubber, chemical, or leather industries, as well as those who smoke, are male, are older, or have a family or personal history of bladder cancer.</p>\r\n<h4><em>Potential Harms</em></h4>\r\n<p>False-positive test results may result in anxiety and unneeded evaluations, diagnostic-related harms from cystoscopy and biopsy, harms from labeling or unnecessary treatments (such as transurethral resection of a bladder tumor, intravesical chemotherapy, or biologic therapies), and overdiagnosis.</p>\r\n<h4><em>Current Practice</em></h4>\r\n<p>Screening tests feasible for use in primary care include urine dipstick or microscopic urinalysis for hematuria, urine cytology, and tests for urine biomarkers. Tests for urine biomarkers are not commonly used in primary care in part because of their cost, although this varies substantially. Patients with positive screening results are typically referred to a urologist for further evaluation, which may include cystoscopy (and biopsy if a tumor is found), imaging, and other studies.</p><h2>Other Considerations</h2><h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\n<p>Several gaps in the evidence led the USPSTF to issue an I statement. Addressing these research needs could potentially provide sufficient evidence for the USPSTF to issue future screening recommendations. Cohort studies are needed to evaluate the natural history of early-stage, untreated bladder cancer (particularly that detected by screening) to allow a greater understanding of the potential overdiagnosis and overtreatment associated with screen-detected bladder cancer. Studies that compare the diagnostic accuracy of urine screening tests in representative populations are needed, as well as studies that assess the effect of screening on the incidence of bladder cancer, tumor characteristics, and subsequent treatments. Randomized, controlled trials or well-designed case-control studies that evaluate clinical outcomes in screened versus unscreened populations, which would provide direct evidence on benefits and harms of screening, have highest priority. Targeting populations at increased risk for bladder cancer because of patient characteristics or occupational exposure may be preferred to enhance feasibility and maximize clinical relevance. A better understanding of the harms related to screening and treatment are required. Methods for evaluating these harms could include conducting observational studies based on patient registries or large pharmacoepidemiologic databases. As noted, prospective cohort studies are needed to more accurately identify cases of early-stage cancer (subepithelial and in situ) with a high risk for progression. Future research should also clarify the trade-offs of using less-toxic treatments earlier and more frequently, to prevent symptomatic progression, versus using treatments with greater toxicity, which are typically reserved for those patients who develop symptomatic or advanced tumors.</p><h2>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h2><p>In 2004, the USPSTF recommended against routine screening for bladder cancer in adults because the USPSTF concluded that the harms outweighed the benefits of screening (D recommendation)<sup>2</sup>. In 2009, the USPSTF performed a targeted literature review and found insufficient evidence to assess the benefits and harms of screening for bladder cancer. In 2004, the USPSTF concluded that the harms outweighed the benefits; however, this time the USPSTF reviewed mortality statistics and other epidemiologic data that suggested heretofore undemonstrated benefits of screening. As a result, the USPSTF changed its recommendation from a D to an I statement (insufficient evidence).</p>","other":"<h2>Recommendations of Others</h2><p>No major organization recommends screening for bladder cancer in asymptomatic adults. In 2011, the American Academy of Family Physicians endorsed the USPSTF recommendation<sup>9</sup>. The European Association of Urology states that the best approach to primary prevention of muscle-invasive bladder cancer is to eliminate active and passive smoking<sup>10</sup>. The American Cancer Society states that prompt attention to bladder symptoms is the best approach for finding bladder cancer in its earliest, most treatable stages in persons with no known risk factors<sup>11</sup>.</p>","discussion":"<h2>Discussion</h2><h3>Burden of Disease</h3>\r\n<p>The incidence of bladder cancer in the United States is approximately 21 cases per 100,000 persons or 0.02%. It is the seventh-leading cause of death due to solid cancer in the United States. In 2009, an estimated 70,980 new cases of bladder cancer were diagnosed, and approximately 14,330 people died of the disease. In comparison, in 2009 there were an estimated 219,440 new cases of lung cancer and 159,390 deaths, 146,970 new cases of colorectal cancer and 49,920 deaths, 192,280 new cases of prostate cancer and 27,360 deaths, and 11,270 new cases of cervical cancer and 4070 deaths<sup>1</sup>.</p>\r\n<p>Bladder cancer is a heterogeneous condition with a variable natural history. It also has a relatively low mortality rate relative to the incidence of new cases. As a result, risk for overdiagnosis and overtreatment is a major issue in bladder cancer screening. Thus, it is important to identify superficial tumors that are at high risk for progression and target treatment at an earlier, more treatable stage in persons with such tumors, while minimizing unnecessary treatments in those unlikely to have disease-specific morbidity or mortality<sup>1</sup>.</p>\r\n<p>Persons at increased risk for bladder cancer include those who smoke or have occupational exposure to carcinogens, such as those who work in the rubber, chemical, or leather industries. Other risk factors for bladder cancer include male sex, older age, white race, infections caused by certain bladder parasites, and a family or personal history of bladder cancer<sup>1</sup>.</p>\r\n<h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n<p>To update its 2004 recommendation on screening for bladder cancer in asymptomatic persons<sup>2</sup>, the USPSTF reviewed the current state of the evidence and identified new evidence that addresses previously identified gaps. The USPSTF reviewed new evidence on the benefits and harms of screening, the accuracy of primary care-feasible screening tests, and the benefits and harms of treatment.</p>\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>Primary care&ndash;feasible screening tests for bladder cancer include urinalysis for hematuria, urinary cytology, and tests for other urine biomarkers. No evidence was found regarding the diagnostic accuracy of screening tests in asymptomatic persons<sup>3</sup>.</p>\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no direct evidence that bladder cancer screening is associated with improved health outcomes compared with no screening. The USPSTF could not evaluate the effectiveness of treatments for screen-detected bladder cancer because of a lack of studies that compare clinical outcomes associated with treatment versus no treatment<sup>3</sup>.</p>\r\n<h3>Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the harms associated with bladder cancer screening. In screening studies, the positive predictive value of various tests was less than 10%, which suggests a significant burden of unnecessary follow-up procedures and associated harms<sup>3</sup>. However, the USPSTF found no reliable data with which to estimate the incremental harms associated with screening for bladder cancer compared with no screening, or the harms associated with treatment of screen-detected bladder cancer versus no treatment.</p>\r\n<p>Potential harms of screening for bladder cancer include false-positive test results and unnecessary subsequent diagnostic procedures, as well as earlier initiation of routine surveillance. Follow-up of positive screening results typically includes cystoscopy and may include imaging studies. Potential harms include anxiety, labeling, discomfort or pain related to cystoscopy, and complications related to cystoscopy and biopsy (such as perforation, bleeding, or infection) or imaging (such as adverse effects related to the use of intravenous contrast)<sup>4-7</sup>.</p>\r\n<p>In lower-prevalence populations, more patients are potentially exposed to unnecessary harms because of a higher rate of false-positive results than in higher-prevalence populations.</p>\r\n<p>One large, uncontrolled observational study of 2821 patients<sup>8</sup> reported bleeding and perforation in 2.8% and 1.3%, respectively, of patients who underwent transurethral resection of a bladder tumor. However, the incremental harms that may have occurred because of screening cannot be estimated from the data. As noted, the risk for overdiagnosis and overtreatment is substantial because of the relatively low mortality rate. Thus, it is important to assess the harms related to overtreating screen-detected bladder cancer that is unlikely to progress to death or disability.</p>\r\n<h3>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the diagnostic accuracy of screening tests for bladder cancer. The USPSTF also found inadequate evidence on the effectiveness of treatment and the harms of screening or treatment. Therefore, the USPSTF concluded that the evidence on the benefits and harms of screening is lacking.</p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comments</h3>\r\n<p>A draft of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web site from 30 November 2010 to 28 December 2010.

Ninety percent of all cases of oral cavity and pharyngeal cancer are classified as squamous-cell carcinoma <sup>1</sup>. An estimated 41,380 new cases of and 7890 deaths from cancer of the oral cavity and pharynx will occur in 2013 <sup>2</sup>. At the time of diagnosis, more than 50% of persons with oral and pharyngeal cancer have regional or distant metastases <sup>3</sup>. Screening for oral cancer may be helpful if potentially malignant disorders can be identified earlier and treated successfully.</p>\r\n<p>Oral and oropharyngeal cancer have different causes. Oral cavity cancer is predominantly caused by tobacco and alcohol use. Oropharyngeal cancer, another subset of neck and head cancer, includes human papillomavirus (HPV) as an important risk factor. The incidence and mortality rate of oral cancer has been decreasing in the United States presumably because of reduced tobacco and alcohol use. However, HPV-related oropharyngeal cancer is increasing in incidence. Oropharyngeal cancer includes lesions of the tonsil, oropharynx, and base of the tongue. The epidemiology of HPV-related oropharyngeal cancer is evolving and could have important implications for identifying high-risk populations that might benefit from screening.</p>\r\n<h3>Detection</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence that the oral screening examination accurately detects oral cancer.</p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Detection and Early Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence that screening for oral cancer and treatment of screen-detected oral cancer improves morbidity or mortality.</p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Detection and Early Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the harms of screening. No study reported on harms from the screening test or from false-positive or false-negative results. Potential diagnostic harms are primarily related to the harms of biopsy for suspected oral cancer or its potential precursors. Harms of treatment for screen-detected oral cancer and its potentially malignant precursors (leukoplakia and erythroplakia) may result from complications of surgery (first-line treatment), radiation, and chemotherapy. The natural history of screen-detected oral cancer or potentially malignant disorders is unclear; thus, the magnitude of overdiagnosis due to screening is unknown.</p>\r\n<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to determine the balance of benefits and harms of screening for oral cancer in asymptomatic adults by primary care providers.</p>","clinical":"<h2>Clinical Considerations</h2><p><a id=\"consider\" name=\"consider\"></a></p>\r\n<h3>Importance</h3>\r\n<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>\r\n<p>This recommendation applies to asymptomatic adults aged 18 years or older who are seen by primary care providers. This recommendation focuses on screening (visual inspection and palpation) of the oral cavity performed by primary care providers and not dental providers or otolaryngologists.</p>\r\n<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>\r\n<p>Tobacco and alcohol use are major risk factors for oral cancer. A total of 20% to 30% of cases of oral cancer worldwide are attributable to cigarette smoking <sup>1</sup>. In the United States, up to 75% of cases of oral cancer may be attributable to tobacco and alcohol use <sup>4</sup>. Additional risk factors include male sex, older age, use of betel quid, ultraviolet light exposure, infection with <em>Candida</em> or bacterial flora, and a compromised immune system <sup>1</sup>.</p>\r\n<p>Sexually transmitted oral HPV infection (HPV-16) has recently been recognized as an increasingly important risk factor for oropharyngeal cancer. In the United States, the prevalence of oropharyngeal cancer due to oral HPV infection is probably as high as 80% to 95% <sup>5</sup>. The prevalence of oral HPV infection is associated with age, sex, number of sexual partners, and number of cigarettes smoked per day. The effect of multifactorial risk assessment and screening for risk factors on oral cancer morbidity and mortality is unknown <sup>1</sup>.</p>\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>The primary screening test for oral cancer is a systematic clinical examination of the oral cavity. According to the World Health Organization and the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, an oral cancer screening examination should include a visual inspection of the face, neck, lips, labial mucosa, buccal mucosa, gingiva, floor of the mouth, tongue, and palate. Mouth mirrors can help visualize all surfaces. The examination also includes palpating the regional lymph nodes, tongue, and floor of the mouth. Any abnormality that lasts for more than 2 weeks should be reevaluated and considered for biopsy <sup>1,6</sup>.</p>\r\n<p>Oropharyngeal cancer is difficult to visualize and is usually located at the base of the tongue (the back third of the tongue), the soft palate (the back part of the roof of the mouth), the tonsils, and the side and back walls of the throat. A comprehensive examination of the oropharynx may require referral to a dental provider or specialist, which is outside the scope of this recommendation.</p>\r\n<p>Additional tests proposed as adjuncts to the oral cancer screening examination include toluidine blue dye staining, chemiluminescent and autofluorescent lighting devices, and brush cytopathology. These screening and adjunct tests have not been adequately tested in primary care nondental settings. Although there is interest in screening for oral HPV infection, medical and dental organizations do not recommend it. Currently, no screening test for oral HPV infection has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Evaluating the accuracy of tests that detect oral HPV infection is a potentially promising area of research.</p>\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>\r\n<p>This recommendation is intended for primary care providers and does not pertain to dental providers or otolaryngologists. Dental care providers and otolaryngologists may conduct a comprehensive examination of the oral cavity and pharynx during the clinical encounter. In deciding whether to screen for oral cancer, primary care providers should consider the following factors.</p>\r\n<p><em>Potential Preventable Burden</em></p>\r\n<p>Up to 75% of cases of oral cancer may be attributed to tobacco and alcohol use <sup>4</sup>. Since 1979, the incidence rate of oral cavity cancer in the United States has been decreasing because of the reduced consumption of alcohol and smoking prevalence <sup>1</sup>.</p>\r\n<p>During this period, the incidence of HPV-positive oropharyngeal squamous-cell carcinoma has increased. Cancer registry data have shown that from 1988 to 2004, HPV-negative oropharyngeal cancer has decreased from 2.0 cases to 1.0 case per 100,000 persons and HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer has increased more than 3-fold from 0.8 case to 2.6 cases per 100,000 persons <sup>7</sup>. The overall prevalence of oral HPV infection is estimated to be 6.9% in adults aged 14 to 69 years in the United States. However, HPV prevalence can be as high as 20% for persons who have more than 20 lifetime sexual partners or currently use tobacco (more than 1 pack of cigarettes per day) <sup>8</sup>.</p>\r\n<p>The prevalence of type-specific HPV-16 oral infection is estimated at 1% in adults aged 14 to 69 years (an estimated 2.13 million infected persons) <sup>8</sup>. Human papillomavirus-16 is associated with approximately 85% to 95% of cases of HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer <sup>5</sup>. Therefore, the increasing role of oral HPV infection as a risk factor for oropharyngeal cancer may warrant future assessment of the independent effect of HPV-16 on incidence and outcomes of oropharyngeal cancer and the health effect of screening persons who are HPV-16&ndash;positive.</p>\r\n<p><em>Potential Harms</em></p>\r\n<p>Suspected oral cancer or its precursors (such as erythroplakia, due to its high risk for transformation to cancer) detected through examination require confirmation by tissue biopsy, which may lead to harms. Harms of treatment of screen-detected oral cancer and its potential precursors (leukoplakia and erythroplakia) may result from complications of surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. The natural history of screen-detected oral cancer is not well-understood, and as a result, the harms from overdiagnosis and overtreatment are unknown.</p>\r\n<p><em>Current Practice</em></p>\r\n<p>In a 2008 survey of U.S. adults, 29.4% of those aged 18 years or older reported ever having an oral cancer examination in which a physician, dentist, or other health professional pulled on their tongue or palpated their neck. It is unknown what percentage of these examinations were conducted by dentists rather than physicians or other health professionals. Adults aged 40 years or older are more likely to have ever had an examination than those aged 18 to 39 years, despite smoking status. Adults who are most at risk for oral cancer (current smokers aged &ge;40 years) are less likely to have ever had an oral cancer examination than former smokers or adults who have never smoked <sup>1</sup>.</p>\r\n<h3>Other Approaches to Prevention</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF recommends that clinicians screen all adults for tobacco use, recommend against tobacco use, and provide tobacco cessation interventions for those who use tobacco products <sup>9</sup>. The USPSTF also recommends screening and behavioral counseling interventions in primary care settings to reduce alcohol misuse by adults <sup>10</sup>.</p><h2>Other Considerations</h2><h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\n<p>One of the most important research needs is a randomized, controlled trial assessing the benefits and harms of oral cancer screening in U.S. persons who are at increased risk, such as those with a history of tobacco and heavy alcohol use. Continued research is needed to determine the accuracy of primary care providers, dental hygienists, dentists, or other trained persons screening U.S. patients who are at increased risk. Also needed is longitudinal follow-up of screening studies applicable to the United States that will show the health effect of screening for oral cancer and a clear understanding of who is at high risk in the United States. In addition, given the higher risks for death from oral cancer among African Americans and men, more research is warranted about the risks and benefits of screening in these populations.</p>\r\n<p>If HPV continues to become a more clinically significant risk factor for oropharyngeal cancer, the benefits of screening for HPV and selection of populations for oral cancer screening based on HPV status will need to be assessed. As the epidemiology evolves, the most effective screening examination will need to be determined. No screening test for oral HPV infection has been approved by the FDA. More research is needed to determine the benefits and harms of screening for oropharyngeal cancer. Other areas of research include learning about the natural history of oral HPV infection.</p>\r\n<p>Vaccines that reduce the risk for HPV infection are available. Whether current vaccines can prevent infection at noncervical sites and help reduce the risk for oropharyngeal cancer is unknown. Research is needed to assess the efficacy of HPV vaccines in preventing infection at noncervical sites and in decreasing the risk for oropharyngeal cancer.</p><h2>Update of the Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h2><p>In 2004, the USPSTF issued an I statement for screening for oral cancer because it found no evidence that screening for oral cancer led to improved health outcomes and no evidence on the harms of screening or the benefits of early treatment <sup>12</sup>.</p>\r\n<p>In the current recommendation, the USPSTF found inadequate evidence that the oral screening examination accurately detects oral cancer. It also found inadequate evidence that screening for oral cancer and treatment of screen-detected oral cancer improves morbidity or mortality. The evidence for screening for oral cancer remains insufficient; therefore, the USPSTF is unable to make a recommendation in favor of or against screening (I statement).</p>","other":"<h2>Recommendations of Others</h2><p>The American Academy of Family Physicians concluded that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for oral cancer in asymptomatic adults <sup>15</sup>. The American Cancer Society recommends that adults aged 20 years or older who have periodic health examinations should have the oral cavity examined as part of a cancer-related checkup <sup>16</sup>. The American Dental Association recommends that providers remain alert for signs of potentially malignant lesions or early-stage cancer in patients during routine oral examinations, particularly for patients who use tobacco or have heavy alcohol consumption <sup>17</sup>.</p>","discussion":"<h2>Discussion</h2><h3>Burden of Disease</h3>\r\n<p>According to a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and National Cancer Institute, there were 35,807 cases of oral and pharyngeal cancer in the United States in 2009, the most recent year of data available <sup>2</sup>. Nearly three fourths of all cases occur in men, making it the eighth most common cancer in men (it is the 14th most common cancer in women) in the United States.</p>\r\n<p>More than one half of all persons with oral and pharyngeal cancer have regional or distant metastases at diagnosis. Relative 5-year survival is 82.4% for localized disease, 55.5% for regional lymph node spread, and 33.2% for distant metastases <sup>1,3</sup>. Patients with HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer are diagnosed an average 5 years younger and have better survival than patients with HPV-negative oral cancer <sup>4</sup>.</p>\r\n<p>African Americans previously had higher incidence rates of oral and pharyngeal cancer than white persons. However, current data indicate a change in racial or ethnic incidence rates, such that white men and women now have higher incidence rates <sup>3</sup>. This change in incidence is ascribed to increases in HPV-related oral and pharyngeal (including oropharyngeal) cancer in white persons, along with a reduction in HPV-related and non&ndash;HPV-related oral and pharyngeal cancer in African Americans <sup>11</sup>. American Indian and Alaska Native, Asian and Pacific Islander, and Latino men and women have lower incidence rates than white and African American men and women. Mortality rates are substantially higher in African Americans and in men; mortality rates in American Indian and Alaska Native men are about the same as in white men, but Asian, Pacific Islander, and Latino men have lower mortality rates than white men <sup>3</sup>.</p>\r\n<h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n<p>The previous USPSTF recommendation found no evidence that screening for oral cancer led to improved health outcomes and no evidence on the harms of screening or the benefits of early treatment <sup>12</sup>. To update its previous recommendation, the USPSTF reviewed evidence to answer the following questions: 1) Does screening for oral cancer reduce morbidity or mortality? and 2) How accurate is the screening oral examination for identifying oral cancer or potentially malignant disorders that have a high likelihood of progression to oral cancer? The focus of this recommendation is screening (visual inspection and palpation) of the oral cavity performed by primary care providers and not dental providers or otolaryngologists.</p>\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>No evidence was found on screening for oral cancer in the general or high-risk U.S. population. Seven studies (<em>n</em> = 49,120) examined the performance characteristics of the oral screening examination. These studies were generally conducted in settings with an increased incidence of and mortality rate from oral cancer (India and Taiwan) compared with U.S. rates. The studies also had considerable heterogeneity in who performed the screening and greatly varied in test performance characteristics <sup>1</sup>.</p>\r\n<p>Across the 7 studies, sensitivity for oral cancer or potentially malignant disorders ranged from 18.0% to 94.3% and specificity ranged from 54.0% to 99.9%. The positive predictive value ranged from 17.0% to 86.6%, and the negative predictive value ranged from 73.0% to 99.3% <sup>1</sup>.</p>\r\n<p>Two studies in the United Kingdom assessed oral examinations performed by general dentists in older adults (aged &ge;40 years) who were at increased risk because of alcohol and tobacco use and in a mixed sample with unknown risk factors. The dental examination in the high-risk sample (<em>n</em> = 2027) showed a sensitivity of 74%, specificity of 99%, and positive predictive value of 67%, whereas the study of patients with unknown risk factors found a sensitivity of 71%, specificity of 99%, and positive predictive value of 86%. Although the patients in the U.K. study may be similar to those in the U.S. population, the results of these studies are limited by an imperfect reference standard (comparison with a &ldquo;more expert&rdquo; examiner), by combining the detection of potentially malignant disorders with that of oral cancer, and by an unclear delineation of high-risk status. These results would need to be confirmed by studies with longitudinal follow-up <sup>1</sup>.</p>\r\n<p>When compared with expert or trained screening examinations, self-examinations in 2 studies performed in India and the United Kingdom were insensitive (18% and 33%, respectively) <sup>1</sup>. Toluidine blue was not found to significantly improve screening for premalignant or malignant lesions, did not affect the incidence of oral cancer, and did not improve outcomes (1 study). No acceptable evidence for other adjunctive devices was found in the literature <sup>1</sup>.</p>\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>No direct evidence was available on whether screening reduces morbidity or mortality in general or high-risk U.S. populations. One fair-quality, randomized, controlled trial of home-based screening for oral cancer by advanced health workers (<em>n</em> = 191,873) conducted in Kerala, India, found no statistical difference in oral cancer mortality rates between screening and control groups after 9 years of follow-up (rate ratio, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.51 to 1.22]) <sup>1,10</sup>. After an additional screening round and 15 years of follow-up, oral cancer mortality ratios were of similar magnitude and not statistically significant <sup>13</sup>. Screened participants were diagnosed with oral cancer at earlier stages with a greater 5-year survival than control participants, possibly as a result of lead-time bias <sup>1,14</sup>.</p>\r\n<p>A post hoc subgroup analysis of participants in the Kerala study who reported tobacco and alcohol use (<em>n</em> = 84,600) found a significant reduction in oral cancer mortality rates in those assigned to the screening group (rate ratio, 0.66 [CI, 0.45 to 0.95]). A similar post hoc analysis at 15 years suggested a diminished but still significant oral cancer mortality reduction in the screening group (rate ratio, 0.76 [CI, 0.60 to 0.97]) <sup>13</sup>. However, the subgroup analyses do not meet high-quality criteria. The results of the overall study and the post hoc subgroup analysis do not provide sufficient evidence on screening because of limited applicability to the U.S. population and methodological limitations, such as inadequate accounting for clustering in the results, low adherence to follow-up, imbalance in baseline risk factors, possible lead- and length-time bias, and not reporting harms of screening or how lesions were treated. In addition, these participants commonly chewed paan (a carcinogenic compound containing areca nut and betel leaf), which is not used in the United States and affects the generalizability of this study. India also has higher oral cancer incidence, prevalence, and mortality, as well as a different health care system, than the United States, which also affects the applicability of the study results in the U.S. population <sup>1,14</sup>.</p>\r\n<h3>Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>A potentially important harm of screening for oral cancer is adverse effects from biopsy or surgery performed on oral lesions that would have regressed spontaneously or not have progressed to cancer during a patient's lifetime (overdiagnosis and overtreatment). There was insufficient evidence on harms from the screening test or from false-positive or false-negative results.</p>\r\n<h3>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the diagnostic accuracy, benefits, and harms of screening for oral cancer. Therefore, the USPSTF was unable to determine the balance of benefits and harms.</p>\r\n<h3>How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?</h3>\r\n<p>The oral cancer examination is designed to detect oral cancer or potentially malignant disorders at earlier stages. However, visual examination or biopsy cannot reliably distinguish potentially malignant disorders from lesions that may spontaneously regress or not progress (overdiagnosis), and evidence that earlier treatment improves health outcomes is lacking. Test performance characteristics for the oral screening examinations also varied widely.</p>\r\n<p>The natural history of oropharyngeal cancer is not well-understood. Knowledge of this particular cancer is evolving as more is learned about the association between oropharyngeal cancer and HPV. More evidence is needed to address effective screening strategies, treatment, and primary prevention. Clinical outcomes may differ among countries based on predominant etiology because patients with HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer are generally diagnosed younger and survive longer than patients with HPV-negative oral cancer.</p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comments</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web site from 9 April to 6 May 2013. In response to these comments, the USPSTF added additional language to the Rationale, Clinical Considerations, and Discussion sections to emphasize that the recommendation statement applies to primary care providers and not dental providers. Additional language was added throughout the recommendation statement to further define oral cancer and oropharyngeal cancer. Language addressing HPV vaccination and screening tools was added to the Research Needs and Gaps section. Clarifying language about adjunct screening tools was added to the Accuracy of Screening Tests section. Additional language was also added to describe the oral cavity examination in the Clinical Considerations section.</p>","topic":"Oral Cancer: Screening","keywords":"Oral Cancer","pubDate":"2013-11-15","categories":["3"],"tool":["109","23"]},"351":{"topicType":"Screening","topicYear":2017,"uspstfAlias":"thyroid-cancer-screening","specific":[365],"title":"Thyroid Cancer: Screening","rationale":"<h2>Rationale</h2><h3>Importance</h3>\n\n<p>In 2013, the incidence rate of thyroid cancer in the United States was 15.3 cases per 100,000 persons, which is a significant increase from 1975, when the incidence rate was 4.9 cases per 100,000 persons.<sup>1</sup> The increase was 6.7% per year from 1997 to 2009, but the rate of increase has slowed to 2.1% per year in recent years (2009&ndash;2013).<sup>1</sup> Meanwhile, the change in mortality rate has increased by only about 0.7 deaths per 100,000 persons each year.<sup>1</sup> Most cases of thyroid cancer have a good prognosis.<sup>2</sup> The 5-year survival rate for thyroid cancer overall is 98.1% and varies from 99.9% for localized disease to 55.3% for distant disease.<sup>3</sup></p>\n\n<h3>Detection</h3>\n\n<p>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to estimate the accuracy of neck palpation or ultrasound as a screening test for thyroid cancer in asymptomatic persons.</p>\n\n<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\n\n<p>The USPSTF found inadequate direct evidence to determine whether screening for thyroid cancer in asymptomatic persons using neck palpation or ultrasound improves health outcomes. However, the USPSTF determined that the magnitude of benefit can be bounded as no greater than small, based on the relative rarity of thyroid cancer, the apparent lack of difference in outcomes between patients who are treated vs only monitored (ie, for the most common tumor types), and the observational evidence demonstrating no change in mortality over time after introduction of a population-based screening program.</p>\n\n<h3>Harms of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\n\n<p>The USPSTF found inadequate direct evidence to assess the harms of screening for thyroid cancer in asymptomatic persons. The USPSTF found adequate evidence to bound the magnitude of the overall harms of screening and treatment as at least moderate, based on adequate evidence of serious harms of treatment of thyroid cancer and evidence that overdiagnosis and overtreatment are likely consequences of screening.</p>\n\n<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>\n\n<p>The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for thyroid cancer in asymptomatic persons results in harms that outweigh the benefits.</p>\n","clinical":"<h2>Clinical Considerations</h2><h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>\n\n<p>This recommendation applies to screening in asymptomatic adults. It does not apply to persons who experience hoarseness, pain, difficulty swallowing, or other throat symptoms or persons who have lumps, swelling, asymmetry of the neck, or other reasons for a neck examination. It also does not apply to persons at increased risk of thyroid cancer because of a history of exposure to ionizing radiation (eg, medical treatment or radiation fallout), particularly persons with a diet low in iodine, an inherited genetic syndrome associated with thyroid cancer (eg, familial adenomatous polyposis), or a first-degree relative with a history of thyroid cancer.<sup>4,5</sup></p>\n\n<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>\n\n<p>Although the USPSTF recommends against screening in the general asymptomatic adult population, several factors substantially increase the risk for thyroid cancer, including a history of radiation exposure to the head and neck as a child, exposure to radioactive fallout, family history of thyroid cancer in a first-degree relative, and certain genetic conditions, such as familial medullary thyroid cancer or multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome (type 2A or 2B).<sup>4</sup></p>\n\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\n\n<p>Although screening for thyroid cancer using neck palpation and ultrasound of the thyroid has been studied, the USPSTF recommends against screening in the general asymptomatic adult population.</p>\n\n<h3>Treatment and Interventions</h3>\n\n<p>Surgery (ie, total or partial thyroidectomy, with or without lymphadenectomy) is the main treatment of thyroid cancer. Additional treatment, including radioactive iodine therapy, may be indicated, depending on postoperative disease status, tumor stage, and type of thyroid cancer. External-beam radiation therapy and chemotherapy are not generally used to treat early-stage, differentiated thyroid cancer.</p>\n<h2>Other Considerations</h2><h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\n\n<p>The USPSTF found no direct studies that compared screened vs unscreened populations or immediate surgery vs surveillance or observation and reported health outcomes (ie, morbidity, mortality, quality of life, or harms). Trials or well-designed observational studies that address the benefit of screening in high-risk persons (ie, persons with a history of radiation or family history of differentiated thyroid cancer) are important for understanding how to best advise these patients. Trials or well-designed observational studies of early treatment vs surveillance or observation of patients with small, well-differentiated thyroid cancer are also needed to identify patients at greatest risk for clinical deterioration. Finally, risk prediction tools and molecular markers are needed to help understand the prognosis of differentiated thyroid cancer.</p>\n<h2>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h2><p>This is an update of the 1996 USPSTF recommendation.<sup>29</sup> In 1996, the USPSTF recommended against screening for thyroid cancer in asymptomatic adults using either neck palpation or ultrasound (D recommendation). In addition, using older methodology, the USPSTF issued a C recommendation for screening in asymptomatic adults with a history of radiation of the external upper body (primarily the head and neck) in infancy or childhood; in 1996, a C recommendation was defined as &quot;insufficient evidence to recommend for or against.&quot; The USPSTF focused its current recommendation on the general asymptomatic adult population.</p>\n","other":"<h2>Recommendations of Others</h2><p>The American Cancer Society does not specifically recommend screening for thyroid cancer using neck palpation or any other method.<sup>30</sup> In 1996, the American Academy of Family Physicians recommended against screening for thyroid cancer using neck palpation or ultrasound in asymptomatic persons.<sup>31</sup> The Canadian Task Force on the Periodic Health Examination does not include examination of the thyroid in its 2015 Preventive Care Checklist Form.<sup>32</sup> The American Thyroid Association<sup>33</sup> and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, American College of Endocrinology, and Associazione Medici Endocrinologi<sup>34</sup> issued guidelines for the diagnosis and management of thyroid nodules in 2016; these guidelines included no recommendation on screening for thyroid cancer in asymptomatic persons.</p>\n","discussion":"<h2>Discussion</h2><h3>Burden of Disease</h3>\n\n<p>An estimated 637,115 persons in the United States were living with thyroid cancer in 2013, according to data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program.<sup>3</sup> In 2017, an estimated 56,870 new cases of thyroid cancer will develop, representing 3.4% of all new cancer cases in the United States, and 2010 thyroid cancer&ndash;related deaths will occur (0.3% of all cancer deaths); the highest percentage of deaths will occur among adults aged 75 to 84 years (27.5%). The incidence of thyroid cancer detection has increased by 4.5% per year over the last 10 years, faster than for any other cancer, but without a corresponding change in the mortality rate, which remained at 0.5 deaths per 100,000 persons in 2013.<sup>6</sup> The estimated 5-year survival rate is 98% but ranges from 99% for localized disease (68% of cancer cases at diagnosis) to 55% for distant disease (4% of cancer cases at diagnosis).<sup>3,6</sup></p>\n\n<h3>Scope of Review</h3>\n\n<p>To update its 1996 recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a systematic evidence review<sup>7</sup> to examine the benefits and harms of screening for thyroid cancer in asymptomatic adults. The review also assessed the diagnostic accuracy of screening (including neck palpation and ultrasound) and the benefits and harms of treatment of screen-detected thyroid cancer, which were not part of the previous evidence review.</p>\n\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening Tests</h3>\n\n<p>Evidence on the accuracy of screening for thyroid cancer using neck palpation or ultrasound is very limited, with only 2 applicable studies for each screening method, all of which compared the screening method with a reference standard in a screening population. Two fair-quality prospective studies from Finland by the same investigator reported low sensitivity for neck palpation to detect thyroid nodules.<sup>8,9</sup> In a study of randomly selected adults (n=253), 5.1% had abnormal findings on neck examination (thyroid nodule or diffuse enlargement), and sensitivity and specificity to detect thyroid nodules were 11.6% (95% CI, 5.1% to 21.6%) and 97.3% (95% CI, 93.8% to 99.1%), respectively.<sup>7,8</sup> One study of women presenting for mammography (n=101) reported sensitivity of 27.8% for neck palpation to detect thyroid nodules in women with an abnormal ultrasound finding (women with negative neck palpation findings were not followed up, so the false-positive rate could not be estimated).<sup>7,9</sup></p>\n\n<p>Two fair-quality population-based studies, both conducted in South Korea by the same investigator, reported on diagnostic accuracy of screening using ultrasound only.<sup>10,11</sup> The prospective study (n=2079 screened; 113 referred for biopsy with fine needle aspiration) found that the sensitivity and specificity of having 1 or more malignant features (ie, microcalcification or irregular shape) detected on screening ultrasound were 94.3% (95% CI, 84.3% to 98.8%) and 55.0% (95% CI, 41.6% to 67.9%), respectively. A retrospective analysis of 130 asymptomatic persons selected from 1009 persons who had biopsy with fine-needle aspiration, based on ultrasound findings (ie, having &ge;2 high-risk sonographic characteristics), reported sensitivity and specificity of 94.8% and 86.6%, respectively (calculated per thyroid nodule rather than per patient; CIs not provided). However, this study did not follow up patients with negative ultrasound findings, and therefore may have overestimated the sensitivity of this screening method.</p>\n\n<h3>Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\n\n<p>No studies directly compared patient health outcomes for screened vs unscreened populations. No randomized trials evaluated whether earlier treatment or treatment of screen-detected, well-differentiated thyroid cancer results in better patient outcomes compared with observation (ie, delayed or no treatment).<sup>5</sup> Two observational studies (reported in 5 articles)<sup>12-16</sup> met the inclusion criteria for benefit of early treatment. One fair-quality, retrospective, observational study using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data from 1973 to 2005 compared survival rates of persons treated (n=35,663) vs not treated (n=440) for papillary thyroid cancer.<sup>12</sup> Overall, untreated persons had a slightly worse 20-year survival rate compared with treated persons (97% vs 99%; <em>P</em> &lt;0.001). However, there were statistically significant baseline differences between the 2 groups, and the study did not adjust for potential confounding.</p>\n\n<p>Another fair-quality prospective study conducted in Japan reported the recurrence and survival rates for 2 separate cohorts (1993&ndash;2004 and 2005&ndash;2013) with papillary microcarcinoma.<sup>13-16</sup> In the first cohort, 1055 persons chose treatment with immediate surgery and 340 opted for surveillance. After approximately 6 years of follow-up, 32.1% of patients who opted for surveillance had surgery, and 2 patients in the immediate surgery group and none in the observation group had died. In the second cohort, 974 persons opted for treatment with immediate surgery, and 1179 opted for active surveillance. After approximately 4 years of follow-up, 8% of patients who opted for active surveillance had surgery, and no patients in either group developed distant metastases or died of thyroid cancer. Because of major limitations in the design of both studies (eg, lack of adjustment for confounding), it is uncertain whether earlier or immediate treatment vs delayed or no surgical treatment improves patient outcomes for papillary carcinoma or microcarcinoma.</p>\n\n<h3>Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment</h3>\n\n<p>No studies directly examined the harms of screening for thyroid cancer using neck palpation or ultrasound. Overall, evidence on the harms of screening for thyroid cancer is very limited, including harms of diagnostic biopsy with fine-needle aspiration (eg, hospitalization, postprocedural hematoma, and needle tract implementation).<sup>5,17,18</sup> The USPSTF found 36 fair-quality studies reporting on surgical harms, 32 studies on permanent hypoparathyroidism (hypocalcemia), 28 studies on permanent recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy (vocal cord paralysis), 2 studies on surgical mortality, and 15 studies on other major surgical harms.<sup>7</sup> The majority of studies were retrospective observational studies, although 3 randomized trials were included. Cohort size ranged from 76 to 13,854 persons. Only 7 studies were conducted in the United States.</p>\n\n<p>Considerable evidence documents the harms of treatment with surgery and radioactive iodine therapy. The rate of permanent hypoparathyroidism varied widely (15 study arms); best estimates were 2 to 6 events per 100 total thyroidectomies, and estimates varied more with lymph node dissection. The rate of permanent recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy varied less (14 study arms), at an estimated 1 to 2 events per 100 operations (with or without lymph node dissection). Sixteen fair-quality studies (n=94,823) provided evidence for potential harms of radioactive iodine remnant ablation or therapy.<sup>7</sup> Estimates of a secondary malignancy ranged from approximately 12 to 13 excess cancers per 10,000 person-years,<sup>7,19,20</sup> and salivary gland harms (eg, dry mouth) ranged from 2.3 to 21 events per 100 persons.<sup>7,21-26</sup></p>\n\n<p>Although no direct studies of whether screening causes overdiagnosis exist, ecological and cross-sectional data suggest that screening for thyroid cancer leads to an increase in incidence without any resulting change in mortality.<sup>5</sup> Multiple studies in the United States show a rising incidence in thyroid cancer detection over time, with no corresponding change in the mortality rate.<sup>7</sup> The best ecological evidence on the overdiagnosis of thyroid cancer comes from South Korea, which has had an organized cancer screening program since 1999.<sup>27</sup> Although the program did not officially include screening for thyroid cancer, clinicians frequently offered thyroid screening using ultrasound for a small additional cost. In 2011, the rate of thyroid cancer diagnosis was 15 times the rate in 1993, while the thyroid cancer&ndash;specific mortality rate remained stable.<sup>27</sup></p>\n\n<p>Autopsy studies provide additional evidence on overdiagnosis of thyroid cancer. A 2014 review by Lee et al<sup>28</sup> summarizes 15 studies published between 1969 and 2005 on latent thyroid cancer discovered at autopsy. Of the 8619 thyroid glands incidentally obtained at autopsy, 989 (11.5%) tested positive for papillary thyroid carcinoma. The majority of the tumors were tiny (diameter &lt;1 to 3 mm).</p>\n\n<h3>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\n\n<p>The USPSTF found inadequate direct evidence on the benefits of screening but determined that the magnitude of the overall benefits of screening and treatment can be bounded as no greater than small, given the relative rarity of thyroid cancer, the apparent lack of difference in outcomes between treatment and surveillance (for the most common tumor types), and observational evidence showing no change in mortality over time after introduction of a mass screening program. Similarly, the USPSTF found inadequate direct evidence on the harms of screening but determined that the magnitude of the overall harms of screening and treatment can be bounded as at least moderate, given adequate evidence of harms of treatment and indirect evidence that overdiagnosis and overtreatment are likely to be substantial with population-based screening. Therefore, the USPSTF determined with moderate certainty that the net benefit of screening for thyroid cancer is negative.</p>\n\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\n\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from November 22 to December 26, 2016. Many respondents shared personal stories of how their clinician noticed a lump during physical examination, often prompted by symptoms such as hoarseness or throat pain, and expressed concern that the recommendation would prevent diagnosis of such cancer cases. Clinicians who interpreted the recommendation as discouraging them from performing neck examination also expressed concern. In response, the USPSTF expanded the Clinical Considerations section to clarify that this recommendation does not apply to persons who experience hoarseness, pain, difficulty swallowing, or other throat symptoms or persons who have lumps, swelling, asymmetry of the neck, or to other reasons for a neck examination.</p>\n","topic":"Thyroid Cancer: Screening","keywords":"Thyroid Cancer","pubDate":"2017-05-09","categories":["3"],"tool":[]},"352":{"topicType":"Screening","topicYear":2015,"uspstfAlias":"thyroid-dysfunction-screening","specific":[269],"title":"Thyroid Dysfunction: Screening","rationale":"<h2>Rationale</h2><h3>Importance</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Thyroid gland disorders are among the most common endocrine conditions evaluated and treated by clinicians. Thyroid dysfunction represents a continuum from asymptomatic biochemical changes to clinically symptomatic disease. In rare cases, it can produce life-threatening complications, such as myxedema coma or thyroid storm.<sup>1, 2</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Subclinical hypothyroidism</em> is defined as an asymptomatic condition in which a patient has a serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level exceeding the upper threshold of a specified laboratory reference interval (commonly but arbitrarily defined as 4.5 mIU/L) but a normal thyroxine (T4) level.<sup>3</sup> Patients with subclinical hypothyroidism are often further classified as having TSH levels between 4.5 and 10.0 mIU/L or greater than 10.0 mIU/L.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite its name, <em>&ldquo;overt&rdquo; hypothyroidism</em> does not require the presence of symptoms and has been defined biochemically by an elevated TSH level and a low T4 level. As such, it encompasses a range of low T4 levels that may (or may not) be associated with a set of relatively subtle and nonspecific clinical symptoms, such as fatigue, feeling cold, weight gain, hair loss, and constipation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Subclinical hyperthyroidism</em> is defined as an asymptomatic condition in which a patient has a serum TSH level below the lower threshold of a specified laboratory reference interval (usually 0.4 mIU/L) but normal T4 and triiodothyronine (T3) levels. Patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism are further classified as having &ldquo;low but detectable&rdquo; (about 0.1 to 0.4 mIU/L) or &ldquo;clearly low&rdquo; or &ldquo;undetectable&rdquo; (&lt;0.1 mIU/L) TSH levels.<sup>3</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite its name, <em>&ldquo;overt&rdquo; hyperthyroidism</em> does not require the presence of symptoms and has been defined biochemically by a low or undetectable TSH level and an elevated T4 or T3 level. When present, symptoms are often relatively nonspecific (for example, weight loss, heart palpitations, heat intolerance, and hyperactivity).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the purposes of this recommendation, <em>thyroid dysfunction</em> is defined as a spectrum of disorders related to the thyroid gland. The spectrum begins with asymptomatic subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. In the middle of the spectrum are asymptomatic &ldquo;overt&rdquo; hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, defined biochemically by changes in serum TSH and T4 levels. At the end of the spectrum is thyroid disease, which is reserved for symptomatic &ldquo;overt&rdquo; hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism (that is, persistently abnormal serum TSH and T4 levels and clearly associated clinical signs and symptoms that cannot be better explained by another condition).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In making its recommendations about clinical preventive services, the USPSTF focuses on asymptomatic populations that do not have known signs or symptoms of disease.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Detection</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Early detection and treatment of asymptomatic persons with abnormal serum TSH levels with or without abnormal T4 levels may be beneficial because it may prevent longer-term morbidity and mortality from fractures, cancer, or cardiovascular disease. However, widespread screening and treatment of subclinical thyroid dysfunction can also result in harms due to labeling, false-positive results, and overdiagnosis and overtreatment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that screening can detect &ldquo;abnormal&rdquo; serum TSH levels in asymptomatic persons. However, what constitutes an abnormal TSH level is uncertain. Laboratory reference intervals are based on the statistical distribution of TSH levels across the general population (for example, using the 97.5th percentile as an upper boundary for normal) rather than according to the association of a TSH level with symptoms, adverse outcomes, or particular risk factors for disease.<sup>3</sup> There is professional disagreement about the appropriate cut points for the lower and upper boundaries of normal TSH levels in the general population and in subgroups, such as older adults, where values differ from the overall population distribution (for example, shifting to a higher range of normal).<sup>4-7</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Accurate interpretation of serum TSH levels is further complicated by measurement variability and the sensitivity of TSH secretion to conditions other than thyroid dysfunction. These issues have led many professional groups to recommend repeating thyroid function tests if the results fall above or below a specified reference interval for confirmation of persistent dysfunction (for example, over 3- to 6-month intervals) in asymptomatic persons before making a diagnosis or considering any treatment strategies, unless the serum TSH level is greater than 10.0 or less than 0.1 mIU/L.<sup>3, 8, 9</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence that screening for thyroid dysfunction in nonpregnant, asymptomatic adults leads to clinically important benefits. In particular, the USPSTF found inadequate evidence to determine whether screening for thyroid dysfunction reduces cardiovascular disease or related morbidity and mortality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that screening for and treatment of thyroid dysfunction in nonpregnant, asymptomatic adults does not improve quality of life or provide clinically meaningful improvements in blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), bone mineral density, or lipid levels. It also does not improve cognitive function, at least through the duration of available trials (&ge;1 to 2 years).<sup>1, 2</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Harms of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the harms of screening for and treatment of thyroid dysfunction. Indirect evidence points to the likelihood of important and frequent harms associated with screening in asymptomatic persons. Foremost among these are frequent false-positive results; the psychological effects of labeling; and a large degree of overdiagnosis and overtreatment of biochemically defined abnormal TSH levels (with or without abnormal serum T4 levels) that may revert to normal, not progress, or never result in health problems even if they do progress, particularly in persons with TSH levels less than 10 mIU/L.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient and that the balance of benefits and harms of screening for thyroid dysfunction in nonpregnant, asymptomatic adults cannot be determined.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If clinicians offer screening for thyroid dysfunction to asymptomatic persons, they should first ensure that patients clearly understand the uncertainties surrounding any potential clinical benefit of screening as well as the possibility of harm this choice may engender.</p>","clinical":"<h2>Clinical Considerations</h2><p><a id=\"consider\" name=\"consider\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This recommendation applies to nonpregnant, asymptomatic adults.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>\r\n\r\n<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>About 5% of women and 3% of men in the United States have subclinical hypothyroidism.<sup>4</sup> Of note, several studies have shown that about 37% of persons with subclinical hypothyroidism spontaneously revert to a euthyroid state without intervention after several years.<sup>10, 11</sup> About 2% to 5% of persons with subclinical hypothyroidism develop &ldquo;overt&rdquo; thyroid dysfunction.<sup>12</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One retrospective cohort study found that levothyroxine use in persons with subclinical hypothyroidism was associated with lower risk for ischemic heart disease events and overall mortality;<sup>13</sup> however, the USPSTF did not identify any clinical trials that evaluated the causal relationship between treatment and subsequent cardiac events. The USPSTF did not identify any trials or observational studies that evaluated the effects of treatment of &ldquo;overt&rdquo; hypothyroidism (with or without symptoms) versus no treatment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Subclinical hyperthyroidism is present in about 0.7% of the U.S. population and is more common in women than men.<sup>4</sup> One quarter of persons with subclinical hyperthyroidism revert to a euthyroid state without medical intervention over time.<sup>10, 14</sup> An estimated 1% to 2% of persons with TSH levels less than 0.1 mIU/L develop &ldquo;overt&rdquo; hyperthyroidism (with or without symptoms). Persons with TSH levels between 0.1 and 0.45 mIU/L are unlikely to progress to &ldquo;overt&rdquo; hyperthyroidism.<sup>8</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF did not identify any studies that evaluated the benefits of treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism on final health outcomes, such as fractures, cancer, or cardiovascular morbidity or mortality. Except for 1 small (<em>n</em> = 67) nonrandomized study that examined bone mineral density, no evidence was found on the effects of treatment of &ldquo;overt&rdquo; hyperthyroidism (with or without symptoms).<sup>1, 2</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Potential Harms</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The harms of treatment of thyroid dysfunction have not been well-studied. The most important potential harms are false-positive results, labeling, and overdiagnosis and overtreatment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>False-positive results occur because TSH secretion is highly variable and sensitive to several common factors, such as acute illness or certain medications. Ascertainment of true- versus false-positive results is further complicated by a lack of consensus on what constitutes a normal reference interval.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Consensus is also lacking on the appropriate point for clinical intervention, particularly for hypothyroidism. No clinical trial data support a treatment threshold to improve clinical outcomes. On the basis of expert opinion, a TSH level greater than 10.0 mIU/L is generally considered the threshold for initiation of treatment (in part because of the higher likelihood of progression to &ldquo;overt&rdquo;&mdash;even if still asymptomatic&mdash;thyroid dysfunction). The decision of whether and when to begin therapy in patients with TSH levels between 4.5 and 10.0 mIU/L is more controversial.<sup>3, 15</sup> A large magnitude of overdiagnosis and overtreatment is a likely consequence of screening for thyroid dysfunction, particularly because the disorder is defined by silent biochemical parameters rather than a set of reliable and consistent clinical symptoms. The high variability of TSH secretion levels and the frequency of reversion to normal thyroid function without treatment underscore the importance of not relying on a single abnormal laboratory value as a basis for diagnosis or the decision to start therapy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Currently, it is not possible to differentiate persons who will have advancing thyroid dysfunction of clinical importance from those whose TSH levels will remain biochemically stable or even normalize. Treating the latter group (at a minimum) will not lead to benefit, and these persons may experience harms associated with antithyroid medications, ablation therapy, and long-term thyroid hormone therapy.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Current Practice</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Although exact estimates are not available for the United States, screening for thyroid dysfunction by primary care providers seems to be a common practice.<sup>16</sup> In the United Kingdom, an estimated 18% to 25% of the adult population receives thyroid function testing each year.<sup>17</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The annual number of dispensed prescriptions of levothyroxine sodium in the United States increased by 42% over a 5-year period, from 50 million in 2006 to 71 million in 2010.<sup>18</sup> In 2013, there were more than 23 million new prescriptions and refills for a single name brand of thyroid hormone in the United States, making it the most commonly prescribed drug in the country.<sup>19</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1996, a cross-sectional study of a U.S. population found that 39% of participants with TSH levels between 5.1 and 10.0 mIU/L received treatment.<sup>20</sup> More recent evidence suggests that the median TSH level at initiation of thyroid hormone therapy has decreased over time; a retrospective cohort study in the United Kingdom found that the median TSH level at the time of first levothyroxine prescription decreased from 8.7 to 7.9 mIU/L between 2001 and 2009.<sup>17</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Initiation and use of thyroid hormone therapy seem to be particularly common in older adults. Data from the CHS (Cardiovascular Health Study), a U.S. cohort of nearly 6000 community-dwelling adults aged 65 years or older, showed a steady increase in the overall percentage of older adults receiving thyroid hormone therapy (from 9% in 1989 to 20% in 2006) and a nonlinear probability of initiating levothyroxine therapy based on age; persons aged 85 years or older were more than twice as likely as those aged 65 to 69 years to begin thyroid hormone therapy (hazard ratio [HR], 2.34 [95% CI, 1.43 to 3.85]), independent of race or sex.<sup>21</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Data on the proportion of asymptomatic persons with thyroid dysfunction who receive thyroid hormone therapy are lacking. However, given the high number of prescriptions for levothyroxine dispensed in the United States and the low prevalence of &ldquo;overt&rdquo; hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism among persons in the general population (0.3% and 0.5%, respectively,<sup>4</sup> only a small fraction of whom are symptomatic), it is reasonable to conclude that many asymptomatic persons receive treatment. Clinicians seem to be treating more persons with thyroid dysfunction, at earlier times after initial diagnosis, and at TSH levels closer to normal.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The most common cause of hypothyroidism in the United States is chronic autoimmune (Hashimoto) thyroiditis. Risk factors for an elevated TSH level include female sex, advancing age, white race, type 1 diabetes, Down syndrome, family history of thyroid disease, goiter, previous hyperthyroidism (possibly due in part to ablation therapy leading to iatrogenic thyroid dysfunction), and external-beam radiation in the head and neck area.<sup>1, 2</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Common causes of hyperthyroidism include Graves disease, Hashimoto thyroiditis, and functional thyroid nodules. Risk factors for a low TSH level include female sex; advancing age; black race; low iodine intake; personal or family history of thyroid disease; and ingestion of iodine-containing drugs, such as amiodarone.<sup>1, 2</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no direct evidence that treatment of thyroid dysfunction based on risk level alters final health outcomes.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The serum TSH test is the primary screening test for thyroid dysfunction. Multiple tests should be done over a 3- to 6-month interval to confirm or rule out abnormal findings. Follow-up testing of serum T4 levels in persons with persistently abnormal TSH levels can differentiate between subclinical (normal T4 levels) and &ldquo;overt&rdquo; (abnormal T4 levels) thyroid dysfunction.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Screening Interval</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The optimal screening interval for thyroid dysfunction (if one exists) is unknown.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Interventions</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The principal treatment for hypothyroidism is oral T4 monotherapy (levothyroxine sodium).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hyperthyroidism is treated with antithyroid medications (such as methimazole) or nonreversible thyroid ablation therapy (for example, radioactive iodine or surgery). Although definitive data are lacking, treatment is generally recommended for patients with a TSH level that is undetectable or less than 0.1 mIU/L, particularly those with overt Graves disease or nodular thyroid disease. Treatment is typically not recommended for patients with TSH levels between 0.1 and 0.45 mIU/L or when thyroiditis is the cause.<sup>1, 2</sup></p><h2>Other Considerations</h2><h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Although detection and treatment of abnormal TSH levels (with or without abnormal T4 levels) in asymptomatic persons is common practice, evidence that this clinical approach improves important health outcomes is lacking. Long-term randomized, blinded, and controlled trials of screening for thyroid dysfunction would provide the most direct evidence on any potential benefits of this widespread practice. Serum TSH levels that define eligibility for enrollment, particularly based on age-specific ranges, are needed. Important clinical outcomes include cardiovascular- and cancer-related morbidity and mortality, as well as falls, fractures, functional status, and quality of life. Intermediate biochemical outcomes are less important; they are not reliable evidence of treatment effectiveness, and the effects of treatment of thyroid dysfunction on important clinical outcomes may be independent of any known intermediate outcomes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before conducting screening trials, it may be more feasible for researchers to conduct well-designed treatment trials of either subclinical or asymptomatic &ldquo;overt&rdquo; thyroid dysfunction versus watchful waiting (including intervention if overt dysfunction becomes symptomatic), using final health outcomes, such as cardiovascular-related morbidity and mortality, as the end points of interest. For such trials to be most informative, they should have clearly defined patient populations; intervention protocols (for example, treatment doses and target TSH levels); and study outcomes, including short- and long-term benefits and harms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Long-term observational studies are needed to better understand the natural history of untreated, asymptomatic thyroid dysfunction based on different serum TSH and T4 levels, as well as outcomes in persons with common but nonspecific symptoms. Useful information might be available from ongoing studies that collect biochemical samples; detailed demographic data; and information on functional status, quality of life, and other final health outcomes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Currently, the evidence does not show important benefits of treatment of subclinical thyroid dysfunction on blood pressure, BMI, lipid levels, cognitive function, or quality of life. Although treatment is associated with harms, it could have important long-term benefits on final health outcomes (such as reduced bone fractures and cardiovascular- and cancer-related morbidity and mortality) that may be independent of known intermediate outcomes. For example, evidence indicates that if treatment is effective for fractures or cardiovascular disease prevention, it is due to factors other than improvements in bone mineral density or lipid levels.<sup>13, 22</sup> The need for randomized trials that evaluate the effect of treatment of subclinical thyroid dysfunction on cardiac outcomes has been emphasized.<sup>13</sup> Given the increasingly popular clinical practice of routine identification and treatment of asymptomatic persons with thyroid dysfunction and the treatment of those with vague and nonspecific symptoms, these trials are warranted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Studies that evaluate the harms of screening for and treatment of thyroid dysfunction are critically lacking. The USPSTF believes that false-positive results, labeling, and overdiagnosis and overtreatment are important harms of any screening and prevention program and that these harms should be minimized. Additional evidence is needed on how to best communicate the clinical complexity surrounding screening for and treatment of asymptomatic thyroid dysfunction so that patients and their providers can make informed decisions.</p><h2>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h2><p>This recommendation replaces the 2004 USPSTF recommendation on screening for thyroid disease. In this update, the USPSTF has restricted its definition of thyroid disease to symptomatic &ldquo;overt&rdquo; hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism (that is, persistently abnormal serum TSH and T4 levels and clearly associated clinical signs and symptoms that cannot be better explained by another condition). There is a broad spectrum of thyroid disorders, and the USPSTF recognizes that screening with the serum TSH test can detect changes along any point in this spectrum. Thus, the USPSTF changed the scope of its recommendation statement to screening for thyroid dysfunction to emphasize that screening can detect biochemical abnormalities as well as potentially clinically important disease. Despite this change, the USPSTF&rsquo;s ultimate assessment is the same as in the previous recommendation; the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for thyroid dysfunction in nonpregnant, asymptomatic adults (I statement).</p>","other":"<h2>Recommendations of Others</h2><p>The American Thyroid Association and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists recommend considering screening for hypothyroidism in patients older than 60 years, as well as &ldquo;aggressive case finding&rdquo; (but not universal screening) in persons who are at increased risk for hypothyroidism and in women who are planning pregnancy.<sup>15</sup> In 2006, 3 British professional associations (the Association for Clinical Biochemistry, the British Thyroid Association, and the British Thyroid Foundation) jointly recommended against routine screening for thyroid dysfunction in a healthy adult population, although the panel favors aggressive case finding in women with nonspecific symptoms.<sup>44</sup> The American Academy of Family Physicians has endorsed the USPSTF recommendation.<sup>45</sup></p>","discussion":"<h2>Discussion</h2><h3>Burden of Condition</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Disorders of the thyroid gland are among the most common endocrine conditions evaluated and treated by clinicians. According to data from NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey), about 46 per 1000 persons in the United States have subclinical hypothyroidism, 7 per 1000 have subclinical hyperthyroidism, 3 per 1000 have &ldquo;overt&rdquo; hypothyroidism, and 5 per 1000 have &ldquo;overt&rdquo; hyperthyroidism.<sup>4</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Currently, the most common argument in favor of early treatment of thyroid dysfunction is the possible associations among untreated subclinical hypothyroidism, risk factors for heart disease, and subsequent coronary disease or heart failure. However, the epidemiological evidence for this argument is mixed, and the available studies (including several meta-analyses) had important methodological limitations, precluding certainty in their findings.<sup>3, 23-28</sup> If early treatment is effective in preventing coronary disease or heart failure, the current evidence suggests that it is probably through mechanisms other than mediation of blood pressure and lipid levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recently, 2 prospective studies&mdash;Health ABC (Health, Aging, and Body Composition Study)<sup>29</sup> and CHS<sup>30</sup>&mdash;showed a correlation between subclinical hypothyroidism and congestive heart failure, particularly in persons with a serum TSH level greater than 10.0 mIU/L (HRs, 3.26 [CI, 1.37 to 7.77] and 1.88 [CI, 1.05 to 3.34], respectively). This possible association warrants further study; however, it is not known whether thyroid replacement therapy would modify this potential risk.<sup>3</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF commissioned a systematic evidence review to update its 2004 recommendation on screening for thyroid disease. The review assessed the evidence on the benefits and harms of screening for subclinical and &ldquo;overt&rdquo; thyroid dysfunction without clinically obvious symptoms, as well as the effects of treatment of screen-detected subclinical and &ldquo;overt&rdquo; thyroid dysfunction on intermediate and final health outcomes. The review also evaluated the proportion of patients screened for thyroid dysfunction who have clinically apparent disease, the proportion with TSH levels of 10 mIU/L or less who are treated in current practice, and the cardiovascular consequences of untreated subclinical thyroid dysfunction.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening Tests</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>When used to confirm clinically suspected thyroid disease in patients referred to an endocrinologist, the serum TSH test has a sensitivity of about 98% and a specificity of about 92%.<sup>31</sup> However, its accuracy is more challenging to ascertain when it is used to screen asymptomatic persons for thyroid dysfunction, for several reasons. First, there is no consensus on the appropriate TSH cutoff for a diagnosis of subclinical hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. Most laboratories define an abnormal TSH test result by using the upper and lower limits of the 95% reference interval for a particular assay (generally about 0.4 to 4.5 mIU/L).<sup>3</sup> However, laboratories use varying types of assays.<sup>32</sup> More important, this threshold is arbitrary; it is not based on the risk for an adverse health outcome but simply a normal population distribution of values.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Second, TSH secretion varies among different subpopulations, such as those defined by race/ethnicity, sex, and age. For example, 12% of persons aged 80 years or older with no evidence of thyroid disease have been found to have TSH levels greater than 4.5 mIU/L.<sup>33</sup> Therefore the &ldquo;standard&rdquo; population reference interval for older adults is probably inappropriate.<sup>10, 34, 35</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Third, TSH secretion is highly sensitive to factors other than thyroid disorders. For example, serum TSH is frequently suppressed during phases of acute illness.<sup>3</sup> Levels of TSH may also be affected by the administration of drugs or substances, such as iodine, dopamine, glucocorticoids, octreotide, or bexarotene.<sup>1, 15</sup> Adrenal insufficiency, pregnancy (particularly during the first trimester), anorexia nervosa, certain autoimmune diseases, and pituitary adenomas can also interfere with normal circulating levels of TSH.<sup>3, 15</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fourth, serum TSH levels can vary by as much as 50% of mean values on a day-to-day basis, with up to 40% variation of values obtained from serial TSH measurements performed at the same time of day.<sup>36, 37</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>All of this confirms the importance of not relying on a single TSH value to establish a diagnosis of thyroid dysfunction. Serial TSH measurements are an essential step in establishing that a thyroid disorder is real and persistent.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n\r\n<h4>Early Detection</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>No studies directly evaluated the effects of screening for thyroid dysfunction on morbidity (including quality of life and functional status) or mortality in the general population.<sup>1, 2</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Treatment of Hypothyroidism</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Three trials (<em>n</em> = 239) found no statistically significant effect of treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism on blood pressure<sup>1, 2</sup> through 10.5 months of follow-up. Similarly, 6 trials (<em>n</em> = 385) found no statistically significant effect of treatment on BMI or weight<sup>1, 2</sup> through 1 year of follow-up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Evidence on the effect of treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism on lipid levels is mixed. Several trials suggested potential beneficial effects, but the results are inconsistent and of uncertain clinical importance. In 8 good- or fair-quality trials (<em>n</em> = 597), 3 of which reported statistically significant results, differences between the treatment and control groups ranged from &minus;0.7 to 0 mmol/L (&minus;28 to 0 mg/dL) for mean total cholesterol level and from &minus;0.6 to 0.1 mmol/L (&minus;22 to 2 mg/dL) for mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level.<sup>1, 2</sup> No studies reported statistically significant differences in levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol or triglycerides.<sup>1, 2</sup> Whether changes in these intermediate outcomes due to treatment are adequate surrogates for cardiovascular morbidity or mortality is not known, and no trials directly evaluated the effects of treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism on final health outcomes, such as cardiac morbidity or mortality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A single fair-quality retrospective cohort study by Razvi and colleagues examined the association between treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism and risk for cardiac events.<sup>13</sup> The study identified 4735 persons aged 40 years or older with subclinical hypothyroidism (based on a single TSH value of 5.01 to 10.0 mIU/L) from the U.K. General Practice Research Database. Mean follow-up was 7.6 years, and participants were categorized a priori into 2 age groups (40 to 70 years or &gt;70 years). After adjustment for age, sex, BMI, socioeconomic status, blood pressure, total cholesterol level, smoking status, history of diabetes mellitus, levothyroxine use, and index serum TSH level, levothyroxine use in the younger age group was associated with lower risk for fatal or nonfatal ischemic heart disease events (4.2% vs. 6.6%; HR, 0.61 [CI, 0.39 to 0.95]), death due to circulatory diseases (1.4% vs. 2.4%; HR, 0.54 [CI, 0.37 to 0.92]), and all-cause mortality (1.2% vs. 2.2%; HR, 0.59 [CI, 0.21 to 0.88]). There were no statistically significant associations between treatment and cardiovascular outcomes in the older age group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One limitation of this study is that it did not adjust for the use of medications that reduce risk for cardiovascular disease, such as aspirin or lipid-lowering therapy. Residual confounding for these and other variables could be present, although baseline data did not show differences between the treatment groups.<sup>13</sup> Although the results are promising and justify the prioritization of further research in this area, this study is ultimately hypothesis-generating rather than proof of effect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This study also reported an association between use of levothyroxine and reduced risk for any cancer death in persons aged 40 to 70 years (1.2% vs. 2.2%; HR, 0.59 [CI, 0.21 to 0.88]).<sup>13</sup> The authors noted that this was an unexpected finding that should therefore be interpreted with caution, particularly because it was not the primary study outcome. This finding further underscores the probable presence of residual confounding and emphasizes the need for experimental research to ascertain the true effect of treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism on cardiovascular outcomes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2004, the USPSTF identified 5 trials that evaluated the effects of treatment on quality of life in persons with subclinical hypothyroidism. Only 1 trial, in patients with recent Graves disease, found a positive effect of treatment.<sup>38</sup> Since then, 4 good- or fair-quality trials (<em>n</em> = 327) have been published, and none found a difference between persons receiving treatment and those receiving placebo through 1 year of follow-up.<sup>1, 2</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the previous USPSTF review, 1 good-quality (<em>n</em> = 94) and 1 fair-quality (<em>n</em> = 69) trial have each found no effect of treatment of screen-detected subclinical hypothyroidism on various measures of cognitive function (such as cognitive skills and performance, cognitive status, speed of cognitive processing, and psychomotor tests of executive function) after 1 year.<sup>39, 40</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>No studies evaluated the effects of treatment of &ldquo;overt&rdquo; hypothyroidism (with or without symptoms) versus no treatment on any outcome.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Treatment of Hyperthyroidism</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>No fair- or good-quality studies evaluated the benefits of treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism.<sup>1, 2</sup> Two small (<em>n</em> = 14 and 20) poor-quality trials found no differences between treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism and no treatment on blood pressure, BMI, bone mineral density, or lipid levels.<sup>1, 2</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only identified evidence relevant to &ldquo;overt&rdquo; hyperthyroidism was 1 small (<em>n</em> = 67) nonrandomized study that evaluated the effects of treatment on bone mineral density.<sup>41</sup> This study did not meet inclusion criteria and was not formally assessed as part of the systematic evidence review.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No trials evaluated the effects of treatment of hyperthyroidism (subclinical or &ldquo;overt&rdquo;) versus no treatment on final health outcomes.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Potential Harms of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n\r\n<h4>Screening</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>No studies directly examined the harms of screening for thyroid dysfunction. However, screening clearly has potential harms, the most important of which are false-positive results, psychological effects of disease labeling, and overdiagnosis and overtreatment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>False-positive results on serum TSH tests are common due to several factors. Secretion of TSH is sensitive to multiple factors unrelated to thyroid conditions; varies across time intervals, sometimes as short as a day; and varies depending on the population being considered (average TSH values may differ by age, sex, and race/ethnicity). In addition, there is no universally agreed-on &ldquo;normal&rdquo; TSH reference value, in part because it is not linked to the risk for actual adverse health outcomes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reliable estimates of the frequency of false-positive results from serum TSH tests are not available. A prospective observational study followed a cohort of 599 older adults after a single baseline TSH test, with repeated testing of 376 participants at the end of the study. It found that 37% (11 of 30) of participants with an initially elevated TSH level and 29% (5 of 17) with an initially low TSH level reverted to normal thyroid function after 3 years without intervention. Limitations of this study include the small number of affected participants, high loss to follow-up, and inability to distinguish between false-positive results and overdiagnosis with the methodological approach.<sup>10</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Labeling someone with a diagnosis of disease may have adverse psychological consequences, particularly in the case of an otherwise asymptomatic condition. Although the patient may have previously felt healthy, being informed that he or she has a disorder that requires medical surveillance or intervention can result in anxiety or changes to the patient&rsquo;s sense of well-being. A cross-sectional study of almost 34,000 persons aged 40 to 70 years found that women with known hypothyroidism were less likely to report good self-rated health compared with those without thyroid dysfunction (adjusted odds ratio, 0.49 [CI, 0.41 to 0.59]).<sup>42</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overdiagnosis of thyroid dysfunction is probably common, in part because the condition is defined biochemically rather than clinically and because disagreements persist about the appropriate cut points for classification of disease. The exact proportion of thyroid dysfunction diagnoses that are overdiagnoses is not known. However, many persons labeled with hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism spontaneously revert to a euthyroid state over time; others never progress to noticeable health problems, especially those who are asymptomatic and have &ldquo;mildly elevated&rdquo; (4.5 to 10.0 mIU/L) TSH levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1 prospective study, 102 women aged 60 years or older with subclinical hyperthyroidism (defined as a TSH level of 0.1 to 0.4 mIU/L, as measured at baseline and 12 weeks after study entry) but normal T3 and T4 levels were followed for a mean of 41 months without intervention. At the end of the study, 24 women (24%) had TSH levels that had spontaneously normalized.<sup>14</sup> A second prospective study evaluated the natural history of subclinical hypothyroidism. The study followed 107 persons aged 55 years or older with newly diagnosed subclinical hypothyroidism (defined as a TSH level &gt;5.0 mIU/L on 2 serial measurements before study entry) for a mean of 32 months without intervention. After this time, 40 participants (37%) had reverted to a euthyroid state. Of note, nearly half of the persons in this population had been referred to the study clinic by their general practitioner because of the incidental discovery of an elevated TSH level during routine &ldquo;analytical lab checking.&rdquo; Forty-four percent also reported 1 or more symptoms commonly associated with hypothyroidism.<sup>11</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overdiagnosis is of concern because it leads to the psychological consequences of labeling and unnecessary treatment. It is a fundamental harm that should be avoided in disease prevention and health promotion.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Treatment</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>As with screening, limited evidence is available to assess the harms of treatment of thyroid dysfunction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Levothyroxine therapy is a synthetic preparation of a natural hormone found in the body. Treatment of hypothyroidism with levothyroxine generally lasts for many years. Despite its previous widespread use in the United States, levothyroxine sodium was not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration until 2000. However, its approval process did not include studies that evaluated short- or long-term adverse effects. The product label cites possible adverse effects on bone mineral density and the cardiovascular system, such as angina, arrhythmia, and increased cardiac wall thickness.<sup>3</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The previous review found that one quarter of patients who received levothyroxine were inadvertently maintained on doses high enough to make TSH levels undetectable. Although the ultimate effect of long-term overdosing with levothyroxine is unknown, it could increase risk for osteoporosis, fractures, abnormal cardiac output, or ventricular hypertrophy.<sup>31</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Five trials published since the previous review assessed the harms of treatment of hypothyroidism with levothyroxine and generally reported no indication of harms or no or minimal (<em>n</em> = 0 to 2) withdrawals from treatment due to adverse effects. However, harms were poorly assessed and reported, and the studies were not designed or powered to evaluate long-term or serious harms or harms related to overtreatment.<sup>1, 2</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the case of asymptomatic hyperthyroidism, overtreatment may be of even greater concern given that one treatment option is ablation of the thyroid gland followed by thyroid replacement therapy. Patients who are overdiagnosed and overtreated could develop iatrogenic hypothyroidism and become dependent on lifelong thyroid hormone therapy. Overtreatment is also of concern because it can introduce opportunity costs; clinicians and patients may spend time focused on certain areas of health at the expense of other conditions or care needs that are of higher priority for the patient&rsquo;s overall well-being.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no direct evidence on the benefits and harms of screening for thyroid dysfunction in nonpregnant, asymptomatic adults and therefore considered the indirect evidence on screening accuracy, benefits of early treatment, and harms. There is adequate evidence that the serum TSH test can identify abnormal levels of the hormone; however, substantial debate surrounds what constitutes an abnormal TSH level. Thresholds vary for different populations, such as older adults. Although a single fair-quality observational study found a possible association between treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism with levothyroxine and reduced risk for cardiac events, there is no evidence from randomized trials to prove that early treatment of thyroid dysfunction leads to clinically important benefits. The harms of screening for and treatment of thyroid dysfunction have been poorly studied. However, screening and treatment have real potential harms, and these harms are probably common. Overall, the USPSTF was unable to estimate the balance of benefits and harms of screening for thyroid dysfunction in nonpregnant, asymptomatic adults.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web site from 28 October to 24 November 2014. In response to the comments received, the USPSTF clarified some of the terminology used in this statement (for example, &ldquo;reference interval&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;reference range&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hashimoto thyroiditis&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;Hashitoxicosis&rdquo;) and added a reference for initiation and use of thyroid hormone therapy in older adults. The USPSTF also clarified that the systematic evidence review searched for studies on the treatment of thyroid dysfunction that used placebo or no treatment as the comparator.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some comments noted that it would be unacceptable for clinicians to allow patients with &ldquo;overt&rdquo; thyroid dysfunction to participate in a trial with a placebo group (and that this therefore explains the lack of current evidence on the topic), but the USPSTF disagrees with this position. There are no high-quality data showing that treatment of &ldquo;overt&rdquo; thyroid dysfunction in asymptomatic persons affects important health outcomes, such as cardiovascular- and cancer-related morbidity and mortality, fractures, or quality of life and functional status. Given the widespread practice of screening for and treatment of thyroid dysfunction in asymptomatic persons and the absence of high-quality evidence on the effectiveness of this approach, a pressing research need for this field is well-designed randomized treatment trials of subclinical and &ldquo;overt&rdquo; thyroid dysfunction versus watchful waiting (with the important caveat that patients would be provided therapy if they became notably symptomatic).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is clear from the comments received that the current terminology used to describe disorders of the thyroid generates substantial confusion, not only among the public but among clinicians and researchers as well. The terms &ldquo;thyroid dysfunction&rdquo; and &ldquo;thyroid disease&rdquo; are frequently used interchangeably to encompass all forms of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, regardless of whether the patient has clinical signs or adverse consequences of illness. The term &ldquo;overt thyroid dysfunction&rdquo; is particularly misleading given that an &ldquo;overt&rdquo; (meaning &ldquo;done or shown openly; plainly or readily apparent&rdquo;<sup>43</sup>) condition is usually associated with obvious signs and symptoms of disease. In the case of thyroid dysfunction, &ldquo;overt&rdquo; dysfunction has been defined by biochemical parameters (serum TSH and T4 levels) that may not be associated with clinically evident symptoms or adverse health outcomes. The USPSTF believes that alternative terms are needed to more accurately describe thyroid dysfunction&mdash;reserving the term &ldquo;overt thyroid disease&rdquo; to describe symptomatic patients who also have persistently abnormal serum TSH and T4 levels.</p>","topic":"Thyroid Dysfunction: Screening","keywords":"Thyroid Disease","pubDate":"2015-03-24","categories":["4"],"tool":["116"]},"373":{"topicType":"Screening","topicYear":2017,"uspstfAlias":"celiac-disease-screening","specific":[352],"title":"Celiac Disease: Screening","rationale":"<h2>Rationale</h2><h3>Importance</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Celiac disease is a multisystem autoimmune disorder in genetically predisposed adults and children that is triggered by dietary gluten.

It may also manifest as nonspecific, nongastrointestinal symptoms, including anemia, osteoporosis, chronic fatigue, peripheral neuropathy or ataxia, and short stature.<sup>2</sup> Data from the United States suggest that some patients may have symptoms for years before being diagnosed.<sup>4</sup> Evidence also suggests that celiac disease is associated with excess mortality, intestinal adenocarcinoma, and lymphoma; however, evidence is insufficient as to whether silent, or asymptomatic, disease has the same risk as symptomatic disease.<sup>2,5-7</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 3 US-based studies, the prevalence of laboratory-confirmed celiac disease ranged from 0.40% to 0.95% among adults.<sup>1</sup> Some variations in prevalence can be attributed in part to the method used to confirm diagnosis.<sup>2</sup> For example, some population-based studies on prevalence rely on serologic testing without histologic confirmation, which may result in false-positive diagnoses and overestimate prevalence. However, in a systematic review of 38 studies from North America and Western Europe, prevalence of celiac disease was similar among studies that included biopsy confirmation (0.15% to 1.90%) and among studies that did not include biopsy confirmation (0.15% to 2.70%).<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Celiac disease affects children, adolescents, and adults. Seroconversion to antibodies associated with celiac disease may occur at any time, and disease progression can take months or years, if it occurs at all. Data suggest that the average age at diagnosis is now in the fourth to sixth decade of life.<sup>8,9</sup> Data are limited on the proportion of persons with silent celiac disease (positive histology findings but no symptoms) or potential celiac disease (positive serology findings but mild or no intestinal damage on biopsy) who later develop symptomatic celiac disease. Three long-term studies of US adults with follow-up ranging from 10 to 45 years reported rates of progression from positive serology findings to clinical diagnosis of celiac disease of 0% to 15%.<sup>10-12</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Persons at increased risk for celiac disease include those who have a positive family history (eg, a first- or second-degree relative), with an estimated prevalence of 5% to 20%,<sup>13</sup> and persons with other autoimmune diseases (eg, type 1 diabetes mellitus, inflammatory luminal gastrointestinal disorders, Down syndrome, Turner syndrome, IgA deficiency, and IgA nephropathy).<sup>14</sup> Several specialty societies recommend screening in these populations.<sup>15-17</sup> Reported prevalence among racial/ethnic minorities is lower than among non-Hispanic whites.<sup>2,5</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h4><em>Potential Harms</em></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Potential harms of screening for celiac disease in asymptomatic populations include false-positive, inconclusive, or unnecessary serologic test results and biopsies, with possible anxiety or complications from testing. Based on estimated likelihood ratios in the general population,<sup>2</sup> the positive predictive value of serologic testing for celiac disease is 12% to 40%, assuming a prevalence of approximately 1%. In a higher-risk population, the positive predictive value is 40% to 80%, depending on the serologic test used and whether the assumed prevalence is 5% or 10%. Some patients with positive serology findings who do not undergo histologic confirmation may make efforts to avoid dietary gluten, which can increase costs and burdens and may result in limitations on quality of life. Limited evidence from 5 long-term follow-up studies (3 studies of patients with positive serology findings; 2 studies of children with biopsy confirmation) has shown that some persons who are diagnosed with celiac disease may never develop symptoms or complications; thus, overdiagnosis is also a potential concern.<sup>10-12,18,19</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h4><em>Current Practice</em></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Reliable data on the frequency of screening for celiac disease in asymptomatic persons in clinical practice are not available.<sup>20</sup> It is not known how many patients with positive serology findings without biopsy confirmation are treated with a gluten-free diet.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Screening for celiac disease is typically not performed in average-risk persons.<sup>2</sup> The standard method of diagnosing celiac disease in symptomatic persons older than 2 years is the tissue transglutaminase (tTG) IgA test, followed by intestinal biopsy for histologic confirmation.<sup>2</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Treatment and Interventions</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Treatment of celiac disease is lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet, which reverses disease manifestations in a majority of patients.<sup>2</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Additional Approaches to Prevention</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases provides current, comprehensive, science-based information about the symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment of celiac disease.<sup>21</sup></p><h2>Other Considerations</h2><h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Studies that randomly assign participants to screening vs no screening and evaluate clinical outcomes are lacking. However, screening studies that target populations at increased risk for celiac disease are likely to be more informative than trials that target the general population, because of the higher prevalence of disease, and should be given higher priority. More information is needed about the accuracy of serologic testing in asymptomatic persons, particularly those with disease risk factors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treatment studies in screen-detected, asymptomatic persons are also needed to understand the effects of adherence to a gluten-free diet (compared with no dietary intervention), as well as the effects of immediate vs delayed dietary changes (ie, at the time of screen-detected diagnosis vs when symptoms develop). Ideally, studies would report both short-term effects on symptoms and quality of life and long-term outcomes (eg, osteoporotic fractures, cancer, and mortality). As for screening, treatment studies focused on asymptomatic persons at high risk for celiac disease who screen positive would be helpful for developing guidance for this population and may be faster and more efficient to complete than other study designs. More research is needed to better understand the natural history of positive serology in patients without histologic changes or with histologic confirmation but no symptoms. Also, treatment studies should report results stratified according to baseline histologic findings, given current uncertainty about the natural history of celiac disease in persons with mild histologic abnormalities.</p>","other":"<h2>Recommendations of Others</h2><p>The American Academy of Family Physicians has concluded that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for celiac disease in asymptomatic persons.<sup>28</sup> The American College of Gastroenterology recommends that asymptomatic persons with a first-degree relative who has a confirmed diagnosis of celiac disease be considered for testing. Patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus should be tested for celiac disease if there are any digestive symptoms, signs, or laboratory evidence suggestive of celiac disease.<sup>15</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommends offering serologic testing to persons with a first-degree relative with celiac disease or persons with type 1 diabetes mellitus or autoimmune thyroid disease on diagnosis. Serologic testing for celiac disease should be considered for persons with any of the following: metabolic bone disorder (reduced bone mineral density or osteomalacia), unexplained neurologic symptoms (particularly peripheral neuropathy or ataxia), unexplained subfertility or recurrent miscarriage, persistently elevated liver enzymes with unknown cause, dental enamel defects, Down syndrome, or Turner syndrome.<sup>16</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition recommends testing for celiac disease in asymptomatic children who have conditions associated with celiac disease (type 1 diabetes mellitus, autoimmune thyroiditis, Down syndrome, Turner syndrome, Williams syndrome, or selective IgA deficiency) or a first-degree relative with celiac disease. It recommends testing these children beginning around age 3 years, provided they have had an adequate gluten-containing diet for at least 1 year prior. It also recommends that asymptomatic, at-risk children with negative serology findings be considered for repeat testing.<sup>17</sup></p>","discussion":"<h2>Discussion</h2><h3>Burden of Disease</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Celiac disease is caused by an immune response in persons who are genetically susceptible to dietary gluten, a protein complex found in wheat, rye, and barley. Ingestion of gluten by persons with celiac disease causes immune-mediated inflammatory damage to the small intestine mucosa, resulting in malabsorption of nutrients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Celiac disease can have several different presentations. Classic celiac disease is associated with diarrhea, abdominal pain, and weight loss. However, celiac disease is also associated with nongastrointestinal, nonspecific manifestations of disease such as anemia, osteoporosis, chronic fatigue, peripheral neuropathy or ataxia, aphthous stomatitis, dermatitis herpetiformis, infertility, recurrent fetal loss, or short stature.<sup>3</sup> Children may also experience pubertal delay and dental enamel defects.<sup>22</sup> For patients with subclinical disease, symptoms may be mild and not recognized until after initiation of a gluten-free diet. Patients with silent, or asymptomatic, celiac disease have been diagnosed by serologic testing and intestinal biopsy but do not have the typical signs or symptoms of celiac disease. Patients with potential celiac disease have positive serology findings and mild or no intestinal damage on biopsy; they may or may not have symptoms. The natural history of silent and potential celiac disease is not well understood, and it is not clear if they represent progressive stages of celiac disease or distinct subtypes.<sup>2</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Data on the prevalence of silent celiac disease in the United States, as well as the proportion of these individuals who later develop symptomatic celiac disease, are limited.<sup>2</sup> Reported prevalence of celiac disease in the literature varies due to the different racial/ethnic populations studied and the method used to confirm diagnosis.<sup>2</sup> In a systematic review of 38 studies from North America and Western Europe, prevalence was similar among studies that included biopsy confirmation (0.15% to 1.90%) and among studies that did not (0.15% to 2.70%).<sup>1</sup> In the 3 US-based studies, prevalence among adults ranged from 0.40% to 0.95%.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on the accuracy of screening in asymptomatic adults, adolescents, and children; the potential benefits and harms of screening vs not screening, as well as targeted vs universal screening; and the benefits and harms of treatment of screen-detected celiac disease. For questions regarding the benefits and harms of screening and treatment, outcomes of interest included morbidity, mortality, and quality of life. The USPSTF also reviewed contextual information on the prevalence of celiac disease among patients without evident symptoms and the natural history of subclinical or silent celiac disease.<sup>2</sup> The USPSTF did not review the evidence on nonceliac gluten sensitivity because this condition is defined based on the presence of symptoms rather than diagnostic tests, and it is not thought to lead to the health complications associated with celiac disease.<sup>23</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening Tests</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A recent good-quality systematic review on the accuracy of diagnostic tests for celiac disease, which included studies enrolling both persons with symptoms and those whose symptom status was not described, found high strength of evidence that the tTG IgA test has high (&gt;90%) sensitivity and specificity and endomysial antibody (EMA) IgA tests have high specificity, based on consistent results from prior systematic reviews and new studies.<sup>24</sup> This systematic review included only 2 studies reporting diagnostic accuracy in asymptomatic persons at higher risk for celiac disease, due to other autoimmune disorders or family history, and no studies in asymptomatic persons at average risk. These 2 cross-sectional studies, which were both conducted outside the United States, found lower sensitivity and specificity for the tTG and EMA IgA tests (sensitivity, 57% to 71%; specificity, 83% to 98%), compared with studies that did not restrict enrollment to asymptomatic patients. One study was conducted in Iraq among patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, no symptoms of celiac disease, and no family history of celiac disease or thyroid disorders. Sensitivity was 71% for both the tTG and EMA IgA tests and specificity was 93% for the tTG test and 96% for the EMA IgA test.<sup>25</sup> The second study was conducted in the Czech Republic among children and adolescents at higher risk for celiac disease due to family history or a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus. Among asymptomatic patients, specificity and sensitivity of detecting antitransglutaminase levels of more than 10 times the upper limit of normal and a positive EMA IgA test result in patients with a Marsh histologic classification of stage 2 or 3 were 67% and 83%, respectively. Among first-degree relatives of patients with celiac disease (n=32), specificity was 70% and sensitivity was 81%. Among patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (n=40), specificity was 64% and sensitivity was 93%.<sup>26</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Early Detection or Treatment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no trials or controlled observational studies on the benefits of screening vs not screening or targeted vs universal screening in asymptomatic populations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no studies on the benefits of treatment of screen-detected celiac disease compared with treatment initiated after clinical diagnosis. The USPSTF found 1 small fair-quality trial on the benefits of treatment of screen-detected, asymptomatic adults compared with no treatment.<sup>27</sup> This study (n=40) reported that after 1 year, a gluten-free diet was associated with improvements in histopathologic findings and small improvements in 3 of 5 gastrointestinal symptoms that were statistically but not clinically significant (&lt;1 point on a 7-point scale). While there was also improvement in anxiety, no other measures of health-related quality of life showed improvements, and social functioning was worse in the group being treated with a gluten-free diet. After 2 years, more than 90% of participants in the intervention group reported adherence to the gluten-free diet, but there were no differences between the 2 groups in serology or subjective perception of health as measured by the visual analog scale.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Potential Harms of Screening or Treatment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no trials or controlled observational studies on the harms of screening for celiac disease in asymptomatic populations. Potential harms of screening include false-positive, inconclusive, or unnecessary serologic test results and biopsies, with possible anxiety or complications from testing. However, the USPSTF found no studies on these harms. A subset of patients with biopsy-confirmed celiac disease may never develop symptoms; therefore, overdiagnosis is also a potential concern.<sup>2</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One small fair-quality trial of treatment with a gluten-free diet<sup>27</sup>&nbsp; reported no withdrawals due to major symptoms or complications.

Recommendations regarding screening for iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women and iron supplementation during pregnancy are addressed in a separate recommendation statement (available at <a  href=\"https://uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/\">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>\r\n\r\n<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Estimates of the prevalence of iron deficiency in children ages 1 to 3 years in the United States range from 8% to 14%, and approximately one third of these children also have anemia.<sup>3</sup> Based on 1999 to 2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data, the estimated prevalence of iron deficiency anemia in children ages 12 to 35 months is 2.1%.<sup>1</sup> Several factors have been identified that may increase a child&rsquo;s risk for iron deficiency anemia, including prematurity or low birth weight, use of non&ndash;iron-fortified formula or introduction to cow&#39;s milk in the first year of life, and exclusive breastfeeding without regular intake of iron-fortified food after age 6 months. Demographic factors associated with increased risk for iron deficiency anemia include low socioeconomic status and having parents who are migrant workers or recent immigrants. Additional factors that may be associated with increased risk for iron deficiency in children include weight and height in the 95th percentile or greater, bottle feeding beyond the first year of life, having a mother who is currently pregnant, or living in an urban area. Evidence on whether Hispanic ethnicity increases children&#39;s risk for iron deficiency has been mixed, with some studies showing an increased risk and others showing no increased risk. Older data from NHANES (1988&ndash;1994) showed that Mexican American children were nearly 3 times more likely than white children to have iron deficiency, whereas more recent NHANES data from 1999&ndash;2002 found no increased risk in Hispanic children.<sup>3</sup> The USPSTF found no studies that assessed the performance of risk assessment tools to identify children who are at increased risk for iron deficiency anemia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some observational studies suggest that iron deficiency anemia in early childhood may be associated with neurodevelopmental and behavioral delays and poorer performance on cognitive tests. However, concluding that there is a direct causal link between iron deficiency anemia and these outcomes is difficult because of the methodological flaws in these studies and potential confounding due to underlying nutritional and socioeconomic differences between groups.<sup>3</sup> The aim of screening for iron deficiency anemia in young children is to identify and treat anemia before it leads to poor child health outcomes.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Potential Harms</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The harms of screening for iron deficiency anemia have not been well studied. Potential harms of screening include false-positive results, anxiety, and cost. Reported adverse events of treatment with iron include limited gastrointestinal symptoms, darkening color of stool, staining of teeth and gums, and drug interactions with other medications. The previous USPSTF recommendation also noted that accidental iron overdose can occur in children receiving treatment or supplementation with iron.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Current Practice</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>No recent nationally representative data on the current rate of screening are available.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the evidence is insufficient to recommend specific tests for screening, measurement of serum hemoglobin or hematocrit is often the first step.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Treatment and Interventions</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In the United States, iron deficiency anemia in children is usually treated with oral iron. The usual dose in infants and young children is 3 to 6 mg/kg of elemental iron per day in 2 to 3 divided doses.<sup>3</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Other Approaches to Prevention</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the Institute of Medicine, the Recommended Dietary Allowance for iron in infants ages 7 to 12 months is 11 mg per day. In children ages 1 to 3 years, the Recommended Dietary Allowance is 7 mg per day. Natural food sources of iron include certain fruits, vegetables, meat, and poultry. The Institute of Medicine also notes that nonheme iron, which is found in vegetarian diets, may be less well absorbed than heme iron, which is found in diets containing meat; therefore, the iron requirement may be almost twice as much in children who eat a purely vegetarian diet.<sup>4</sup> Fortified breads and grain products (such as cereal) are also good sources of iron for young children eating solid foods.<sup>5</sup> Iron-fortified formula is another source of iron for infants. Federally regulated iron fortification of food products in the United States began in 1941, and the iron content in enriched grain products has increased over the years.<sup>6</sup> More than 50% of the iron in the U.S. food supply comes from iron-fortified cereal grain products.<sup>5</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Useful Resources</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF has published a separate recommendation statement on screening for iron deficiency anemia and iron supplementation in pregnant women (available at <a  href=\"https://uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/\">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>).</p><h2>Other Considerations</h2><h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\n             \r\n             <p>Although iron deficiency anemia has been associated with neurodevelopmental and cognitive impairments and behavioral delays based on observational data, studies that show an improvement in these health  outcomes through treatment are lacking. Studies that evaluate the effects (short- and long-term) of change in iron status on health outcomes in settings similar to the United States with respect to nutrition, hemoparasite burden, and socioeconomic status are needed. Similarly, well-designed long-term, controlled studies that evaluate the benefits and harms of screening for and early treatment of asymptomatic iron deficiency anemia on health outcomes  (diagnosis of neurodevelopmental, cognitive, or behavioral disease rather than hematologic indexes) are needed.</p><h2>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h2><p>This recommendation is consistent with the 2006 recommendation statement on&nbsp; screening for iron deficiency anemia in children ages 6 to 12 months; however, this recommendation has been expanded to include children up to age 24 months. Both the 2006 and the current recommendation statement found insufficient evidence to determine the balance of benefits and harms of screening in young children. While the 2006 recommendation included a statement on supplementation in young children, the USPSTF has now determined that given the current widespread use of iron-fortified foods in the United States, including infant formulas and cereals, the impact of making a recommendation on physician-prescribed&nbsp; supplementation is likely limited. For this reason, the USPSTF decided to focus the current recommendation on screening only.</p>","other":"<h2>Recommendations of Others</h2><p>The Centers&nbsp; for Disease Control and Prevention recommends screening for iron deficiency anemia at ages 9 to 12 months, 6 months later, and then annually from ages 2 to 5 years in infants and preschool-age children who are at high risk for iron deficiency anemia.<sup>15</sup> The Institute of Medicine recommends screening at age 9 months in full-term infants who are breastfed or not receiving iron-fortified formula. It recommends screening by&nbsp; age 3 months in preterm infants who are not receiving iron-fortified formula. Only infants who are found to have anemia at one of these earlier screenings should be rescreened routinely at ages 15 to 18 months.<sup>16</sup> The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends universal screening for anemia at age 12 months and selective screening at any age in children who are at increased risk for iron deficiency or iron deficiency anemia.<sup>17</sup> Consistent with the USPSTF, the American Academy of Family Physicians concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess&nbsp; the balance of benefits and harms of screening for iron deficiency anemia in&nbsp; children ages 6 to 24 months.<sup>18</sup></p>","discussion":"<h2>Discussion</h2><h3>Burden of Disease</h3>\r\n             <p>Iron is necessary for the production of hemoglobin, an essential protein found in red blood cells. Iron deficiency occurs when body stores of iron become depleted. Iron deficiency can occur when there is an increased need for iron (e.g., during rapid growth in infants and toddlers) or when there is decreased iron intake and absorption (e.g., lack of iron sources in the diet). Iron deficiency anemia results when iron stores become so low that hemoglobin synthesis is impaired.</p>\r\n         \r\n             <p>Iron deficiency is the most common nutrient deficiency worldwide<sup>7</sup> and in the United  States.<sup>8, 9</sup> It represents approximately 40% of cases of anemia in the United States.<sup>1</sup> The estimated overall prevalence of iron deficiency anemia in the United States is 1% to 2% in children ages 1 to 5 years<sup>3</sup> and 2.1% in children ages 12 to 35 months.<sup>1</sup> Depending on the type of study used to estimate rates, the prevalence of iron deficiency in children ages 1 to 3 years  in the United States ranges from 8% to 14%.<sup>3</sup> </p>\r\n            \r\n             <p>The major concern about iron deficiency anemia in infants and young children is  whether it causes neurodevelopmental or behavioral delays or cognitive impairment. Few well-designed long-term studies on the effects of iron deficiency anemia in infancy and childhood on these health outcomes are available. Based primarily on observational data, studies have found an association between iron deficiency (with or without anemia) in infancy and childhood and impaired neurodevelopment in older children. Cognitive and behavioral delays in children have also been found to be associated with iron deficiency anemia. However, these observational studies have limitations due to the types of  measures reported and confounding with nutritional and socioeconomic factors, making causation difficult to determine.<sup>3</sup> </p>\r\n<h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n             \r\n             <p>The USPSTF commissioned a systematic review of the evidence to update its 2006 recommendation on screening for iron deficiency anemia. The current review assessed the evidence on young children ages 6 to 24 months. The USPSTF focused on reviewing the evidence on the association between change in iron status as a result of intervention and improvement in child health outcomes, as well as treatment of iron deficiency anemia with oral iron formulations. The USPSTF considered studies conducted in settings similar to the United States in rates of  malnutrition, hemoparasite burden, and general socioeconomic status. The focus of the current recommendation is on screening and prevention of iron deficiency anemia; however, findings on iron deficiency, as reported by individual studies,  also are provided for a better understanding of the potential burden in the U.S. population.</p>\r\n             \r\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening Tests</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Serum hemoglobin or hematocrit is the primary screening test for iron deficiency anemia. Hemoglobin is sensitive for  detecting iron deficiency anemia; however, it is not sensitive for detecting iron deficiency because mild deficiency states may not affect hemoglobin levels.<sup>3</sup> Hemoglobin is also nonspecific, as approximately 60% of cases of anemia result from causes other than iron deficiency.<sup>1</sup> The positive predictive value of low hemoglobin for iron deficiency in children age 12 months ranges from 10% to 40%.<sup>10</sup> In infants, particularly before age 12 months, iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia often resolve spontaneously, reducing the positive predictive value of any screening test. The sensitivity and specificity of other single tests (e.g., serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and erythrocyte protoporphyrin) as primary screening tools for iron deficiency anemia have not been well studied.<sup>11</sup> Serum ferritin, often  used to measure iron status, acts as an acute-phase reactant, so it should ideally be measured in the absence of infection or inflammation.<sup>3</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3> Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>No studies directly evaluated the effectiveness of screening for iron deficiency anemia in asymptomatic children  ages 6 to 24 months and reported on health outcomes. In addition, no new studies of oral iron treatment of iron deficiency anemia in this age group were found. The 2006 evidence review reported on older treatment trials that were  not included in this update because they were found to be of poor quality or were conducted in settings not applicable to the current U.S. population. In 2006, the USPSTF concluded that there was poor evidence (conflicting studies) of the effectiveness of interventions that demonstrate improved health outcomes, such as developmental status, in asymptomatic children. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>No studies applicable to the current U.S. population demonstrated an association between change in iron status as a result of intervention and improvement in child health outcomes. Indirect evidence from 2 studies of iron supplementation in iron-sufficient children found no difference in growth or developmental scale scores with changes in iron status.<sup>3</sup> </p>\r\n<h3>Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no new studies that reported on the harms of iron treatment in children ages 6 to 24 months. The 2006 review concluded that there was no evidence on the harms of treatment but noted that accidental iron overdose can occur in children receiving treatment or supplementation with iron. One older trial from 1991 that was not included in the previous review found no difference in overall or specific adverse events, including gastrointestinal  events.<sup>12</sup> </p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\n            <p>Overall, the USPSTF found insufficient evidence on screening for iron deficiency anemia in asymptomatic children ages 6 to 24 months. The USPSTF identified no studies that evaluated the benefits or harms of screening in this age group. Studies on the benefits and harms of treatment were generally older, conducted in settings not considered applicable to the current U.S. population, or of poor quality. The USPSTF did not find  sufficient evidence to determine the balance of benefits and harms of screening for iron deficiency anemia and thus cannot make a recommendation in favor of or  against screening. </p>\r\n            <h3>Response to  Public Comment</h3>\r\n            \r\n            <p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web site from March 31 to April 27, 2015. A few comments requested more information on which populations are at increased risk for iron deficiency anemia and to which population the recommendation applies. Existing language  describing risk factors for iron deficiency anemia and the target population for this recommendation was inserted earlier in the statement to make this information clearer. Some comments also requested separate analyses of certain high-risk populations. Although the USPSTF sought this information, limitations in the  evidence prevented it from performing separate analyses. A few comments noted that there was ambiguity in how the terms &ldquo;iron deficiency&rdquo; and &ldquo;iron deficiency anemia&rdquo; were used. The recommendation was reviewed to ensure  consistent use of each term and language was added to better explain that the focus of the recommendation is on iron deficiency anemia. </p>\r\n<h3>How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?</h3>\r\n\r\n            <p>Although associations have been reported between iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia and poorer neurodevelopmental measures, such as lower scores on intelligence or cognitive functioning tests, as well as behavioral delays, trials showing that treatment improves these outcomes are lacking. One oft-cited study conducted in Costa Rica reported on long-term developmental outcomes and found that compared with children who had good iron status as infants, children with chronic iron deficiency at ages 12 to 23 months who received treatment and had their anemia resolve within 3  months still scored lower on reading, writing, arithmetic, and motor tests at ages 11 to 14 years, as well as tests of cognitive function at age 19 years.<sup>13, 14</sup> This suggests that preventing iron  deficiency anemia may be preferable to treating it once it develops, or that perhaps other nutrients or factors may be mediating the association between iron deficiency anemia and cognitive function and may need to be addressed in addition to iron. </p>","topic":"Iron Deficiency Anemia in Young Children: Screening","keywords":"Iron|Anemia|Screening|Children","pubDate":"2015-09-07","categories":["4"],"tool":["144","145"]},"387":{"topicType":"Screening","topicYear":2018,"uspstfAlias":"ovarian-cancer-screening","specific":[400],"title":"Ovarian Cancer: Screening","rationale":"<h2>Rationale</h2><h3>Importance</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The age-adjusted incidence of ovarian cancer from 2010 to 2014 was 11.4 cases per 100,000 women per year.<sup>1</sup> Ovarian cancer is the fifth most common cause of cancer death among US women and the leading cause of death from gynecologic cancer, despite its low incidence.<sup>1</sup> Approximately 14,000 women die of ovarian cancer each year in the United States.

The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the psychological harms of screening for ovarian cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes that there is at least moderate certainty that the harms of screening for ovarian cancer outweigh the benefits.</p>","clinical":"<h2>Clinical Considerations</h2><h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This recommendation applies to asymptomatic women who are not known to have a high-risk hereditary cancer syndrome. A hereditary cancer syndrome occurs when a genetic mutation is passed from parent to child that increases risk for developing cancers or can cause earlier onset of cancers. Women who have a hereditary cancer syndrome that puts them at high risk for ovarian cancer are excluded from this recommendation.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Risk Assessment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Women with certain hereditary cancer syndromes are at high risk for ovarian cancer. For example, women with <em>BRCA1</em> or <em>BRCA2</em> genetic mutations associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer are at high risk for ovarian cancer. Numerous genetic mutations and hereditary cancer syndromes may be associated with ovarian cancer, each with a different constellation of associated cancers and family history pattern.<sup>3-5</sup> Women with a family history of ovarian or breast cancer may be at risk for a hereditary cancer syndrome and should discuss their family history with their health care professional. Management of a diagnosed hereditary cancer syndrome and prevention of ovarian cancer in these women is beyond the scope of this recommendation statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The clinical symptoms of ovarian cancer (eg, abdominal pain or pressure, bloating, constipation, urinary symptoms, back pain, or fatigue) are nonspecific and may be present in both healthy women and women with late-stage ovarian cancer; therefore, use of clinical symptoms for risk stratification for the early detection of disease is difficult.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF does not recommend routine screening for ovarian cancer using any method. Transvaginal ultrasound and serum CA-125 testing are readily available procedures that are commonly used to evaluate women with signs or symptoms of ovarian cancer, and both have been evaluated in screening studies. Pelvic examination is also commonly performed to evaluate women with lower abdominal symptoms, and although many clinicians perceive that pelvic examination with bimanual palpation of the ovaries is useful for screening for ovarian cancer,<sup>6</sup> there is a lack of evidence to support this.<sup>7</sup> Furthermore, the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial included bimanual palpation of the ovaries in its initial screening protocol, but this screening component was discontinued 5 years into the study because no cases of ovarian cancer were detected solely with bimanual palpation of the ovaries.<sup>8, 9</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The evaluation of abnormal test results consists of repeat testing with the same or a different test and often surgical removal (by laparoscopy or laparotomy) of 1 or both of the ovaries and fallopian tubes to determine whether a woman has ovarian cancer. Diagnostic guidelines recommend surgical removal of the complete ovary or ovaries, rather than tissue biopsy, to determine whether ovarian cancer is present.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Treatment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Treatment of ovarian cancer typically includes surgical treatment (staging or debulking) and intraperitoneal, intravenous, or combined chemotherapy.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Useful Resources</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In a separate recommendation statement, the USPSTF recommends that women with a family history indicating they are at risk for a deleterious gene mutation (<em>BRCA1</em> or <em>BRCA2</em>) be referred for genetic counseling and, if indicated, genetic testing.<sup>10</sup> The National Cancer Institute provides additional information on ovarian cancer risk and hereditary cancer syndromes.<sup>11</sup> The USPSTF also concluded in a separate recommendation statement that the current evidence was insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening with pelvic examination to detect a range of gynecologic conditions in asymptomatic, nonpregnant women.<sup>7</sup></p><h2>Other Considerations</h2><h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Given that most cases of ovarian cancer are diagnosed at later stages, when associated mortality is high, further research is needed to identify new screening strategies that could accurately detect ovarian cancer early, at a point when outcomes could be improved. There is a need for more sensitive and specific serologic tests, as well as better imaging techniques. Because of the potential for serious harms from diagnostic workup of positive screening results (ie, surgical removal of the ovary to determine whether ovarian cancer is present), new screening strategies should minimize false-positive results and be highly specific. In addition, studies evaluating the benefits and harms of these screening strategies in asymptomatic women not at high risk for ovarian cancer are needed. Study outcomes should include ovarian cancer mortality, quality of life, false-positive rate, surgery rate, surgical complication rate, and psychological harms. Further research is also needed on primary prevention of ovarian cancer.</p><h2>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h2><p>This recommendation statement is consistent with the 2012 USPSTF recommendation.<sup>21</sup> Since 2012, the large UKCTOCS trial was published, and much like the PLCO trial, it did not find that screening for ovarian cancer reduces ovarian cancer mortality in asymptomatic women not known to be at high risk for ovarian cancer.</p>","other":"<h2>Recommendations of Others</h2><p>There is consensus among major medical and public health organizations that screening for ovarian cancer in the general population is not recommended. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists does not recommend screening for ovarian cancer in low-risk, asymptomatic women; evaluation of high-risk women may include transvaginal ultrasound and CA-125 testing, in addition to physical examination.<sup>22</sup> The American Cancer Society states that there is no screening test proven to be effective and sufficiently accurate in the early detection of ovarian cancer and does not recommend screening for ovarian cancer in average-risk women.<sup>23</sup> The American College of Radiology does not recommend screening for ovarian cancer in average-risk women.<sup>24</sup> Consistent with the USPSTF, the American Academy of Family Physicians recommends against screening for ovarian cancer in asymptomatic women.<sup>25</sup> Although it is beyond the scope of the USPSTF recommendation, other organizations, such as the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, have issued guidelines for the prevention of ovarian cancer in women with hereditary cancer syndromes.<sup>26</sup></p>","discussion":"<h2>Discussion</h2><h3>Burden of Disease</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on United States Cancer Statistics data on invasive cancer rates from 2010 to 2014, the average annual age-adjusted incidence of ovarian cancer was 11.4 cases per 100,000 women per year, with a mortality rate of 7.4 deaths per 100,000 women.<sup>1</sup> In 2017, it is estimated that 22,440 new cases of ovarian cancer will have been diagnosed in the United States and 14,080 deaths will have occurred.<sup>12</sup> Early stages of the disease are often asymptomatic. Symptoms are usually nonspecific and can include abdominal pain or pressure, bloating, constipation, urinary symptoms, back pain, or fatigue.<sup>13</sup> The majority of women (88%) diagnosed with ovarian cancer are 45 years and older, with a median age at diagnosis of 63 years.<sup>2</sup> Most women with ovarian cancer are diagnosed at later stages; approximately 60% of women have distant spread of disease at the time of diagnosis.<sup>2</sup> From 2010 to 2014, white women had the highest age-adjusted incidence rate (11.8 cases per 100,000 women), followed by Hispanic women (10.3 cases per 100,000 women), black women (9.2 cases per 100,000 women), Asian/Pacific Islander women (9.1 cases per 100,000 women), and American Indian/Alaska Native women (8.3 cases per 100,000 women). White women are most likely to die of ovarian cancer, followed by black, Hispanic, American Indian/Alaska Native women, and Asian/Pacific Islander women.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mortality rates from ovarian cancer vary by stage at diagnosis; 5-year survival rates range from 92.5% for localized cancer to 28.9% for cancer with distant spread.<sup>14</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF commissioned a review of the evidence on screening for ovarian cancer to update its 2012 recommendation. The evidence review evaluated the benefits and harms of screening for ovarian cancer in asymptomatic women not known to be at high risk for ovarian cancer. Outcomes of interest included ovarian cancer mortality, quality of life, false-positive rate, surgery and surgical complication rates, and psychological effects of screening. The USPSTF included primary peritoneal cancer in its ascertainment of ovarian cancer outcomes, even if it was not the primary end point of the study, because clinically, both types of cancer are diagnosed and treated as 1 disease. The USPSTF also considered ascertainment of ovarian cancer outcomes that included both incident and prevalent cases of cancer, since screening programs would detect both. The review included any screening approach evaluated by clinical trial design. The USPSTF considered the initial screening test (eg, transvaginal ultrasound or CA-125 testing interpreted using a single cutoff or the risk of ovarian cancer algorithm [ROCA; Abcodia Inc]) as the screening intervention. Further testing that subsequently occurred based on initial screening test results was considered follow-up testing and evaluation, rather than part of screening.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Screening</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed direct evidence evaluating the benefits of screening for ovarian cancer on mortality.<sup>3</sup> The USPSTF identified 3 good-quality studies evaluating the effect of annual screening in asymptomatic women not known to be at high risk for ovarian cancer. None of the studies found that screening significantly reduced ovarian cancer mortality. The largest and most recent trial, the UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS), was a randomized clinical trial of 202,638 postmenopausal women aged 50 to 74 years not known to be at high risk for ovarian cancer.<sup>15</sup> More than 95% of trial participants were white, and 1.6% reported a maternal history of ovarian cancer and 6.4% reported a maternal history of breast cancer; however, women with a family history considered &ldquo;high risk&rdquo; for familial ovarian cancer were explicitly excluded.<sup>16</sup> The UKCTOCS trial had 2 intervention groups and a no-screening control group. Women were randomized to screening with CA-125 serum testing, with triage and follow-up determined by ROCA, or to yearly transvaginal ultrasound. The CA-125 ROCA screening intervention group was described as multimodal screening in the trial publications and included a standard protocol for all additional evaluation. ROCA evaluates changes in CA-125 values over time, following a baseline age-adjusted measurement. Women randomized to the control group received no screening. After a median follow-up of 11.1 years, ovarian cancer mortality (which includes mortality from primary peritoneal and fallopian tube cancer) was not significantly different among the control group and 2 intervention groupss (0.35% in the control group, 0.32% in the transvaginal ultrasound group, and 0.32% in the CA-125 ROCA group). There was also no significant difference in mortality risk in the transvaginal ultrasound and CA-125 ROCA groups (hazard ratio, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.76 to 1.09] and 0.89 [95% CI, 0.74 to 1.08], respectively).<sup>3, 15</sup> Exploratory analyses of UKCTOCS trial data suggest the potential for emergence of a delayed mortality benefit of screening appearing beyond 10 years from randomization. However, this finding was not statistically significant unless cases of primary peritoneal cancer were excluded. Extended follow-up data may help clarify this potential finding in the future; however, given the aggressive nature (ie, low 5-year survival rate) of ovarian cancer, the mechanism behind a delayed benefit from screening and early detection would be unclear, especially because the trial discontinued screening after 7 to 11 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The pilot trial for the UKCTOCS trial, UK Pilot, was much smaller (n = 21,955 randomized). It evaluated the use of a single cutoff value for CA-125 testing and found no significant difference in ovarian cancer mortality (excluding cases of primary peritoneal cancer, which were not reported) between women who were screened vs not screened (0.08% vs 0.16%; relative risk, 0.5 [95% CI, 0.22 to 1.11]).<sup>3, 17</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only trial conducted in the United States was the PLCO trial. In that trial, 68,557 women who had at least 1 ovary at baseline were randomized to either annual screening (both CA-125 testing and transvaginal ultrasound for the first 4 rounds of screening, then 2 rounds of CA-125 testing only) or usual care; median follow-up was 12.4 years. Eligible participants were women aged 55 to 74 years without a previous diagnosis of lung, colorectal, or ovarian cancer. Trial recruitment targeted women from the general population; the trial did not actively exclude women based on risk for hereditary ovarian cancer syndromes (based on reported family history), and 17.4% of participants reported a family history of ovarian or breast cancer. Nearly 90% of participants were white. Abnormal test results were managed by the participant&#39;s personal health care practitioner. No difference was found in ovarian cancer mortality, which includes primary peritoneal cancer mortality, with 0.34% in the screening group and 0.29% in the usual care group (relative risk, 1.18 [95% CI, 0.82 to 1.71]).<sup>3, 8</sup> Recent analyses of PLCO trial data that add up to 6 more years of posttrial mortality data also did not find evidence of a longer-term benefit of screening.<sup>18</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Potential Harms of Screening</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed evidence on harms of screening for ovarian cancer from the 3 studies described above, as well as a fourth study of fair quality reporting on quality of life and psychological harms of screening (Quality of life, Education, and Screening Trial [QUEST]) (n = 549 analyzed).<sup>19</sup> Based on data from the 3 studies, the calculated false-positive rates (ie, the number of women without cancer who had a positive screening test result) were 11.9% in the first screening round in the UKCTOCS transvaginal ultrasound group and 9.0% in the first screening round in the UKCTOCS CA-125 ROCA group.<sup>3</sup> These rates exclude cases of primary peritoneal cancer because this information was not reported. Cumulatively, in all subsequent screening rounds (ie, rounds 2 to 11) in the UKCTOCS CA-125 ROCA group, 44.2% of women who did not have ovarian cancer (including primary peritoneal cancer) had a positive CA-125 ROCA result at some point during the trial screening period.<sup>3</sup> The false-positive rate for subsequent screening rounds in the UKCTOCS transvaginal ultrasound group was not reported. In the UK Pilot trial, the calculated false-positive rate (excluding cases of primary peritoneal cancer, which were not reported) of CA-125 testing using a single cutoff value was 4.2% across 3 screening rounds. In the PLCO trial, the calculated false-positive rate (including cases of primary peritoneal cancer) of transvaginal ultrasound and CA-125 testing was 9.6% across all 6 screening rounds.<sup>3</sup> Surgery to investigate positive screening test results among women who ultimately did not have ovarian cancer occurred in 0.2% of participants in the UK Pilot CA-125 group, 0.97% of participants in the UKCTOCS CA-125 ROCA group, 3.25% of participants in the UKCTOCS ultrasound group, and 3.17% of participants in the PLCO CA-125 plus ultrasound group.<sup>3</sup> Up to 15% of these women had major surgical complications.<sup>3</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF identified limited evidence on the psychological harms of screening for ovarian cancer from the UKCTOCS and QUEST trials.<sup>3, 19, 20</sup> The UKCTOCS trial measured anxiety in a subgroup of participants. Although no significant differences were found between the intervention and control groups, there was a greater odds of psychological morbidity among women who were referred to higher levels of screening.<sup>20</sup> The QUEST trial evaluated the effect of screening for ovarian cancer on cancer worry and quality of life among average-risk US women 30 years and older. Cancer screening consisted of alternating CA-125 testing and transvaginal ultrasound every 6 months, for a maximum of 4 screening rounds. Although no statistically significant difference in cancer worry was found between study groups, the trial found that women with abnormal test results were more likely to report cancer worry at 2 years of follow-up (odds ratio, 2.8 [95% CI, 1.1 to 7.2]) than women without abnormal results.<sup>19</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that screening for ovarian cancer does not reduce ovarian cancer mortality. Three large good-quality studies all found no benefit in ovarian cancer mortality from annual screening in asymptomatic women not known to be at high risk for ovarian cancer. The USPSTF also found adequate evidence from these 3 studies that the harms from screening for ovarian cancer are at least moderate and may be substantial in some cases. Harms from screening for ovarian cancer include false-positive results, which may lead to unnecessary diagnostic surgery to determine whether ovarian cancer is present, often resulting in removal of 1 or both of the ovaries and fallopian tubes. Serious surgical complications can also result. The USPSTF found the evidence on psychological harms of screening to be inadequate and could not draw any definitive conclusion on whether ovarian cancer screening causes psychological harms. Given the lack of mortality benefit of screening, and the moderate to substantial harms that could result from false-positive screening test results and subsequent surgery, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the harms of screening for ovarian cancer with CA-125 testing (using a single cutoff value or the ROCA), transvaginal ultrasound, or both outweigh the benefit, and the net balance of the benefit and harms of screening is negative.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from July 18, 2017, to August 14, 2017. Many comments voiced concern that given the aggressive nature of ovarian cancer and that symptoms often only appear at later stages, any screening test that can detect ovarian cancer early should be recommended. The USPSTF agrees that screening tests are needed that can accurately detect ovarian cancer earlier to prevent deaths from ovarian cancer; however, the evidence shows that currently available tests are not able to do so and can lead to harm by causing healthy women to undergo surgical removal of their ovaries when no cancer is present. The USPSTF issued its recommendation against screening based on this evidence, not on the costs of screening. Additional comments sought clarification on which women are at high risk for ovarian cancer and to whom the recommendation applies. The USPSTF revised the recommendation statement to clarify the role of family history in ovarian cancer risk and to describe symptoms of ovarian cancer. Women with a family history of ovarian or breast cancer or symptoms should discuss this with their health care provider. The USPSTF also provided more information on how it considered evidence from specific studies. The USPSTF considered study results that included cases of primary peritoneal cancer in the ascertainment of ovarian cancer because clinically, both types of cancer are diagnosed and treated as 1 disease. Similarly, the USPSTF considered study results that included reporting of both prevalent and incident cases of ovarian cancer, because screening would detect both.</p>","topic":"Ovarian Cancer: Screening","keywords":"Ovarian Cancer","pubDate":"2018-02-13","categories":["3"],"tool":["148","150","149"]},"389":{"topicType":"Screening","topicYear":2018,"uspstfAlias":"cervical-cancer-screening","specific":[426,427,429,428],"title":"Cervical Cancer: Screening","rationale":"<h2>Rationale</h2><h3 align=\"left\">Importance</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The number of deaths from cervical cancer in the United States have decreased substantially since the implementation of widespread cervical cancer screening and continue to decline, from 2.8 per 100,000 women in 2000 to 2.3 deaths per 100,000 women in 2015.<sup>1</sup> Most cases of cervical cancer occur among women who have not been adequately screened.<sup>2</sup> Strategies that aim to ensure that all women are appropriately screened and receive adequate follow-up are most likely to succeed in further reducing cervical cancer incidence and mortality in the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Detection</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found convincing evidence that screening with cervical cytology alone, primary testing for high-risk HPV types (hrHPV testing) alone, or in combination at the same time (cotesting) can detect high-grade precancerous cervical lesions and cervical cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">USPSTF Assessment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes with high certainty that the benefits of screening every 3 years with cytology alone in women aged 21 to 29 years substantially outweigh the harms.

This recommendation statement does not apply to women who have been diagnosed with a high-grade precancerous cervical lesion or cervical cancer, women with in utero exposure to diethylstilbestrol, or women who have a compromised immune system (eg, women living with HIV).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Assessment of Risk</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>High-risk HPV infection is associated with nearly all cases of cervical cancer, and women are exposed to hrHPV through sexual intercourse. Although a large proportion of HPV infections resolve spontaneously, the high likelihood of exposure to hrHPV means that women are at risk for precancerous lesions and cervical cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Certain risk factors increase risk for cervical cancer, including HIV infection, a compromised immune system, in utero exposure to diethylstilbestrol, and previous treatment of a high-grade precancerous lesion or cervical cancer. Women with these risk factors are not included in this recommendation and should receive individualized follow-up. Women who have had a hysterectomy with removal of the cervix and do not have a history of a high-grade precancerous lesion or cervical cancer are not at risk for cervical cancer and should not be screened. As part of the clinical evaluation, clinicians should confirm through review of surgical records or direct examination that the cervix was removed.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Screening Tests</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Current evidence indicates that there are no clinically important differences between liquid-based cytology and conventional cytology. A variety of platforms are used to detect hrHPV; most use either signal or nucleic acid amplification methods. Published trials of hrHPV testing used in situ hybridization, polymerase chain reaction, and hybrid capture technology to test for HPV strains associated with cervical cancer. hrHPV testing has been used for primary screening, cotesting with cytology, and follow-up testing of positive cytology results (reflex hrHPV).<sup>2</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Screening with cytology alone, hrHPV testing alone, and both in combination offer a reasonable balance between benefits and harms for women aged 30 to 65 years; women in this age group should discuss with their health care professional which testing strategy is best for them. Evidence from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and decision modeling studies suggest that screening with cytology alone is slightly less sensitive for detecting CIN 2 and CIN 3 than screening with hrHPV testing alone. Although screening with hrHPV testing alone or in combination with cytology detects more cases of CIN 2 and CIN 3, this method results in more diagnostic colposcopies for each case detected.<sup>2-5</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are a number of different protocols for triage of abnormal results from screening with cytology, hrHPV testing, or cotesting. Clinical trial evidence and modeling suggest that different triage protocols have generally similar detection rates for CIN 2 and CIN 3; however, proceeding directly to diagnostic colposcopy without additional triage leads to a much greater number of colposcopies compared with using other triage protocols. Maintaining comparable benefits and harms of screening with cytology alone or hrHPV testing alone requires that patients, clinicians, and health care organizations adhere to currently recommended protocols for repeat testing, diagnostic colposcopy, and treatment.<sup>6,7</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Timing of Screening</h3>\r\n\r\n<h4 align=\"left\">Women Younger Than 21 Years</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Cervical cancer is rare before age 21 years.<sup>8</sup> Exposure of cervical cells to hrHPV during vaginal intercourse may lead to cervical carcinogenesis, but the process has multiple steps, involves regression, and is generally not rapid. Because of the slow progression of disease and the high likelihood of regression in this age group, evidence suggests that screening earlier than age 21 years, regardless of sexual history, would lead to more harm than benefit. Treatment of CIN 2 or CIN 3 among women younger than 21 years may increase risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes.<sup>2,8</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h4 align=\"left\">Women Older Than 65 Years</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Joint guidelines from the American Cancer Society, American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology, and American Society for Clinical Pathology (ACS/ASCCP/ASCP) define adequate prior screening as 3 consecutive negative cytology results or 2 consecutive negative cotesting results within 10 years before stopping screening, with the most recent test occurring within 5 years.<sup>6</sup> The guidelines further state that routine screening should continue for at least 20 years after spontaneous regression or appropriate management of a precancerous lesion, even if this extends screening past age 65 years. Once screening has stopped, it should not resume in women older than 65 years, even if they report having a new sexual partner.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4 align=\"left\">Women Older Than 65 Years Who Have Not Been Adequately Screened</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Screening may be clinically indicated in older women with an inadequate or unknown screening history. Recent data suggest that one-fourth of women aged 45 to 64 years have not been screened for cervical cancer in the preceding 3 years.<sup>9</sup> In particular, women with limited access to care, women from racial/ethnic minority groups, and women from countries where screening is not available may be less likely to meet criteria for adequate prior screening. Certain considerations may also support screening in women older than 65 years who are otherwise at high risk (ie, women with a history of high-grade precancerous lesions or cervical cancer, in utero exposure to diethylstilbestrol, or a compromised immune system).<sup>2</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Screening Interval</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Screening more frequently than every 3 years with cytology alone confers little additional benefit, with a large increase in harms, including additional procedures and assessment and treatment of transient lesions. Treatment of lesions that would otherwise resolve on their own is harmful because it can lead to procedures with unwanted adverse effects, including the potential for cervical incompetence and preterm labor during pregnancy. Evidence from RCTs, observational studies, and modeling studies suggest that a 5-year screening interval for primary hrHPV testing alone or cotesting offers the best balance of benefits and harms. Screening more frequently than every 5 years with primary hrHPV testing alone or cotesting does not substantially improve benefit but significantly increases the number of screening tests and colposcopies.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Treatment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Screening aims to identify high-grade precancerous cervical lesions to prevent progression to cervical cancer. High-grade cervical lesions may be treated with excisional and ablative therapies. Early-stage cervical cancer may be treated with surgery (hysterectomy) or chemotherapy. Treatment of precancerous lesions is less invasive than treatment of cancer.<sup>2</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Race/Ethnicity, Geography, and Cervical Cancer</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The incidence of and mortality from cervical cancer remain relatively high among certain populations. The overall mortality rate from cervical cancer among African American women is 10.1 deaths per 100,000 women,<sup>10</sup> which is more than twice the rate among white women (when adjusted for hysterectomy rate), although the gap has narrowed over time. Mortality is higher among older African American women. Several studies have found that African American women are screened for cervical cancer at rates similar to those for white women and that inadequate follow-up after screening and differences in treatment may be important contributing factors. The higher mortality rate in African American women may also be attributable, in part, to the higher than average rate of adenocarcinoma, which carries a worse prognosis than the most common type of cervical cancer (squamous cell carcinoma).<sup>10-12</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>American Indian/Alaska Native women also have higher rates of cervical cancer mortality (3.2 deaths per 100,000 women) than the US average.<sup>10</sup> Factors driving this higher rate may include lower screening rates (16.5% of American Indian/Alaska Native women in the 2012 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System reported not receiving a Papanicolaou [Pap] test in the past 5 years)<sup>13</sup> and inadequate follow-up.<sup>2</sup> Hispanic women have a significantly higher incidence rate of cervical cancer and slightly higher mortality rate (2.6 deaths per 100,000 women [unadjusted for hysterectomy rate]), with especially high rates occurring along the Texas-Mexico border. Although white women overall have the lowest mortality rate from cervical cancer, white women living in geographically isolated and medically underserved areas (particularly Appalachia) have much higher mortality rates than the US average. Asian women also have lower screening rates, especially those who have recently immigrated to the United States and may have language or cultural barriers to screening.<sup>10</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to race/ethnicity and geography, insurance coverage plays an important role in access to cervical cancer screening; 23.1% of women without health insurance and 25.5% of women with no regular health care clinician reported not receiving a Pap test in the past 5 years, compared with 11.4% of the general population. Insurance status may interact with other demographic factors, such as race/ethnicity and age, to increase disparities.<sup>13</sup> In addition, there are no screening data for women with disabilities and those who identify as lesbian or transgender.<sup>14-16</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Progress in reducing cervical cancer incidence and mortality has been uneven. The most important factors contributing to higher incidence and mortality rates include financial, geographic, and language or cultural barriers to screening; barriers to follow-up; unequal treatment; and difference in cancer types, all of which vary across subpopulations.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Additional Approaches to Prevention</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&rsquo;s Advisory Council on Immunization Practice recommends routine HPV vaccination. A 2-dose schedule is recommended for girls and boys who initiate the vaccination series at ages 9 to 14 years. Three doses are recommended for girls and boys who initiate the vaccination series at ages 15 to 26 years and for those who have a compromised immune system.<sup>17</sup> The overall effect of HPV vaccination on high-grade precancerous cervical lesions and cervical cancer is not yet known. Current trials have not yet provided data on long-term efficacy; therefore, the possibility that vaccination might reduce the need for screening with cytology or hrHPV testing is not established. Given these uncertainties, women who have been vaccinated should continue to be screened as recommended until further evidence accrues.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Useful Resources</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The 2012 ACS/ASCCP/ASCP guidelines<sup>6</sup> and 2015 interim guidance from the ASCCP and the Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO)<sup>7</sup> provide algorithms for follow-up of abnormal screening results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, and the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America have issued recommendations on screening for and management of cervical cancer in patients living with HIV.<sup>18</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The National Cancer Institute provides strategies for reducing cervical cancer mortality in its report &ldquo;Excess Cervical Cancer Mortality: A Marker for Low Access to Health Care in Poor Communities.&rdquo;<sup>19</sup></p><h2>Other Considerations</h2><h3 align=\"left\">Implementation</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Participation in regular screening has a far greater effect on cervical cancer morbidity and mortality than which of the 3 recommended screening strategies is chosen for women ages 30 to 65 years. Implementation should therefore focus on ensuring that women receive adequate screening, regardless of which strategy is used.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although low screening rates contribute to high mortality rates in certain underserved populations, screening alone is not sufficient to reduce cervical cancer morbidity and mortality and related disparities. Loss to follow-up and disparities in treatment are also contributing factors. Therefore, having systems in place to ensure follow-up of abnormal results, appropriate treatment of any pathology, and support to retain patients throughout the entirety of cancer treatment are important.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Regular screening for prevention of cervical cancer is highly effective, whether it is with cervical cytology alone, hrHPV testing alone, or both in combination. To further reduce the incidence and mortality of cervical cancer, it is necessary to find effective strategies to reach inadequately screened and unscreened women and to address follow-up and treatment issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Research is needed to evaluate whether different screening strategies could play a part in reducing mortality rates, as well as ways to improve follow-up for current screening strategies and to ensure equitable access to treatment across populations. In addition, research is needed to determine whether screening after age 65 years has a different balance of benefits and harms in different subpopulations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unlike cytology, samples for hrHPV testing have the potential to be collected by the patient and mailed to health programs for analysis, meaning self-collection may be one strategy for increasing screening rates among populations where they are currently low. Rigorous comparative studies are needed to verify this hypothesis and to identify effective strategies for implementation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another important area for future research is the effect of HPV vaccination, because an increasing number of women and men of screening age are being vaccinated. Decreases in hrHPV type prevalence due to vaccination could reduce the positive predictive value of hrHPV testing, which, along with potential reductions in cancer incidence, may increase the number of false-positive results and, therefore, the balance of benefits and harms. In either case, screening strategies may need to be adjusted.</p><h2>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h2><p>This recommendation replaces the 2012 USPSTF recommendation. The major change in the current recommendation is that the USPSTF now recommends screening every 5 years with hrHPV testing alone as an alternative to screening every 3 years with cytology alone among women aged 30 to 65 years. These are the 2 preferred screening strategies based on the USPSTF review of trial, cohort, and modeling results. Cotesting as an alternative strategy has demonstrated similar effectiveness, although it may result in more tests and procedures compared with either cytology or hrHPV testing alone. As in the 2012 recommendation, the USPSTF continues to recommend against screening in women younger than 21 years, in women older than 65 years who have had adequate prior screening and are not otherwise at high risk for cervical cancer, and in women who have had a hysterectomy with removal of the cervix and do not have a history of a high-grade precancerous lesion or cervical cancer.</p>","other":"<h2>Recommendations of Others</h2><p>The ACS/ASCCP/ASCP recommend that women aged 21 to 29 years be screened every 3 years with cytology alone (cervical cytology or Pap testing). Women aged 30 to 65 years should be screened every 5 years with cytology and HPV testing (cotesting) or every 3 years with cytology alone. Women at increased risk of cervical cancer (ie, women with a history of cervical cancer, a compromised immune system, or diethylstilbestrol exposure) may need to be screened more often. Women who have had CIN 2+ should continue screening for 20 years after the last abnormal test result, even if it extends screening beyond age 65 years.<sup>6</sup> The ASCCP and SGO issued interim guidance in 2015 that recommended primary HPV screening starting at age 25 years as an alternative to cytology alone or cotesting.<sup>7</sup> The American Academy of Family Physicians guidelines are in agreement with the USPSTF.<sup>65</sup> The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists stated in 2016 that cytology alone and cotesting are still specifically recommended in current guidelines from most major societies; however, primary HPV screening in women 25 years or older can be considered as an alternative to current cytology-based screening if performed per ASCCP and SGO interim guidance.<sup>66</sup> The Panel on Opportunistic Infections in HIV-Infected Adults and Adolescents has issued guidance on screening for and management of HPV in patients living with HIV.<sup>18</sup></p>","discussion":"<h2>Discussion</h2><h3 align=\"left\">Burden of Disease</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Cervical cancer incidence and mortality have decreased significantly since the 1960s because of widespread screening.<sup>2</sup> In 2018, an estimated 13,240 new cases and 4,170 deaths will occur, making cervical cancer the 18th most common cause of cancer death in the United States.<sup>20</sup> Most cases of cervical cancer and related deaths occur among women who have not been adequately screened, followed up, or treated.<sup>2</sup> In 2013, 81.7% of women aged 21 to 44 years and 79.2% of women aged 45 to 64 years reported receiving a Pap test in the past 3 years, as recommended.<sup>9</sup> While this is a much higher coverage rate than that of many other cancer screening programs, it still falls short of the Healthy People 2020 goal of screening 93% of women aged 21 to 65 years.<sup>21</sup> Further, the burden of cervical cancer incidence and mortality falls disproportionately on racial/ethnic and sexual/gender minority groups, persons with disabilities, and low-income and geographically defined populations.<sup>10</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Scope of Review</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF commissioned a review of the evidence<sup>2,4</sup> on screening for cervical cancer to update its 2012 recommendation.<sup>22</sup> The review focused on outcomes from trials and cohort studies in high-resource countries that evaluated screening with hrHPV testing alone or hrHPV and cytology together (cotesting) compared with cervical cytology alone. The review did not examine data on test accuracy or the effectiveness of cytology for screening for cervical cancer, as both were established in the previous evidence review.<sup>23</sup> Similarly, the review did not systematically examine data for women younger than 21 years or for women who have had a hysterectomy with removal of the cervix except to confirm that the evidence has not changed since the previous review.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to the systematic evidence review, the USPSTF commissioned a decision analysis model<sup>3,5</sup> to evaluate the age at which to begin and end screening, the optimal interval for screening, the effectiveness of different screening strategies, and how these factors affect the relative benefits and harms of different screening strategies. The USPSTF approach to the use of model-based analysis as a complement to systematic evidence reviews is described in detail elsewhere.<sup>24</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Accuracy of Screening Tests</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Evidence from RCTs indicates that hrHPV testing and cotesting can detect more cases of CIN 3, but they also have higher false-positive rates compared with cytology alone. Cotesting has the highest false-positive rate. False-positive rates are also higher among women younger than 30 years than among older women because of the higher incidence of transient HPV infection in younger women, even though cervical cancer incidence is lower in this age group.<sup>2</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Estimates of sensitivity and specificity of any screening strategy are heavily influenced by the follow-up of abnormal results, and follow-up protocols in cervical cancer screening trials varied widely.<sup>2</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Effectiveness of Different Screening Strategies</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The reduction of mortality and morbidity associated with the introduction of cytology-based screening is consistent across populations. A cluster RCT conducted in India found a nearly 50% reduction in cervical cancer mortality after a single round of hrHPV testing compared with a nonscreened control group after 8 years of follow-up.<sup>25</sup> The evidence review did not address whether screening for cervical cancer is effective but rather which screening strategies are most effective, when to start screening, and when to stop screening.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4 align=\"left\">Women Younger Than 21 Years</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF considered the following types of evidence to determine when screening for cervical cancer should begin: cervical cancer incidence, prevalence, and mortality among young women; the natural history of precancerous lesions and HPV infection; and the effects of screening in populations of young women. Cervical cancer is rare among women younger than 20 years; according to US Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data, 0.1% of all incident cancer cases occur in this age group.<sup>1</sup> Precancerous lesions are also uncommon. Estimated prevalence of CIN 3 among women younger than 20 years is 0.2%, with a concurrent false-positive cytology rate of about 3.1%.<sup>26</sup> In addition, the decision analysis model commissioned for the 2012 USPSTF recommendation showed no net benefit to starting screening before age 21 years.<sup>27</sup> The USPSTF did not look at evidence for women younger than 21 years living with HIV or who are otherwise at higher risk of cervical cancer, as they are outside the scope of this recommendation.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4 align=\"left\">Women Aged 21 to 29 Years</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF recommends screening for cervical cancer every 3 years with cervical cytology alone in women aged 21 to 29 years. Given the high prevalence of transient HPV infection among adolescents and young adults, initial screening at age 21 years should be with cytology alone. The question of what age at which screening with hrHPV testing alone offers comparable benefit has not been directly studied. The 4 trials that compared screening with hrHPV testing alone vs cytology alone found a consistently higher detection rate among younger women (younger than 30 or 35 years), which raises concern for overdiagnosis and overtreatment of transient infection.<sup>28-31</sup> Modeling estimates of the effects of switching from screening with cytology alone to hrHPV testing alone at ages 25, 27, and 30 years found minimal differences in terms of life-years gained compared with switching screening strategies at age 30 vs 25 years (64,193 vs 64,195 life-years gained per 1000 women screened, respectively). However, screening with hrHPV testing alone starting at age 25 years rather than age 30 years increased the number of colposcopies by nearly 400 colposcopies per 1000 women screened.<sup>3</sup> Therefore, switching from cytology alone to hrHPV testing alone at age 30 years appears to offer similar benefits in terms of cancer reduction as switching at younger ages but with fewer associated tests and procedures.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4 align=\"left\">Women Aged 30 to 65 Years</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found 8 trials of cervical cancer screening; 4 RCTs compared screening with hrHPV testing alone vs cytology alone and 4 RCTs compared screening with cytology alone vs cotesting (cytology in combination with hrHPV testing).<sup>2</sup> No trials directly compared screening strategies using hrHPV testing alone vs cotesting. Meta-analysis was not possible because the trials varied substantially in terms of cytology type (conventional vs liquid-based), hrHPV test (polymerase chain reaction vs hybrid capture), screening interval (2 to 5 years), follow-up protocols for abnormal results, and protocols for screening beyond the first round. No trial included more than 2 rounds of screening. Although the purpose of screening is to reduce cervical cancer mortality, the mortality rate is so low in countries that have organized cytology screening programs that it is impractical to directly measure the effects of different screening strategies on mortality through clinical trials. Therefore, trials measured the rate of CIN 3+ (CIN 3 or worse) detection, and some trials also reported the rate of invasive cervical cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4 align=\"left\">hrHPV Testing Alone vs Conventional Cytology Alone</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Four RCTs (N &gt; 250,000 women) compared screening with hrHPV testing alone vs cytology alone: the New Technologies for Cervical Cancer (NTCC) Phase II trial in Italy,<sup>28,32-34</sup> the HPV for Cervical Cancer Screening (HPV FOCAL) trial in Canada,<sup>29</sup> the FINNISH trial in Finland,<sup>30</sup> and the Compass trial in Australia.<sup>31</sup> Overall, the 4 trials found that hrHPV testing alone led to an increase in the rate of CIN 3+ detection compared with cytology alone in the first round of screening. The NTCC Phase II and HPV FOCAL trials enrolled women aged 25 to 60 or 65 years and had 2 rounds of screening 2 to 4 years apart. The FINNISH trial, which enrolled women aged 25 to 65 years, had a single round of screening and then followed up participants for 5 years through a cancer registry. The Compass trial, which enrolled 4995 women aged 25 to 64 years, randomized participants to liquid-based cytology every 2.5 years or hrHPV primary screening every 5 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The NTCC Phase II trial found that hrHPV testing alone had a cumulative CIN 3+ detection rate twice that of cytology alone (0.4% vs 0.2%). The FINNISH trial measured the rate of invasive cervical cancer detection at 5 years; screening with hrHPV testing alone had a detection rate of 0.03% and screening with cytology alone had a detection rate of 0.01%. Recently published results from the HPV FOCAL trial<sup>35</sup> found that hrHPV testing alone had a higher detection rate for CIN 3+ (0.7%) compared with cytology (0.4%) after 4 years of follow-up. The Compass trial reported preliminary results consistent with those from the other 3 trials, but final results at 5 years of follow-up have not yet been published.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The primary harms measured in the RCTs were the total number of follow-up tests, number of colposcopies, and false-positive rates. Although follow-up tests and colposcopies are essential to detection of cancer, they represent a burden and risk to patients and are a proxy measure for downstream harms; therefore, screening strategies that minimize the number of tests and colposcopies per each cancer case averted are desirable. Colposcopy rates were higher for hrHPV testing alone than for cytology alone in 1 of 3 trials (NTCC Phase II) and similar in 2 trials (FINNISH and HPV FOCAL). False-positive rates for CIN 2+ were higher for hrHPV testing alone than for cytology alone in 1 trial (NTCC Phase II) and similar in another trial (FINNISH).</p>\r\n\r\n<h4 align=\"left\">Cotesting vs Cytology Alone</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Four RCTs (N &gt; 130,000 women) compared screening with cytology alone vs cotesting (cytology in combination with hrHPV testing): the NTCC Phase I trial in Italy,<sup>28,32,34</sup> Swedescreen in Sweden,<sup>36,37</sup> A Randomized Trial in Screening to Improve Cytology (ARTISTIC) in the United Kingdom,<sup>38-40</sup> and the Population-Based Screening Study Amsterdam (POBASCAM) in the Netherlands.<sup>41</sup> In all 4 trials, the cumulative relative ratio of CIN 3+ detection between the 2 strategies (cotesting vs cytology alone) were not statistically significant after 2 rounds of screening. The trials varied considerably in starting age (20 to 29 years), stopping age (38 to 64 years), and follow-up protocols. The NTCC Phase I, ARTISTIC, and POBASCAM trials reported 2 rounds of screening at 3- to 5-year intervals, whereas Swedescreen reported 1 round of screening with registry follow-up at 3 years. Two trials (Swedescreen and POBASCAM) reported no difference between screening strategies at 13 to 14 years of follow-up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These 4 trials reported hrHPV positive rates of 7% to 22% for screening with cotesting; again, rates were highest among women younger than 30 or 35 years. Colposcopy rates were higher for screening with cotesting than for cytology alone in 2 trials (ARTISTIC and NTCC Phase I) and not reported in the other 2 trials (Swedescreen and POBASCAM). False-positive rates were higher for screening with cotesting in 3 of 4 trials (Swedescreen did not report the false-positive rate for the intervention group).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ARTISTIC trial also surveyed a subsample of patients (N = 2508) about the psychological effects of screening.<sup>42</sup> It found no difference in distress or anxiety between women screened with cotesting and women screened with cytology alone. Women in the cotesting group who were notified of positive HPV results reported lower sexual satisfaction regardless of their cytology results, but there were no statistically significant differences in psychological distress or anxiety between study groups.<sup>38</sup> A separate cross-sectional study used a survey to evaluate the psychological effects of screening with hrHPV cotesting in women aged 20 to 64 years (N = 428) and found that women who received a positive HPV result were more distressed and had more negative feelings about their sexual partners than women who received a negative HPV result.<sup>43</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Additional Evidence From Observational Studies</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to RCTs, the USPSTF also reviewed evidence from an individual participant data meta-analysis that pooled patients from 4 trials (NTCC Phase I, Swedescreen, ARTISTIC, and POBASCAM), as well as a single trial of primary hrHPV testing (NTCC Phase II). The meta-analysis found a 40% lower incidence of invasive cervical cancer among patients screened with some form of hrHPV testing compared with cytology alone.<sup>44</sup> Biopsy rates from the individual participant data meta-analysis suggest that these higher colposcopy rates led to higher rates of biopsy with cotesting than with cytology alone. However, since the meta-analysis pooled data from trials with distinctly different screening strategies and hrHPV test types, these findings cannot be interpreted with certainty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The trial evidence was also supplemented with results from 4 cohort studies. One study considered primary hrHPV screening,<sup>45</sup> 2 studies considered cotesting,<sup>46-51</sup> and 1 reported on cotesting among underscreened women.<sup>52</sup> These outcomes were not notably different from the trial outcomes. A recently published report on women (N = 1,262,713) screened 1 or more times in Kaiser Permanente Northern California between 2003 and 2015, which included women aged 25 to 29 years screened with cytology and triage with hrHPV testing for atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance and women aged 30 to 77 years screened with cotesting, also suggests that women who test negative for hrHPV have very low rates of subsequent CIN 3+, regardless of cytology results.<sup>53</sup> It is important to note that women younger than 30 or 35 years had higher hrHPV-positive and CIN 3+ rates, accompanied by higher colposcopy rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Data from long-term follow-up studies<sup>37,54</sup> and a large US cohort study<sup>55</sup> suggest a minimal risk of missing cervical cancer among women who test negative with cotesting or primary hrHPV screening. An analysis of long-term data from Kaiser Permanente Northern California suggests that women with 1 or more negative results from cotesting have a reduced risk for future cancer.<sup>53</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Benefits and Harms of Various Screening Strategies Based on Decision Modeling</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The decision model commissioned by the USPSTF reported benefits and harms consistent with the outcomes observed in the trials. Both hrHPV testing alone and cotesting would avert approximately 1 additional cancer case per 1000 women screened compared with cytology alone (17.8 vs 16.5 cases, respectively), representing a very small improvement in life-years gained (64,193 vs 64,182 life-years, respectively).<sup>3</sup> However, these 2 screening strategies would also subject women to more tests and procedures. Although no head-to-head trials compared screening with hrHPV testing alone vs cotesting, modeling suggests that both hrHPV testing alone and cotesting offer similar benefit over cytology in terms of cancer cases averted and are also similar in terms of the number of colposcopies required (1630 vs 1635, respectively). In summary, all 3 screening strategies offer substantial benefit in terms of reducing cancer incidence and mortality compared with no screening.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Screening Interval Based on Decision Modeling</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The decision model conducted for the 2012 USPSTF recommendation found that screening every 3 years with cytology alone starting at age 21 years confers a similar number of life-years gained as annual screening (69, 247 vs 69,213 life-years gained per 1000 women screened, respectively), yet results in fewer than half the number of colposcopies and fewer false-positive results.<sup>27</sup> Screening intervals for hrHPV testing varied across trials from 2 to 5 years, and observational studies of primary hrHPV testing and cotesting examined intervals from 3 to 5 years. For women aged 30 to 65 years, modeling suggests similar life-years gained with 3- and 5-year screening intervals but more tests and procedures with a 3-year screening interval (64,193.19 vs 64,193.07 life-years gained per 1000 women screened every 3 and 5 years, respectively).<sup>3</sup> Thus, the USPSTF recommends 5-year screening intervals for hrHPV testing alone or for cotesting based on evidence from RCTs, observational data, and modeling studies (<a href=\"#tab\">Table</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<h4 align=\"left\">Women Older Than 65 Years</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>None of the screening trials enrolled women older than 65 years, so direct evidence on when to stop screening is not available. When deliberating on the age at which to stop screening, the USPSTF considered the incidence of cervical cancer in older women and whether the pattern of cervical cancer incidence differs in screened vs unscreened women. The incidence and prevalence of CIN peak in the midreproductive years and begin to decline in approximately the fourth decade of life, a general pattern also apparent among certain previously unscreened women. Cervical cancer in older women is not more aggressive or rapidly progressive than it is in younger women. The rate of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions diagnosed by cytology is low in older women who have had adequate prior screening. The decision model commissioned by the USPSTF also supports the current practice of stopping screening at age 65 years in adequately screened women. The model projected that extending screening beyond age 65 years in women with an adequate screening history would not have significant benefit using any of the considered screening strategies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although screening women older than 65 years who have an adequate screening history is not recommended, data suggest that screening rates begin to decline before that age. As a result, approximately 13% of 65-year-old women have not been adequately screened, and this number increases to 37.1% if the patient has no regular health care provider.<sup>13</sup> A Kaiser Permanente registry study found that the majority of cases of invasive cervical cancer among women older than 65 years occurred among those who had not met criteria for stopping screening.<sup>55,62</sup> This suggests that the decision to stop screening at age 65 years should only be made after confirming that the patient has received prior adequate screening. Current guidelines define adequate screening as 3 consecutive negative cytology results or 2 consecutive negative HPV results within 10 years before stopping screening, with the most recent test performed within 5 years.<sup>6</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h4 align=\"left\">Women Who Have Had a Hysterectomy With Removal of the Cervix</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Two large studies have documented the low risk for cytology abnormalities after hysterectomy. A cross-sectional study of more than 5000 cytology tests among women older than 50 years found that identification of vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia and cancer was rare in this age group after hysterectomy.<sup>63</sup> In a second study of more than 10,000 Pap tests performed over 2 years in 6265 women who had a hysterectomy with removal of the cervix, screening yielded 104 abnormal Pap test results and no cases of cervical cancer; in addition, 6 cases of high-grade vaginal lesions were detected, but it is not known whether detection of these cases improved clinical outcomes.<sup>64</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Harms of Screening</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Screening with cervical cytology and hrHPV testing can lead to harms, including more frequent follow-up testing and invasive diagnostic procedures (eg, colposcopy and cervical biopsy), as well as unnecessary treatment in women with false-positive results. Evidence from RCTs and observational studies indicate that harms from diagnostic procedures include vaginal bleeding, pain, infection, and failure to diagnose (due to inadequate sampling). Abnormal screening test results are also associated with psychological harms. In particular, women who received positive hrHPV results reported greater distress and lower satisfaction with past and current sexual partners than women who received abnormal cytology results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the harms of hrHPV testing alone in women aged 21 to 29 years are moderate. Primary hrHPV testing has been found to result in high rates of positive tests in this age group, in which HPV infections are likely to resolve spontaneously. The high frequency of transient HPV infection among women younger than 30 years can lead to unnecessary follow-up diagnostic and treatment interventions with potential for harm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the harms of screening for cervical cancer (with cytology alone, hrHPV testing alone, or cotesting with both) in women aged 30 to 65 years are moderate. Screening strategies that include hrHPV testing are slightly more sensitive than those that include cytology alone but also yield more false-positive results. Cotesting is also slightly more sensitive than cytology alone but leads to the highest false-positive rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the harms of screening for cervical cancer in women older than 65 years who have had adequate prior screening and are not otherwise at high risk are at least small. The USPSTF also found adequate evidence that the harms of screening for cervical cancer in women younger than 21 years are moderate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that screening for cervical cancer in women who have had a hysterectomy with removal of the cervix and do not have a history of a high-grade precancerous lesion or cervical cancer is associated with harms.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Harms of Treatment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The harms of treatment include risks from the treatment procedure and the potential subsequent consequences of treatment. Evidence from observational studies indicates that certain treatments for precancerous lesions (eg, cold-knife conization and loop excision) are associated with subsequent adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as preterm delivery and related complications.<sup>2</sup> The USPSTF found convincing evidence that many precancerous cervical lesions will regress and that other lesions are indolent, slow growing, and will not become clinically important over a woman&rsquo;s lifetime; identification and treatment of these lesions constitute overdiagnosis. Estimating the precise magnitude of overdiagnosis associated with any screening or treatment strategy is difficult, but it is of concern because it confers no benefit and leads to unnecessary surveillance, diagnostic tests, and treatments, with associated harms.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There is convincing evidence that screening with cervical cytology alone, primary hrHPV testing alone, or cotesting can detect high-grade precancerous cervical lesions and cervical cancer. The USPSTF found convincing evidence that screening women aged 21 to 65 years substantially reduces cervical cancer incidence and mortality. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the harms of screening for cervical cancer (with cytology alone, hrHPV testing alone, or cotesting with both) in women aged 30 to 65 years are moderate. The USPSTF concludes with high certainty that the benefits of screening every 3 years with cytology alone in women aged 21 to 29 years substantially outweigh the harms. The USPSTF concludes with high certainty that the benefits of screening every 3 years with cytology alone, every 5 years with hrHPV testing alone, or every 5 years with both in combination in women aged 30 to 65 years outweigh the harms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that screening women older than 65 years who have had adequate prior screening and women younger than 21 years does not provide significant benefit. There is convincing evidence that screening women who have had a hysterectomy with removal of the cervix for indications other than a high-grade precancerous lesion or cervical cancer provides no benefit. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the harms of screening for cervical cancer in women younger than 21 years and of screening with hrHPV testing alone in women aged 21 to 29 years are moderate. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the harms of screening for cervical cancer in women older than 65 years who have had adequate prior screening and are not otherwise at high risk are at least small. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that screening for cervical cancer in women who have had a hysterectomy with removal of the cervix and do not have a history of a high-grade precancerous lesion or cervical cancer is associated with harms. The USPSTF concludes with moderate to high certainty that screening women older than 65 years who have had adequate prior screening and are not otherwise at high risk for cervical cancer, screening women younger than 21 years, and screening women who have had a hysterectomy with removal of the cervix for indications other than a high-grade precancerous lesion or cervical cancer does not result in a positive net benefit.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The natural history of cervical cancer has been well studied. Infection of the cervix with HPV is generally transient, but when the infection is not cleared by an appropriate immune response and the virus is of an oncogenic type, the infection can result in incorporation of HPV gene sequences into the host genome, which can lead to precancerous lesions. The long preclinical phase from infection to development of precancerous lesions and cervical cancer allows for the opportunity to effectively screen for, identify, and treat precancerous lesions, thereby reducing cervical cancer incidence and mortality.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from September 12, 2017, through October 13, 2017. Many comments pointed to a need for greater clarity in describing differences between cotesting and primary hrHPV testing. Several comments requested clarification on the information presented in the modeling report. Some comments highlighted implementation issues due to a lack of tests approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for primary cervical cancer screening. In response to these comments, the USPSTF now notes throughout the recommendation statement that women aged 30 to 65 years may choose to get screened every 3 years with cervical cytology alone, every 5 years with hrHPV testing alone, or every 5 years with cotesting. Accordingly, the USPSTF provided a table in the Clinical Considerations section that presents detailed information about the available evidence on the effectiveness, strengths, limitations, and unique considerations of each screening method. For further clarification on the modeling study, the USPSTF added the calibrated input parameter values, which should enable informed readers to assess the estimates used. The USPSTF added language throughout the recommendation statement to emphasize the importance of several different factors that affect overall screening effectiveness, including the primary screening test, screening ages, screening interval, test characteristics, and follow-up protocols, including triage of screen-positive women.</p><h2>Table.

Treatment to prevent CVD events by modifying risk factors is currently informed by the Framingham Risk Score, the Pooled Cohort Equations, or similar CVD risk assessment models. If current CVD risk assessment models could be improved by adding more risk factors, treatment might be better targeted, thereby maximizing the benefits and minimizing the harms.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Detection</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that adding the ABI, hsCRP level, or CAC score to existing CVD risk assessment models (Framingham Risk Score [which estimates a person&rsquo;s 10-year risk of coronary heart disease] or Pooled Cohort Equations [which estimate 10-year risk of myocardial infarction, death from coronary heart disease, or stroke]) may improve calibration (agreement between observed and predicted outcomes), discrimination (ability to distinguish between people who will and will not experience an event), and reclassification (ability to correctly reassign people into clinically meaningful risk strata ). The USPSTF chose to review these 3 nontraditional risk factors because prior evidence reviews identified them as the most promising to improve on existing CVD risk assessment tools.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Benefits of Risk Assessment and Intervention</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to assess whether treatment decisions guided by ABI, hsCRP level, or CAC score test results, when added to existing CVD risk assessment models, lead to reduced incidence of CVD events or mortality.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Harms of Risk Assessment and Intervention</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence to bound the harms of risk assessment and intervention as small. When direct evidence is limited, absent, or restricted to select populations or clinical scenarios, the USPSTF may place conceptual upper or lower bounds on the magnitude of benefit or harms.

It is the most common cause of death among adults in the United States, accounting for 1 in 3 deaths each year.<sup>1</sup> Although CVD remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, CVD mortality has been decreasing over time in the United States. Currently, the annual incidence of new cases of myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular accident in the United States is 580,000 and 610,000, respectively.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The incidence of CVD varies by sex. Men, on average, develop CVD about 10 years earlier than women.<sup>2</sup> The burden of CVD increases with age. In 2015, the age-adjusted prevalence of coronary artery disease among US adults aged 45 to 64 years was 6.1%, compared with 16.4% among those aged 65 to 74 years and 23.3% among those 75 years or older.<sup>3</sup> In the same year, 2.7%, 5.6%, and 11.2% of US adults in these age groups, respectively, experienced a stroke. Prevalence also varies by race/ethnicity; in 2015, the prevalence of coronary artery disease was 2 times greater among American Indian/Alaskan Native adults than Asian adults (9.3% vs 3.7%, respectively). Prevalence in Hispanic, African American, and white adults was similar, at 5.1%, 5.4%, and 5.6%, respectively.<sup>3</sup> However, strokes were most common among African American adults (3.7%), followed by white (2.4%), Hispanic (2.4%), American Indian/Alaska Native (2.2%), and Asian (1.4%) adults.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Potential Harms</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Testing for hsCRP level and the ABI is noninvasive, and there is little direct harm from the tests. Harms of testing for CAC score include exposure to radiation and incidental findings on computed tomography of the chest, such as pulmonary nodules, that may lead to further invasive testing and procedures. Abnormal test results may lead to further testing, procedures, and lifelong medication use without proof of benefit but with expense and potential adverse effects for the patient. Psychological harms may result from reclassification into a higher-risk category for CVD events.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Current Practice</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Only 1 of the risk assessment models currently used in the United States, the Reynolds Risk Score, incorporates hsCRP level into its risk calculation. A number of guidelines, including those from the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association, recommend considering hsCRP level, the ABI, or CAC score to clarify treatment decisions for patients whose risk assessment is borderline or unclear using a traditional risk assessment model.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Assessment of Risk</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Accurate identification of persons at high risk for CVD events, particularly nonfatal myocardial infarction or stroke, and CVD death provides the opportunity for more intensive risk factor management to reduce the likelihood of such an event. In addition, identifying persons at low risk may allow for a reduction in interventions with a low benefit to risk ratio for those not likely to benefit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several traditional risk factors are associated with higher risk for CVD events, including older age, male sex, high blood pressure, current smoking, abnormal cholesterol levels, diabetes, obesity, and physical inactivity. Risk factors can be combined in many ways to classify a person&rsquo;s risk for a CVD event as low, intermediate, or high. Several calculators and models are available to quantify a person&rsquo;s 10-year CVD event risk. The Framingham Risk Score (which estimates a person&rsquo;s 10-year risk of coronary heart disease) was 1 of the first widely used risk assessment tools. Persons with a 10-year CVD event risk greater than 20% are generally considered at high risk, those with a 10-year risk less than 10% are considered at low risk, and those in the 10% to 20% range are considered at intermediate risk. The Pooled Cohort Equations (which estimate 10-year risk of myocardial infarction, death from coronary heart disease, or stroke) were introduced in 2013 and were developed using more contemporary and diverse cohort data, with the inclusion of race/ethnicity and diabetes. Persons with a 10-year CVD event risk less than 7.5% are considered at low risk, and those with a 10-year risk of 7.5% or greater are considered at high risk.<sup>4</sup> The distribution of estimated CVD risk in the US population is highly influenced by age and sex. Population estimates of the distribution of 10-year CVD event risk assessed by the Pooled Cohort Equations, which categorize risk using somewhat different thresholds, and using 2001-2010 data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey show that the vast majority of US adults aged 40 to 49 years have an estimated 10-year CVD event risk of 7% or less (93% of women and 81% of men). Among US adults aged 50 to 59 years, 80% of women and 46% of men have an estimated 10-year CVD event risk of 7% or less; 42% of women and 7% of men aged 60 to 69 years have an estimated 10-year CVD event risk of 7% or less.<sup>5</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Screening Tests</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Cardiovascular disease risk assessment in the United States has been generally based on the Framingham Risk Score and, more recently, the Pooled Cohort Equations. However, both have been documented to overestimate and underestimate risk in some persons. Therefore, identification of additional tests (for nontraditional risk factors) that could improve risk prediction, including the ABI, hsCRP level, and CAC score, is of interest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ABI is the ratio of the systolic blood pressure at the ankle (measuring the pressure proximal to the dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial artery) to the systolic blood pressure at the brachial artery. A value less than 0.9 indicates peripheral artery disease.<sup>6</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>High-sensitivity C-reactive protein is a serum protein involved in inflammatory and immune responses. Testing for hsCRP level involves a single blood sample, and the test is widely available. A threshold of greater than 2 or 3 mg/L is used in clinical practice to signify increased cardiovascular risk.<sup>7-9</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Coronary artery calcium score is obtained by electron-beam or multidetector computed tomography, which measure the calcium content in the coronary arteries.

Similarly, studies assessing nontraditional risk factors in isolation are of limited value, given that current treatment recommendations are based on risk assessment with the Framingham Risk Score or Pooled Cohort Equations. Good-quality studies comparing traditional risk assessment with traditional risk assessment plus the ABI, hsCRP level, or CAC scores are needed to measure the effect of adding nontraditional risk factors on clinical decision thresholds and patient outcomes (CVD events and mortality). Studies are especially needed in more diverse populations (women, racial/ethnic minorities, persons of lower socioeconomic status), in whom assessment of nontraditional risk factors may help address the shortcomings of traditional risk models. In addition, well-designed prospective studies reflective of real-world practice are needed to identify the downstream effects of CAC score on additional testing and procedures.</p><h2>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h2><p>This recommendation replaces the 2009 USPSTF recommendation.<sup>20</sup> The previous recommendation considered the evidence on the addition of several risk factors to the Framingham Risk Score. The major change in the current recommendation is that the USPSTF evaluated the Pooled Cohort Equations in addition to the Framingham Risk Score and focused on only 3 nontraditional risk factors&mdash;the ABI, hsCRP level, and CAC score.</p>","other":"<h2>Recommendations of Others</h2><p>The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists&rsquo; 2017 guidelines include hsCRP level, as part of the Reynolds Risk Score, as a possible CVD risk assessment tool and to stratify borderline cases, and also states that CAC score can be useful in refining risk stratification.<sup>40</sup> The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association encourage using the Pooled Cohort Equations to assess 10-year risk of an initial hard CVD event (defined as stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or CVD death). If risk-based treatment is still uncertain, they recommend using 1 or more of the nontraditional risk factors (including the ABI, hsCRP level, or CAC score) or family history to help clarify treatment decisions.<sup>4</sup> The Canadian Cardiovascular Society encourages use of a modified Framingham Risk Score risk assessment tool in asymptomatic persons to assess 10-year risk of any CVD event. It recommends judicious use of secondary testing among patients for whom the need for statin therapy is unclear.<sup>41</sup> The European Society of Cardiology uses the Systemic Coronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE) risk charts, which do not include the ABI, hsCRP level, or CAC score, to determine 10-year risk of a fatal CVD event.<sup>42</sup> The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence uses the QRISK3 risk tool, which does not include the ABI, hsCRP level, or CAC score, to estimate 10-year risk of a CVD event.<sup>43</sup> The Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) uses the ASSIGN risk score to determine the 10-year risk of a CVD event, which does not include the ABI, hsCRP level, or CAC score.<sup>44</sup></p>","discussion":"<h2>Discussion</h2><h3 align=\"left\">Burden of Disease</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death among adults in the United States, accounting for 1 in 3 deaths each year. Although it remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality, CVD mortality has been decreasing over time in the United States. Currently, the annual incidence of new cases of myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular accident in the United States is 580,000 and 610,000, respectively.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Scope of Review</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF commissioned a systematic evidence review<sup>7,19</sup> to update its 2009 recommendation on using nontraditional risk factors in assessment of coronary heart disease risk.<sup>20</sup> Unlike the 2009 recommendation, the current recommendation focuses on 3 nontraditional risk factors&mdash;the ABI, hsCRP level, and CAC score. The USPSTF chose these risk factors because they have the most promising evidence base, are reliably measured, are independently associated with CVD risk or CVD events, and the prevalence and distribution of abnormal and normal values have been described in the target population. The review focused on the health benefits (reduction in CVD events, CVD mortality, and overall mortality) and harms of CVD risk assessment and treatment guided by nontraditional risk factors combined with the Pooled Cohort Equations or Framingham Risk Score compared with using either risk assessment model alone. The review also evaluated whether the use of nontraditional risk factors, when added to existing CVD risk assessment models, improves measures of calibration, discrimination, and risk reclassification.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the same time, the USPSTF also commissioned a separate systematic evidence review to update its 2013 recommendation on screening for peripheral artery disease and CVD risk assessment with the ABI.<sup>21</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Accuracy of Screening Tests</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed evidence of whether the ABI, hsCRP level, or CAC score improves calibration, discrimination, or risk reclassification when added to CVD risk assessment models using traditional risk factors. Calibration measures the agreement between observed and predicted outcomes, discrimination measures the ability to distinguish between persons who will and will not have an event, and reclassification measures the ability to (correctly) reassign persons into clinically meaningful risk strata. The USPSTF found 10 articles representing 22 cohorts for the ABI, 25 articles representing 49 cohorts for hsCRP level, and 19 articles representing 10 cohorts for CAC score, although few studies reported all 3 measures; most did not use the published versions of the Framingham Risk Score or the Pooled Cohort Equations as the base model.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In general, all cohort studies examining calibration (5 for the ABI, 9 for hsCRP level, and 8 for CAC score) found that adding 1 of these 3 nontraditional risk factors improved calibration, although preferred measures of calibration were rarely reported and only 1 study (of CAC score) used the Pooled Cohort Equations as a base model. The calibration plots available for hsCRP demonstrate that, although adding hsCRP level improved calibration for some groups, it worsened calibration for others.<sup>22,23</sup> An individual patient data meta-analysis of 18 cohorts found that the ABI improved discrimination when added to the Framingham Risk Score, but only for women.<sup>24</sup> A separate analysis of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) cohort (which was not included in the individual patient data meta-analysis) found no improvement from adding the ABI to the Pooled Cohort Equations.<sup>25</sup> Evidence (25 studies) for adding hsCRP was inconsistent, showing at most a small improvement in discrimination.<sup>7</sup> In the only study that added hsCRP to the Pooled Cohort Equations (MESA), hsCRP level did not improve discrimination.<sup>25</sup> Adding CAC score (18 studies) to various risk assessment models resulted in at least a small, and often larger, improvement in discrimination.<sup>7</sup> However, the magnitude of improvement decreased as the discrimination of the base model improved. Four studies<sup>25-28</sup> that added CAC score to the Pooled Cohort Equations found a very small to small improvement (0.02-0.04) to the area under the curve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The evidence for risk reclassification was largely similar to the evidence for discrimination. Different studies used different risk strata, but those that used the Framingham Risk Score as the base model generally used less than 10% for low risk, 10% to 20% for intermediate risk, and greater than 20% for high risk, while studies using the Pooled Cohort Equations as the base model used greater than 7.5% for increased risk. In general, studies found that the ABI, hsCRP level, and CAC score tended to have positive event net reclassification (ie, more persons who had a CVD event were correctly reclassified to a higher-risk category than were incorrectly reclassified to a lower-risk category). The ABI (in women) and CAC score tended to have negative nonevent net reclassification (ie, more persons who did not have a CVD event were incorrectly reclassified to a higher-risk category than were correctly reclassified to a lower-risk category). Because only a few persons in the general population have CVD events (myocardial infarction, stroke, or CVD death) in a given period, this suggests that on balance, more persons would be inappropriately than appropriately reclassified.<sup>7</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Effectiveness of Risk Assessment and Treatment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found only 1 study that directly assessed the potential benefit on clinical outcomes of adding 1 of these 3 nontraditional risk factors to traditional risk assessment models.<sup>29</sup> This fair-quality randomized clinical trial (RCT) assigned asymptomatic volunteers (N = 2137) with no history of CVD to CAC scoring plus risk factor assessment counseling vs risk factor assessment counseling alone. At 4 years, there was no difference in CVD outcomes between the 2 groups; however, the study was not adequately powered to detect a difference in patient health outcomes.<sup>29</sup> The USPSTF found no studies that assessed the incremental benefit on health outcomes of adding the ABI or hsCRP level to traditional risk factor assessment. The Viborg Vascular (VIVA) screening trial<sup>30</sup> recently reported interim results; this trial randomized men aged 65 to 74 years to invitation for a triple screening (screening for high blood pressure, abdominal aortic aneurysm, and peripheral artery disease using the ABI) or no screening and found a decrease in mortality with screening; however, it was not possible to determine how much of the decrease was attributable to screening for peripheral artery disease and how much was attributable to screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm and high blood pressure, both of which are already recommended screenings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no trials evaluating the additional benefit of adding the ABI, hsCRP level, or CAC score to traditional risk assessment models for guiding decisions about specific interventions to prevent CVD. The USPSTF found a few studies evaluating the use of a nontraditional risk factor as a single intervention to guide decisions about specific preventive medications compared with usual care. Two RCTs (total N = 4626) compared using the ABI to guide decisions to start aspirin therapy vs usual care and found no benefit in CVD outcomes at 7 years of follow-up.<sup>31,32</sup> However, both studies used atypical cutoff points for diagnosing peripheral artery disease, and the results may not be applicable to current practice. One RCT (Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin [JUPITER]; N = 17,802) compared hsCRP screening vs usual care to guide high-intensity statin therapy and found benefit at 1.9 years of follow-up in the reduction of CVD events in the hsCRP group.<sup>9</sup> However, because the study only randomized persons with elevated hsCRP levels, it is not known whether patients with lower hsCRP levels would also have benefited from high-intensity statin therapy. Further, many of these patients met criteria for statin therapy based on traditional CVD risk assessment and would already have been candidates for treatment. One study (n = 1005) of using CAC score to guide statin therapy found no benefit at 4 years in the reduction of CVD events.<sup>33</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A systematic review that addressed the effect of screening with CAC score on risk perception, adherence to medication, and behavioral therapies found only 2 studies comparing traditional CVD risk assessment vs CAC score. Neither of these studies found that screening with CAC score was superior to traditional CVD risk assessment for preventive medication use or risk factor management.<sup>5</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The main potential harm of adding nontraditional risk factors to CVD risk assessment is radiation exposure from CAC score testing, although the dosage (0.4 to 2.1 mSv) is relatively low.<sup>7</sup> More general potential harms are false-positive test results and subsequent invasive diagnostic procedures (such as coronary angiography). Three studies assessing the effect of CAC score on health care utilization found conflicting results. The Early Identification of Subclinical Atherosclerosis by Noninvasive Imaging Research (EISNER) study, an RCT of CAC score use in an academic setting, found no statistically significant increase in downstream cardiac testing and procedures.<sup>29</sup> In contrast, a retrospective study of Medicare data found that use of CAC score increased downstream cardiac testing and procedures compared with use of hsCRP and lipid screening,<sup>34</sup> while a second smaller observational study found no difference.<sup>35</sup> A systematic review of 7 studies found that the prevalence of incidental findings on computed tomography for CAC score ranged from 8% to 58%. The ultimate outcomes of subsequent diagnostic procedures for these incidental findings, whether positive or negative, are not known.<sup>36</sup> Two studies found no short-term psychological harms from use of CAC score in CVD risk assessment.<sup>37,38</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treatment with aspirin and statins to prevent CVD events has some potential harms (specifically bleeding and increased incidence of diabetes, respectively), but these harms are generally accepted to be a reasonable trade-off among persons at higher risk of CVD events.<sup>39</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that adding the ABI, hsCRP level, and CAC score to existing CVD risk assessment models results in small improvements in discrimination and reclassification. However, the clinical meaning of these changes is largely unknown. Evidence on adding the ABI, hsCRP level, and CAC score to the Pooled Cohort Equations is sparse, which makes it difficult to infer the clinical significance of these findings. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to assess whether treatment decisions guided by the ABI, hsCRP level, or CAC score, in addition to risk factors in existing CVD risk assessment models, leads to reduced incidence of CVD events or mortality. Few studies were available and were either underpowered or used atypical test thresholds for intervention. The USPSTF found adequate evidence to bound the harms of early detection and interventions as small. The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of using the ABI, hsCRP level, or CAC score in risk assessment for CVD in asymptomatic adults to prevent CVD events.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from January 16, 2018, to February 12, 2018. Many comments expressed belief that the evidence for risk assessment with CAC score was strong enough to warrant a separate positive recommendation. Although adding CAC score to traditional risk assessment models improved discrimination and reclassification, the USPSTF found inadequate evidence that this change would translate into improved health outcomes among asymptomatic patients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several comments expressed concern that the USPSTF overestimated the harms associated with CAC score testing (radiation exposure, downstream testing). The USPSTF added language to clarify that it determined that the harms associated with the addition of nontraditional risk factors, including CAC score, are small in magnitude.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several comments noted that the addition of nontraditional risk factors, especially CAC score, is useful for patients whose risk stratification is unclear or for those who fall into intermediate-risk groups. The USPSTF did not find convincing evidence that adding nontraditional risk factors to traditional risk factors improves reclassification in intermediate-risk groups. As clinical practice moves toward a single threshold for treatment, this concern may no longer be relevant in clinical decision making. Some comments also expressed belief that CAC score testing leads to better adherence to preventive therapies (ie, medications and lifestyle changes). The USPSTF carefully reviewed the available evidence and concluded that CAC score testing showed no benefit over traditional CVD risk assessment in preventive medication use or risk factor control. The USPSTF added language to address this point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several comments recommended including more information on the differences between the Framingham Risk Score and the Pooled Cohort Equations as well as population distribution of risk. The USPSTF included information in the Clinical Considerations section to clarify these differences and provide more information on risk in the general US population. Last, comments noted that the USPSTF assessment may not be applicable across sex, race/ethnicity, family history, and socioeconomic status. The USPSTF included language indicating the need for more studies in these subpopulations.</p>","topic":"Cardiovascular Disease: Risk Assessment With Nontraditional Risk Factors","keywords":"Cardiovascular Disease|Cardiovascular|Coronary Heart Disease|Nontraditional Risk Factors|Non-Traditional","pubDate":"2018-07-10","categories":["5"],"tool":["154","156","155"]},"395":{"topicType":"Screening","topicYear":2017,"uspstfAlias":"vision-in-children-ages-6-months-to-5-years-screening","specific":[372,373],"title":"Vision in Children Ages 6 Months to 5 Years: Screening","rationale":"<h2>Rationale</h2><h3>Importance</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the most important causes of vision abnormalities in children is amblyopia (also known as &ldquo;lazy eye&rdquo;). Amblyopia is an alteration in the visual neural pathway in a child&rsquo;s developing brain that can lead to permanent vision loss in the affected eye.<sup>1,2</sup> It usually occurs in 1 eye but can occur in both. Risk factors associated with the development of amblyopia include strabismus (ocular misalignment); vision deprivation caused by media opacity (eg, cataracts); high, uncorrected refractive errors (eg, myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism); and anisometropia (<a href=\"#table1\">Table 1</a>). Other common causes of vision abnormalities are nonamblyopic strabismus and nonamblyopic refractive error.<sup>1</sup> Among children younger than 6 years, 1% to 6% have amblyopia or its risk factors (strabismus, anisometropia, or both), which, if left untreated, could lead to amblyopia.<sup>1,3-7</sup> Early identification of vision abnormalities could prevent the development of amblyopia.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Detection</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that vision screening tools are accurate in detecting vision abnormalities, including refractive errors, strabismus, and amblyopia. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to compare screening accuracy across age groups (&lt;3 vs &ge;3 years). Many studies of clinical accuracy did not enroll children younger than 3 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that treatment of amblyopia or its risk factors in children aged 3 to 5 years leads to improved visual acuity. The USPSTF determined that the magnitude of improvement in visual acuity is of moderate benefit. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence that treatment reduced the incidence of long-term amblyopia or improved school performance, functioning, or quality of life. Limited evidence suggests that screening can potentially reduce psychosocial harms. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence that treatment of amblyopia or its risk factors in children younger than 3 years leads to improved vision outcomes (ie, visual acuity) or other benefits.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Harms of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence to assess harms of vision screening tests in children aged 3 to 5 years, including higher false-positive rates in low-prevalence populations. False-positive screening results may lead to overdiagnosis or unnecessary treatment. Limited evidence suggests that eye patching in children aged 3 to 5 years does not worsen visual acuity in the nonamblyopic eye but may be associated with psychological harms, such as child or parental upset or concern. The USPSTF found adequate evidence to bound the potential harms of vision screening and treatment in children aged 3 to 5 years as small, based on the nature of the interventions. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the harms of treatment in children younger than 3 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that vision screening to detect amblyopia or its risk factors in children aged 3 to 5 years has a moderate net benefit. The USPSTF concludes that the benefits of vision screening to detect amblyopia or its risk factors in children younger than 3 years are uncertain, and that the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined for this age group.</p><h2>Table 1.

Risk factors for amblyopia include strabismus; high, uncorrected refractive errors (eg, myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism); anisometropia; and media opacity.<sup>1-3</sup> Additional risk factors associated with amblyopia, strabismus, or refractive errors include family history in a first-degree relative, prematurity, low birth weight, maternal substance abuse, maternal smoking during pregnancy, and low levels of parental education.<sup>1,8-13</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A variety of screening tests are used to identify vision abnormalities in children in primary care settings (<a href=\"#table2\">Table 2</a>). Visual acuity tests screen for visual deficits associated with amblyopia and refractive error. Ocular alignment tests screen for strabismus. Steroacuity tests assess depth perception.<sup>1,14</sup> For children younger than 3 years, screening may include the fixation and follow test (for visual acuity), the red reflex test (for media opacity), and the corneal light reflex test (for strabismus).<sup>1,14</sup> Instrument-based vision screening (ie, with autorefractors and photoscreeners) may be used in very young children, including infants. Autorefractors are computerized instruments that detect refractive errors; photoscreeners detect amblyopia risk factors (ocular alignment and media opacity) and refractive errors.<sup>1,15</sup> Vision screening in children older than 3 years may include the red reflex test, the cover-uncover test (for strabismus), the corneal light reflex test, visual acuity tests (eg, Snellen, Lea Symbols [Lea-Test], and HOTV [Precision Vision] charts), autorefractors and photoscreeners, and stereoacuity tests.<sup>1,14</sup> Children with positive findings should be referred for a complete eye examination to confirm the presence of vision problems and for further treatment.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Screening Interval</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF did not find adequate evidence to determine the optimal screening interval in children aged 3 to 5 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Treatment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Treatment depends on the specific condition and includes correction of any underlying refractive error with the use of corrective lenses, occlusion therapy for amblyopia (eg, eye patching, atropine eye drops, or Bangerter occlusion foils), or surgical interventions for some causes of refractory strabismus.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>\r\n\r\n<h4><em>Potential Preventable Burden</em></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Untreated amblyopia is not likely to spontaneously resolve.<sup>1,16,17</sup> Treatment efficacy decreases with age, with a risk of irreversible vision loss.<sup>1,18,20</sup> Untreated vision abnormalities can result in short- and long-term physical and psychological harms, such as accidents and injuries, experiencing bullying behaviors, poor visual motor skills, depression and anxiety, poor self-esteem, and problems at school and work.<sup>21-25</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h4><em>Current Practice</em></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Vision screening is routinely offered in most primary care settings. Screening rates among children aged 3 years are approximately 40% and increase with age.<sup>1,26</sup> One survey reported that 3% of pediatricians began vision screening at age 6 months.<sup>1,26</sup> Typical components of vision screening include assessments of visual acuity and strabismus. Younger children (&lt;3 years) are often unable to cooperate with some of the clinical screening tests performed in clinical practice, such as visual acuity testing, which may result in false-positive results. Some clinical practice guidelines now recommend using handheld autorefractors and photoscreeners as alternative approaches to screening in children 6 months and older because of improved child cooperation and improved accuracy.<sup>1,28</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One potential disadvantage of using some types of photoscreeners is the need for external interpretation of screening results. Children with positive findings should be referred for a complete eye examination to confirm the presence of vision abnormalities and for further treatment.</p><h2>Other Considerations</h2><h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF identified several gaps in the evidence. Well-designed trials are needed to better understand the effects of screening vs no screening, the optimal age for initiation of screening, and appropriate screening intervals. Additional studies are needed to determine the best screening approach and most favorable combinations of screening tests in primary care. There is also a need for studies that examine the benefits and harms of vision screening and treatment in children younger than 3 years and the long-term benefits and harms of preschool vision screening on health outcomes, such as quality of life, school performance, developmental trajectory, and functioning.</p><h2>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h2><p>This recommendation is an update of the USPSTF 2011 recommendation,<sup>32</sup> in which the USPSTF recommended vision screening for amblyopia and its risk factors in children aged 3 to 5 years (B recommendation). The USPSTF concluded that the evidence was insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of vision screening in children younger than 3 years (I statement). The current recommendation reaffirms the previous recommendation.</p>","other":"<h2>Recommendations of Others</h2><p>In 2016, the American Academy of Pediatrics, American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus, American Academy of Certified Orthoptists, and American Academy of Ophthalmology released a joint clinical report recommending preschool vision screening.<sup>41</sup> The joint report recommends vision assessment in children aged 6 months to 3 years with physical examination (eg, external inspection, the fixation and follow test, the red reflex test, and pupil examination). Instrument-based vision screening (with autorefractors or photoscreeners) may be used, when available, in children aged 1 to 3 years. Visual acuity screening may be attempted at age 3 years using HOTV or Lea Symbols charts; children aged 4 to 5 years should have visual acuity assessed using HOTV or Lea Symbols charts, the cover-uncover test, and the red reflex test.<sup>1,41</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The American Academy of Family Physicians recommends vision screening in all children at least once between the ages of 3 and 5 years to detect amblyopia or its risk factors; it concluded that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of vision screening in children younger than 3 years.<sup>42</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The American Optometric Association recommends initial vision screening in infants at birth. Regular comprehensive eye examinations should occur at age 6 months, age 3 years, and prior to entry into first grade; eye examinations should then occur at 2-year intervals unless children are considered at high risk for vision abnormalities.<sup>43</sup></p>","discussion":"<h2>Discussion</h2><h3>Burden of Disease</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The prevalence of amblyopia, strabismus, and anisometropia ranges from 1% to 6% among children younger than 6 years in the United States.<sup>1,3-7</sup> Strabismus is the most common cause of amblyopia among children younger than 3 years; among children aged 3 to 6 years, strabismus and anisometropia contribute equally.<sup>18</sup> Studies show that screening rates among children vary by race/ethnicity and family income.<sup>1,29</sup> Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data from 2009&ndash;2010 reported identical screening rates among black non-Hispanic children and white non-Hispanic children (80.7%); however, Hispanic children were less likely than non-Hispanic children to report vision screening (69.8%). Children whose families earned 200% or more above the federal poverty level were more likely to report vision screening than families with lower incomes.<sup>1,29</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among children younger than 6 years, 4% have myopia (nearsightedness, ie, visual images focus in front of the retina) and up to 20% have hyperopia (farsightedness, ie, visual images focus behind the retina). Among preschool-aged children, 5% to 10% have astigmatism.<sup>1,19-21</sup> Amblyopia may significantly increase the risk of severe vision abnormalities or vision loss in the nonamblyopic eye.<sup>1,30,31</sup> The estimated lifetime risk of vision loss in persons with amblyopia is 1.2% or greater.<sup>1,30,31</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF commissioned a systematic evidence review<sup>1</sup> to update its 2011 recommendation<sup>32</sup> on screening for amblyopia and its risk factors in children. The review examined the evidence on the accuracy of vision screening tests to detect amblyopia, its risk factors, or both and the benefits and harms of vision screening and treatment. Surgical interventions for refractory strabismus, cataracts, ptosis, or other conditions were considered to be out of scope for this review. General eye examination to detect ocular abnormalities not typically detected by vision screening was also considered to be out of scope for this review.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening Tests</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found 34 fair-quality studies (n=45,588 observations) that assessed the accuracy of various screening tests: visual acuity tests (6 studies), stereoacuity tests (4 studies), ocular alignment tests (1 study), combinations of clinical tests (4 studies), autorefractors (16 studies), photoscreeners (11 studies), and retinal birefringence scanning (1 study).<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fourteen studies recruited participants from ophthalmology clinics and 17 studies recruited from Head Start, community, or school settings; 2 studies were conducted in primary care settings, and 1 study did not report its setting. Across the studies, screening was administered by diverse personnel such as pediatricians, orthoptists, ophthalmologists, nurses, and Head Start staff.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>More than half of the studies (19 studies) were conducted in the United States. The remaining studies took place in Canada (5 studies), Europe (7 studies), and New Zealand or Australia (3 studies). Study sample sizes ranged from 63 to 4040 participants. The age of study participants ranged from 6 months to 6 years. About one-third of study participants were younger than 3 years; most were 3 years and older.<sup>1</sup> Many of the studies evaluating photoscreeners (n=6187 observations) included children younger than 3 years; 5 of the 16 studies evaluating autorefractors (n=16,712 observations) included children younger than 3 years.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Vision in Preschoolers (VIP) study (n &le;4040) provided data for several publications. The VIP study evaluated the accuracy of multiple screening tests for a wide range of vision conditions. It preferentially enrolled children aged 3 to 5 years from Head Start with amblyopia, amblyopia risk factors, reduced visual acuity, or strabismus.<sup>1,33</sup> Phase 1 of the study compared the accuracy of 11 screening tests.<sup>33</sup> Testing was conducted in specially equipped vans that provided a standard environment with minimal distractions. Phase 2 of the study compared screening performed by nurses vs lay staff and focused on 4 of the 11 screening tests.<sup>34</sup> The VIP study evaluated the accuracy of screening for a broader range of vision conditions than most other studies, including significant nonamblyogenic refractive error.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><em>Visual Acuity Tests</em></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Six fair-quality studies evaluated visual acuity tests (Lea Symbols or HOTV). Three publications from the VIP study (n=6019) assessed the accuracy of Lea Symbols for identifying amblyopia risk factors or clinically significant nonamblyogenic refractive error.<sup>1</sup> In phase 1 of the VIP study, visual acuity testing with Lea Symbols was associated with a positive likelihood ratio (LR) of 6.1 (95% CI, 4.8 to 7.6)<sup>33</sup> for detecting amblyopia risk factors or significant nonamblyogenic refractive error; among the 3-, 4-, and 5-year-old age groups, it ranged from 5.95 to 7.39.<sup>1</sup> The overall negative LR was 0.43 (95% CI, 0.38 to 0.50); among the 3-, 4-, and 5-year-old age groups, it ranged from 0.39 to 0.47. In phase 2 of the VIP study, positive LRs were 4.9 (95% CI, 4.0 to 6.0) and 3.7 (95% CI, 3.0 to 4.7) for screening performed by nurse and lay staff, respectively. Negative LRs were 0.57 (95% CI, 0.52 to 0.62) and 0.70 (95% CI, 0.65 to 0.76), respectively.<sup>1,34</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Three additional studies (n=773) assessed the accuracy of Lea Symbols for detecting amblyopia risk factors, significant refractive error, or astigmatism. Positive LRs ranged from 1.6 to 5.7 and negative LRs ranged from 0.05 to 0.21.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The VIP study (n=3121) found that the HOTV test was associated with an overall positive LR of 4.9 (95% CI, 3.9 to 6.1) for detecting amblyopia risk factors or significant nonamblyogenic refractive error.<sup>1,33</sup> Among the 3-, 4-, and 5-year-old age groups, positive LRs ranged from 3.76 to 6.83.<sup>1</sup> Overall, the negative LR was 0.52 (95% CI, 0.46 to 0.58); among the 3-, 4-, and 5-year-old age groups, it ranged from 0.47 to 0.62.<sup>1,33</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h4><em>Stereoacuity Tests</em></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Four fair-quality studies (n=7801) evaluated stereoacuity tests.<sup>1</sup> Most of the studies reported positive LRs ranging from 3.6 to 4.9. Negative LRs were in the minimal range for detecting amblyopia risk factors or significant nonamblyogenic refractive error and in the moderate range for detecting refractive error or strabismus.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h4><em>Ocular Alignment Tests</em></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>In phase 1 of the VIP study (n=3121), the cover-uncover test was associated with a positive LR of 7.9 (95% CI, 4.6 to 14.0) and a negative LR of 0.73 (95% CI, 0.15 to 0.85).<sup>1,33</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h4><em>Combinations of Clinical Tests</em></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Four fair-quality studies (n=1854) assessed combinations of tests of visual acuity, stereoacuity, and ocular alignment.<sup>1</sup> Three of the 4 studies reported positive LRs ranging from 12 to 17.<sup>1</sup> The fourth study, which reported a smaller positive LR of 4.8 (95% CI, 2.8 to 8.4), was the smallest (n=141) of the studies. The 4 studies reported negative LRs ranging from 0.10 to 0.91.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h4><em>Autorefractors</em></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Sixteen fair-quality studies (16,712 observations; n=80 to 4040) evaluated autorefractors.<sup>1</sup> Most studies reported moderate positive LRs and small negative LRs; some studies reported large positive LRs and negative LRs.<sup>1</sup> Five of the 16 studies evaluating autorefractors enrolled children younger than 3 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><em>Photoscreeners</em></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Eleven fair-quality studies (6187 observations; n=63 to 3121) assessed photoscreeners. Generally, most studies reported moderate positive LRs and small negative LRs.<sup>1</sup> Many of the studies evaluating photoscreeners enrolled children younger than 3 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><em>Retinal Birefringence Scanning</em></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>One fair-quality study (n=102) evaluated the Pediatric Vision Scanner (REBIScan). The positive LR was 10.4 (95% CI, 5.6 to 19.4) and the negative LR was 0.0.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h4><em>Direct Comparisons of Different Screening Tests</em></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Phase 1 of the VIP study compared 11 screening tests among children aged 3 to 5 years. The Lea Symbols and HOTV visual acuity tests and the Retinomax (Nikon), SureSight (Welch Allyn), and Power Refractor (Plusoptix) autorefractors had higher sensitivity for identifying any visual condition compared with the Random Dot E stereoacuity test (StereoOptical), Randot Stereo Smile Test II (StereoOptical), iScreen photoscreener (iScreen), and MTI photoscreener (Medical Technologies). However, LRs were similar. Positive LRs were generally in the moderate range and negative LRs were in the small to minimal range, with overlapping confidence intervals.<sup>1,33</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h4><em>Age and Testability</em></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Five studies evaluated whether the accuracy of different screening tests (including visual acuity tests, a combination of clinical tests, an autorefractor, and 2 photoscreeners) varies by age.<sup>1</sup> Data were limited and estimates were imprecise. Most studies of test accuracy (n=45,588 observations) did not enroll children younger than 3 years. Accuracy did not clearly differ among preschool-aged children by age group.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Testability (the ability to complete the screening test) may limit the usefulness of some clinical screening tests in children younger than 3 years. Testability was reported in many of the included studies; however, few reported data stratified by age or for children younger than 3 years. Testability generally exceeded 80% to 90% in children aged 3 years, with small increases through age 5 years. Studies that evaluated testability found better testability rates in older children (&ge;3 years); visual acuity and stereoacuity tests had low testability rates in children younger than 3 years.<sup>1</sup> Some data suggest that photoscreeners have high testability rates in children as young as 1 year.<sup>1</sup> The VIP study found testability rates near 100% (in children aged &ge;3 years) for autorefractors and photoscreeners.<sup>1,33</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>No eligible randomized clinical trials directly compared screening vs no screening. No available studies evaluated school performance, other functional outcomes, or quality of life. No eligible studies evaluated atropine eye drops or vision therapy.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF evaluated 2 fair-quality studies; a nested, randomized trial within a population-based cohort study (Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children [ALSPAC]) and the ALSPAC cohort study. The study assessed prevalence of amblyopia at age 7.5 years (using visual acuity testing); school performance, function, or quality of life outcomes were not evaluated.<sup>1,35,36</sup> The ALSPAC nested trial (n=3490) compared earlier, more intensive screening (at ages 8, 12, 18, 25, 31, and 37 months) vs 1-time screening at age 37 months.<sup>1,35</sup> Periodic screening (including clinical examination, a visual acuity test, and the cover-uncover test) from ages 8 to 37 months was associated with a 1% decrease in the prevalence of amblyopia at age 7.5 years compared with 1-time screening at age 37 months; however, the difference was only statistically significant for 1 of 2 definitions of amblyopia (interocular difference in acuity &ge;0.2 logMAR [logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution], 1.5% vs 2.7%; relative risk, 0.55 [95% CI, 0.29 to 1.04]; and interocular difference in acuity &ge;0.3 logMAR, 0.6% vs 1.8%; relative risk, 0.35 [95% CI, 0.15 to 0.86]).<sup>1,35</sup> The ALSPAC cohort study (n=6081) compared screening at age 37 months vs no screening and found no statistically significant difference in the prevalence of amblyopia at age 7.5 years for 3 definitions of amblyopia.<sup>1,36</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>ALSPAC had several limitations. A major limitation was the high overall attrition rate (about 55%) in both studies. Additional limitations included inadequate randomization and the inability to parse out the effects of earlier screening vs repeated screening. As a result, the USPSTF did not consider ALSPAC to be adequate direct evidence.<sup>1,35,36</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One fair-quality trial and 2 good-quality trials (n=417) of older preschool-aged children (mean age, 4 to 5 years) assessed the benefits of eye patching for the treatment of amblyopia or its risk factors.<sup>1,37-39</sup> There were no trials in children younger than 3 years. Two trials compared patching vs no patching (children were pretreated with eyeglasses if indicated in both groups).<sup>1,38,39</sup> One trial compared patching plus eyeglasses vs eyeglasses alone vs no treatment.<sup>1,37-39</sup> Study sample sizes ranged from 60 to 180 participants.<sup>1</sup> One of the 3 trials (evaluating patching plus eyeglasses vs eyeglasses alone vs no treatment) enrolled screen-detected children.<sup>1,37</sup> Treatment duration was 5 weeks, 12 weeks, and 1 year; follow-up duration was 1 year, 12 weeks, and 1.5 years, respectively.<sup>1,37</sup> Trials were conducted in the United States or the United Kingdom.<sup>1,37-39</sup> The trials reported best corrected visual acuity and improvement in visual acuity (secondary outcome).<sup>1,37-39</sup> Results could not be pooled, due to differences in study populations (eg, eligibility criteria and baseline visual acuity), outcome measures, comparisons, and length of follow-up.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Patching improved visual acuity in the amblyopic eye by an average of less than 1 line on the Snellen chart after 5 to 12 weeks among children with amblyopia risk factors who were pretreated with eyeglasses.<sup>1</sup> More children treated with patching experienced improvement of at least 2 lines on the Snellen chart than did children with no patching (45% vs 21%; p=0.003). Patching plus eyeglasses improved visual acuity by about 1 line on the logMAR chart after 1 year (0.11 logMAR [95% CI, 0.05 to 0.17]) among children with amblyopia risk factors not pretreated with eyeglasses.<sup>1</sup> Eyeglasses alone improved visual acuity by less than 1 line on the logMAR chart after 1 year (0.08 logMAR [95% CI, 0.02 to 0.15]) among children with amblyopia risk factors. Benefits were greater for children with more severe vision impairment at baseline. Children with worse baseline visual acuity had greater improvement with patching plus eyeglasses or eyeglasses alone.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Potential harms of vision screening in preschool-aged children include psychosocial effects such as labeling and anxiety, unnecessary referrals due to false-positive results, overdiagnosis, and unnecessary use of corrective lenses or treatments to prevent amblyopia. Studies of screening test accuracy (n=9723) found higher false-positive rates (usually &gt;75%) in populations with a lower prevalence (&lt;10%) of vision abnormalities, whereas studies in populations with a higher prevalence of vision abnormalities found lower false-positive rates (usually &lt;35%).<sup>1</sup> No studies reported measures of psychosocial distress, labeling, or anxiety. The ALSPAC prospective cohort study (n=4473) evaluated bullying behaviors among 8-year-olds in a subgroup of children treated with eye patching. The likelihood of experiencing bullying behaviors was lower among patched children offered screening at age 37 months than among those not screened (25.7% vs 47.1%; p=0.033; adjusted odds ratio, 0.39 [95% CI, 0.16 to 0.92]).<sup>1,36</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Potential harms of treatment include loss of visual acuity in the amblyopic eye, psychological harms (eg, effects on child happiness, behavioral problems, and parental concern or upset), inverse amblyopia, and patch allergy. One fair-quality trial and 2 good-quality trials (n=417) assessed treatment harms<sup>1,37-40</sup> and did not report similar outcomes. There were no trials in children younger than 3 years. None of the included studies evaluated treatment with atropine eye drops. One trial compared patching (n=87) vs no patching (n=93) and found that worsening visual acuity in the nonamblyopic eye did not differ between groups at 5 weeks (2.4% vs 6.8%; p=0.28).<sup>1,38</sup> One trial compared patching plus eyeglasses (n=59) vs eyeglasses alone (n=59) vs no treatment (n=59) and found no significant difference in loss of visual acuity in the amblyopic eye among treatment groups at 1 year.<sup>1,37</sup> In a subanalysis of 1 trial (patching plus eyeglasses vs eyeglasses alone vs no treatment), the psychological harms of treatment were evaluated in 144 of 177 study participants.<sup>1,37,40</sup> Few differences in child happiness or behavioral problems were observed between the treatment groups. More children were upset about treatment with patching than with eyeglasses alone (85% vs 29% at age 4 years; p=0.03; 62% vs 26% at age 5 years; p=0.005).<sup>1,40</sup> The study did not compare the eyeglasses and patching group with the nontreatment group for the psychological harms identified.<sup>1,40</sup> No participants experienced an adverse event (eg, inverse amblyopia or patch allergy) in 1 trial (n=60) comparing patching vs no patching.<sup>1,39</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that vision screening tools are accurate in detecting vision abnormalities. Accuracy did not clearly differ among preschool-aged children by age group. Treatment of amblyopia is associated with moderate improvements in visual acuity in children aged 3 to 5 years, which are likely to result in permanent improvements throughout life. The USPSTF concluded that the benefits are moderate because untreated amblyopia results in permanent, uncorrectable vision loss, and the benefits of screening and treatment can be experienced over a child&rsquo;s lifetime. The USPSTF found adequate evidence on harms of screening (ie, higher false-positive rates in low-prevalence populations). The USPSTF found adequate evidence to bound the potential harms of treatment as small. Therefore, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the overall net benefit is moderate for children aged 3 to 5 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trials that examined the benefits and harms of treatment did not enroll children younger than 3 years. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence that treatment of amblyopia or its risk factors in children younger than 3 years leads to improved vision outcomes or other benefits. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the harms of treatment in children younger than 3 years. Therefore, the USPSTF concludes that the benefits of screening to detect amblyopia or its risk factors in children younger than 3 years are uncertain, and that the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined for this age group.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Amblyopia is a functional reduction in visual acuity characterized by abnormal processing of visual images by the brain. It is associated with conditions that affect binocular vision, such as strabismus, anisometropia, and media opacity. The loss in visual acuity is unlikely to resolve spontaneously if left untreated. Therefore, screening in preschool-aged children seems to be consistent with the current biological understanding of amblyopia and the importance of detecting it during a critical period in children&rsquo;s development.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from February 28 to March 27, 2017. Some comments expressed concern about the scope of the review for screening. The USPSTF added language to clarify that the general eye examination to detect ocular abnormalities was not in scope for this review, and further clarified the language about screening tests in the Clinical Considerations section. Other comments expressed concern about the lack of information on health disparities. In response, the USPSTF added language about health disparities to the Clinical Considerations section. Some comments did not agree with delaying screening until the age of 3 years. The USPSTF added more language about the lack of evidence regarding screening and treatment in children younger than 3 years to the Discussion section. Last, some comments requested information about the effects of screening on learning and quality of life outcomes. The USPSTF revised the Research Needs and Gaps section, which discusses these gaps in the evidence on outcomes.</p><h2>Table 2.

It is the most common form of scoliosis and usually worsens during adolescence before skeletal maturity. In the United States, the estimated prevalence of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis with a Cobb angle of at least 10&deg; among children and adolescents aged 10 to 16 years is 1% to 3%.<sup>1, 2</sup> Most patients with a spinal curvature of greater than 40&deg; at skeletal maturity will likely experience curvature progression in adulthood. Severe spinal curvature may be associated with adverse long-term health outcomes (eg, pulmonary disorders, disability, back pain, psychological effects, cosmetic issues, and reduced quality of life).<sup>1, 3</sup> Therefore, early identification and effective treatment of mild scoliosis could slow or stop curvature progression before skeletal maturity, thereby improving long-term outcomes in adulthood.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Detection</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that currently available screening tests can accurately detect adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. The accuracy of screening was highest (93.8% sensitivity and 99.2% specificity) when 3 separate screening tests were used (eg, the forward bend test, scoliometer measurement, and Moir&eacute; topography); sensitivity was lower when screening programs used just 1 or 2 screening tests (eg, 71.1% for the forward bend test and scoliometer measurement and 84.4% for the forward bend test alone).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Intervention or Treatment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no direct evidence regarding the effect of screening for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis on patient-centered health outcomes. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the treatment of idiopathic scoliosis (Cobb angle &lt;50&deg; at diagnosis) in adolescents with exercise (2 small studies) or surgery (no studies) or its effects on health outcomes or the degree of spinal curvature in childhood or adulthood. The USPSTF found adequate evidence (5 studies) that treatment with bracing may decrease curvature progression in adolescents with mild or moderate curvature severity (an intermediate outcome). However, it found inadequate evidence on the association between reduction in spinal curvature in adolescence and long-term health outcomes in adulthood.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Harms of Early Detection and Intervention or Treatment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no studies on the direct harms of screening, such as psychological harms or harms associated with confirmatory radiography. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to determine the harms of treatment.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient and that the balance of benefits and harms of screening for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis cannot be determined.</p>","clinical":"<h2>Clinical Considerations</h2><h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This recommendation applies to asymptomatic children and adolescents aged 10 to 18 years. This recommendation does not apply to children and adolescents presenting for evaluation of back pain, breathing difficulties, abnormal radiography findings or other imaging studies, or obvious deformities in spinal curvature.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Most screening tests for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis are noninvasive. Screening is usually done by visual inspection of the spine to look for asymmetry of the shoulders, shoulder blades, and hips. In the United States, the forward bend test is commonly used to screen for idiopathic scoliosis. First, a clinician visually inspects the spine of a patient while the patient is standing upright. Next, the patient stands with feet together and bends forward at the waist with arms hanging and palms touching. The clinician repeats the visual inspection of the spine.<sup>1, 4</sup> A scoliometer, which measures the angle of trunk rotation, may be used during the forward bend test. An angle of trunk rotation of 5&deg; to 7&deg; is often the threshold for referral for radiography.<sup>1</sup> Other screening tests include a humpometer, the plumb line test, and Moir&eacute; topography (creating a 3-dimensional image of the surface of a patient&rsquo;s back) (<a href=\"#tab\">Table</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If idiopathic scoliosis is suspected, radiography is used to confirm the diagnosis and to quantify the degree of curvature (ie, the Cobb angle) and the Risser sign (the stage of ossification of the iliac apophysis).<sup>1</sup> US organizations that advocate screening recommend the forward bend test combined with scoliometer measurement.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Treatment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The goal of treatment is to decrease or stop progression of spinal curvature during the period of adolescent growth prior to skeletal maturity. Treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is determined by the degree of spinal curvature and the potential for further growth and generally includes observation, bracing, surgery, and exercise.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>\r\n\r\n<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Most children and adolescents with scoliosis do not have symptoms. Generally, smaller spinal curvatures remain stable, while larger curvatures tend to progress in severity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pulmonary dysfunction can be clinically significant in patients with spinal curvatures greater than 100&deg;; however, curvatures of that severity are rare. Back pain is more common, but its effect on functioning or disability is unclear.<sup>1</sup> Current evidence suggests that the presence of back pain does not necessarily correlate with the degree of spinal curvature in adulthood. Adults with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis may have poor self-reported health, appearance, and social interactions. Mortality is similar to that among unaffected adults.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Potential Harms</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Evidence on the harms of screening for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is limited. False-positive results are an important potential harm, with rates ranging from 0.8% to 21.5%.<sup>1, 5, 6</sup> However, the direct harms of screening are unclear. Potential harms of false-positive results include unnecessary follow-up visits, increased cancer risk attributable to radiation exposure, overtreatment, or psychosocial effects associated with the diagnosis of clinically nonsignificant scoliosis.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Current Practice</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Various organizations have recommended routine screening for scoliosis in children and adolescents since the 1980s.<sup>1, 4</sup> More than half of US states either mandate or recommend school-based screening for scoliosis.<sup>1, 4, 7</sup> Children and adolescents are usually screened with the forward bend test, with or without scoliometer measurement.<sup>1, 4</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In general, patients with a Cobb angle of less than 20&deg; are observed without treatment; however, exercise may be recommended at this time. Patients with a Cobb angle greater than 30&deg; or a Cobb angle of 20&deg; to 30&deg; that progresses 5&deg; or more over 3 to 6 months are treated with bracing. Patients with a Cobb angle of 40&deg; to 50&deg; may be treated with bracing or surgery, while those with a Cobb angle greater than 50&deg; typically require surgery.<sup>1</sup></p><h2>Other Considerations</h2><h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF identified several research gaps. Prospective, controlled screening studies that allow for comparison of screened and nonscreened populations and different screening settings, personnel, and procedures are needed. Good-quality studies with prospective identification of cohorts at the time of diagnosis (eg, from geographical areas with and without routine screening for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis) or treatment (eg, treated vs observed cohorts) for the purpose of long-term follow-up are important. High-quality studies on the potential harms of screening and treatment are also needed. Additional studies to help determine whether individual characteristics (eg, body mass index) may influence response to bracing treatment would be helpful. Studies on long-term outcomes are needed and should stratify results by degree of spinal curvature at diagnosis and at skeletal maturity. Better information on long-term outcomes such as pulmonary disorders, disability, back pain, psychological effects, cosmetic issues, and quality of life would be helpful. Good-quality studies on treatment with exercise, bracing, and surgery among screen-detected patients are needed. Studies conducted in primary care settings are also needed.</p><h2>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h2><p>This recommendation updates the 2004 USPSTF recommendation, in which the USPSTF recommended against routine screening for idiopathic scoliosis in asymptomatic adolescents (D recommendation).<sup>8</sup> In 2004, the USPSTF found fair evidence that treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis leads to health benefits (ie, decreased pain and disability) in a small proportion of persons. The USPSTF bounded the harms of treatment as moderate (eg, unnecessary brace wear or unnecessary referral to specialty care). Therefore, at that time, the USPSTF concluded that the harms of screening exceeded the potential benefits.<sup>8</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To update its recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a systematic review of the evidence. Because of new research, the USPSTF determined that it no longer has moderate certainty that the harms of treatment outweigh the benefits. The USPSTF found no direct evidence of a benefit of screening for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis on health outcomes. A growing body of evidence suggests that brace treatment can interrupt or slow scoliosis progression; however, evidence on whether reducing spinal curvature in adolescence has a long-term effect on health in adulthood is inadequate. Evidence on the effects of exercise and surgery on health or spinal curvature in childhood or adulthood is insufficient. Although the USPSTF previously found that treatment has moderate harms, a change in the analytic framework, outcomes, and applicability of older evidence resulted in the USPSTF assessing the evidence on harms of treatment as inadequate. As a result, the USPSTF has determined that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, leading the USPSTF to issue an I statement.</p>","other":"<h2>Recommendations of Others</h2><p>Several national specialty groups have published statements in support of screening. The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, the Scoliosis Research Society, the Pediatric Orthopaedic Society of North America, and the American Academy of Pediatrics advocate screening for scoliosis in girls at 10 and 12 years and once in male adolescents at 13 or 14 years as part of medical home preventive services, if screening is performed by well-trained screening personnel.<sup>26</sup> The UK National Screening Society does not recommend screening for scoliosis, given the uncertainty surrounding the effectiveness of screening and treatment.<sup>27</sup> However, the International Society on Scoliosis Orthopaedic and Rehabilitation Treatment recommends screening for idiopathic scoliosis through school-based programs, and that screening should be performed by clinicians who specialize in spinal deformities.<sup>28</sup></p>","discussion":"<h2>Discussion</h2><h3>Burden of Disease</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The prevalence of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (defined as a Cobb angle &ge;10&deg;) ranges from 1% to 3% among children and adolescents aged 10 to 16 years.<sup>1, 2</sup> Cumulative incidence estimates for spinal curvature of greater severity are 1.0% (Cobb angle &ge;20&deg;) and 0.4% (Cobb angle &ge;40&deg;). Prevalence varies by sex, ranging from 0.15% to 0.66% in boys and from 0.24% to 3.10% in girls.<sup>1</sup> Prevalence of scoliosis with a Cobb angle of 10&deg; is similar among girls and boys, but girls are 10 times more likely than boys to progress to a Cobb angle of 30&deg; or greater. Girls are also 5 times more likely than boys to have a Cobb angle of 20&deg; or greater.<sup>1</sup> The adverse effects of progressive scoliosis vary depending on its severity and include treatment costs, cosmetic deformity, reduced quality of life, disability, chronic back pain, social and psychological effects, functional limitations, and pulmonary disorders.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>To update its 2004 recommendation, the USPSTF reviewed the evidence on the benefits and harms of screening for and treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis.<sup>8</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening Tests</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Seven fair-quality observational studies assessed screening in adolescents (n=447,243).<sup>1</sup> Four studies evaluated the forward bend test with scoliometer measurement, 1 study evaluated the forward bend test with scoliometer measurement and Moir&eacute; topography, 1 study evaluated screening with a series of single, independent tests (forward bend test ,Moir&eacute; topography, scoliometer, or humpometer), and 1 study evaluated the forward bend test with a level plane and ruler. Studies were conducted in 7 different international sites, including 1 in the United States. Other countries included Singapore, Hong Kong, Greece, Ireland, and Norway. Six studies were conducted in school-based settings.<sup>1</sup> There was heterogeneity in the screening approaches, screening procedures, and training of the screeners (eg, orthopedists, nurses, and physical education teachers). Studies provided a limited description of screening populations and subgroups; 3 studies had follow-up data on children who screened negative. Five studies reported results of a single screening episode; 2 studies reported cumulative results of multiple years of repeated screening.<sup>1</sup> Studies used a Cobb angle of 10&deg; or greater of the major spinal curvature as the threshold for a diagnosis of scoliosis.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Screening accuracy improved with the number of CI screening tests used. Sensitivity and positive predictive value of screening programs varied based on whether a single or multiple screening tests were used and by the selected threshold for a positive screening result.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Sensitivity and Specificity</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Screening with a combination of the forward bend test, scoliometer measurement, and Moir&eacute; topography had the highest sensitivity (93.8% [95% CI, 93.3% to 94.3%]) and specificity (99.2% [95% CI, 99.2% to 99.2%]).<sup>9-11</sup> The forward bend test combined with scoliometer measurement had lower screening accuracy (71.1% sensitivity [95% CI, 54.1% to 84.6%] and 97.1% specificity [95% CI, 96.3% to 97.7%]).<sup>5</sup> The forward bend test alone had 84.4% sensitivity (95% CI, 67.2% to 94.7%) and 95.2% specificity (95% CI, 94.3% to 95.9%), the humpometer had 93.8% sensitivity (95% CI, 79.2% to 99.2%) and 78.5% specificity (95% CI, 76.9% to 80.0%), the scoliometer had 90.6% sensitivity (95% CI, 75.0% to 98.0%) and 80.7% specificity (95% CI, 79.1% to 82.1%), and Moir&eacute; topography had 100% sensitivity (95% CI, 84.2% to 100%) and 85.4% specificity (95% CI, 84.0% to 86.7%).<sup>6</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h4>False-Positive and False-Negative Results</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>One study evaluated screening with a combination of the forward bend test, scoliometer measurement, and Moir&eacute; topography and reported a low false-negative rate (6.2%) and the lowest false-positive rate (0.8%).<sup>1, 6, 11</sup> One study of the forward bend test combined with scoliometer measurement reported a 2.9% false-positive rate and a 28.9% false-negative rate.<sup>5</sup> Single screening tests were associated with the highest false-positive rates (forward bend test, 4.8% [15.6% false-negative rate]; scoliometer, 19.3% [9.4% false-negative rate]; Moir&eacute; topography, 14.6% [0% false-negative rate]; humpometer, 21.5% [6.3% false-negative rate]).<sup>1, 6</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Positive Predictive Value</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Screening with a combination of the forward bend test, scoliometer measurement, and Moir&eacute; topography had the highest positive predictive value (81.0% [95% CI, 80.3% to 81.7%]).<sup>9-11</sup> Positive predictive values for the forward bend test combined with scoliometer measurement ranged from 29.3% (95% CI, 20.3% to 39.8%)<sup>5</sup> to 54.1% (95% CI, 40.8% to 66.9%)<sup>12-14</sup> and from 5.0% (95% CI, 3.4% to 7.0%) to 17.3% (95% CI, 11.7% to 24.2%) for a single screening test (ie, humpometer or the forward bend test alone).<sup>1, 6</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Early Detection and Intervention or Treatment</h3>\r\n\r\n<h4>Bracing</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found 7 studies on the effectiveness of treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. Five studies (n=651) evaluated the effectiveness of 3 different types of braces. The 5 studies included 3 trials (1 fair-quality randomized clinical trial [RCT] and 1 fair-quality and 1 good-quality prospective controlled clinical trial [CCT] [n=347])<sup>15-18</sup> and 2 observational studies (1 good-quality prospective observational study and 1 fair-quality retrospective observational study [n=304]).<sup>19, 20</sup> Two trials were stopped early for observation of benefit. The good-quality prospective CCT began as an RCT but was changed to a patient preference controlled trial to boost enrollment after low acceptance of random assignment.<sup>1, 17, 18</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Studies included a comparison group that originally was not treated with bracing and had a prespecified clinical threshold for initiation of treatment. Three studies enrolled participants who had not previously received treatment for scoliosis; 2 studies did not provide details on prior treatment. Study sample sizes ranged from 37 to 242 participants. Studies were conducted in 5 countries (Canada, Sweden, United Kingdom, Ireland, and United States).<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Study participants were recruited from specialty orthopedic centers and school screening programs. Average age at study enrollment was 12 to 13 years. Race/ethnicity was inconsistently reported; in the 1 trial in which it was reported, 78% of participants were white. Most participants were female. Study participants had various types of scoliotic curvatures; curvature severity varied from a Cobb angle of about 20&deg; to 30&deg;. Eighty-five percent of participants had not reached skeletal maturity (defined as a Risser sign of 0 to 2).<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Three controlled prospective studies (n=345) suggested a benefit of treatment with bracing on slowing curvature progression of 5&deg; or 6&deg; compared with observed controls;<sup>3, 15, 16, 19</sup> 1 prospective study (n=37) and 1 retrospective study (n=64) showed limited differences in curvature progression of 10&deg; or more between treatment groups and observation control groups.<sup>3, 14, 16</sup> Four studies (n=411) evaluated curvature progression to a degree considered to be failure of treatment.<sup>11, 16, 20, 21</sup> The largest of these studies (n=242) demonstrated a significant benefit associated with bracing.<sup>17, 18</sup> The RCT (n=68) suggested less curvature progression in the treatment group but the significance was not reported.<sup>3, 15</sup> Two smaller studies (n=101) found similar results between treated and control populations.<sup>3, 12, 16</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The aforementioned large study (n=242) was a good-quality, international CCT (Bracing in Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis Trial [BrAIST]) that evaluated the effectiveness of bracing for 18 hours per day.<sup>18</sup> The study included a randomized cohort (n=116) and a preference cohort (n=126). The study conducted intention-to-treat and as-treated analyses. The rate of treatment success in the as-treated analysis (which included both cohorts) was 72% in the intervention group and 48% in the control group (odds ratio, 1.93 [95% CI, 1.08 to 3.46]).<sup>1, 3, 18</sup> In the intention-to-treat analysis (which included the randomized cohort only), the rate of treatment success was 75% in the intervention group and 42% in the control group (odds ratio, 4.11 [95% CI, 1.85 to 9.16]).<sup>1, 3, 18</sup> The number needed to treat to prevent 1 case of curvature progression past 50&deg; was 3.0 (95% CI, 2.0 to 6.2), and the reduction in relative risk with bracing was 56% (95% CI, 26 to 82).<sup>1, 3, 18</sup> BrAIST was the only study that reported quality-of-life outcomes associated with bracing; outcomes were similar between treatment groups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One study, the Scoliosis Research Society (SRS) bracing cohort, assessed Cobb angle in adulthood.<sup>19, 20</sup> Of the original 106 participants enrolled at 2 centers in the SRS bracing cohort, 77 were re-evaluated as adults (mean age, 32 years). The study demonstrated that the average Cobb angle at skeletal maturity was similar in the observed and treated groups (30.6&deg; vs 27.7&deg;, respectively; <em>P</em>=0.067). At follow-up in adulthood, the average Cobb angle had increased by an average of 4.4&deg; (SD, 4.1&deg;) in observed participants and by 6.4&deg; (SD, 5.8&deg;) in treated participants. Only 7.5% of observed participants and 5.4% of treated participants had curvature progression past 45&deg; at the time of follow-up (<em>P</em> &gt;0.99).<sup>1, 3</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Exercise</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Two Italian trials (n=184) evaluated the effectiveness of exercise treatment (tailored physiotherapeutic, scoliosis-specific exercise).<sup>21, 22</sup> The trials used control groups in which participants were assigned to an exercise program not designed to specifically treat scoliosis. Trial participants had a Cobb angle ranging from 10&deg; to 25&deg;; skeletal maturity ranged from a Risser sign of 0 to 3. Patients were older than 10 years.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the good-quality RCT (n=110)<sup>21</sup> and the fair-quality CCT (n=74),<sup>22</sup> the intervention group showed significant improvement compared with a generic exercise control group at the 12-month follow-up. In the RCT, intervention group participants had a Cobb angle reduction of 4.9&deg;, compared with an increase of 2.8&deg; in the control group (<em>P</em> &lt;0.001).<sup>1, 3, 21, 22</sup> Quality-of-life measures improved at 12 months in the intervention group compared with marginal improvements or unchanging measures in the control group. At the end of the 12-month treatment period in the CCT, the intervention group had a decrease of 0.67&deg; in average magnitude of all spinal curvatures compared with an increase of 1.38&deg; in the control group (<em>P</em> &lt;0.05).<sup>1, 3, 21, 22</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Surgery</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no studies of surgical treatment in screening-relevant populations that met inclusion criteria.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Association Between Adolescent Spinal Curvature Severity and Adult Health Outcomes</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no studies that directly addressed whether changes in the severity of spinal curvature in adolescence results in changes in adult health outcomes. The USPSTF found no studies that reported health outcomes stratified by degree of spinal curvature at skeletal maturity. Two fair-quality studies provided data on adult health outcomes, stratified by the type of treatment received in adolescence.<sup>1, 3, 23-25</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF considered 2 fair-quality retrospective observational long-term follow-up analyses (n=339) of adults diagnosed with idiopathic scoliosis in adolescence.<sup>1, 3, 23-25</sup> Adult outcomes were stratified by the type of treatment received in adolescence (bracing or surgery). Quality of life, as measured by the Scoliosis Research Society 22-Item (SRS-22) Patient Questionnaire or the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey, was not significantly different between observed and treated participants at follow-up in adulthood. No significant differences were found between braced and surgically treated participants in the Oswestry Disability Index or in general well-being, self-esteem, and social activity. Pulmonary and pregnancy outcomes were not significantly different between braced and surgically treated participants. However, braced participants rated their body appearance as more distorted than did untreated participants and reported more negative treatment experiences than those treated with surgery.<sup>1, 3, 23-25</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no studies on the direct harms of screening for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. False-positive rates ranged from 0.8% for the forward bend test combined with scoliometer measurement and Moir&eacute; topography to 21.5% for hump assessment alone. Potential harms associated with false-positive results include psychological harms, chest radiation, and other harms of unnecessary treatment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Potential harms of bracing include skin problems, body pain, physical limitations, anxiety, and depression. Complications of surgery include bleeding, infection, nerve damage, and death. The USPSTF found no studies that assessed the harms of treatment with surgery or exercise. Harms of bracing were reported in 1 good-quality study (n=242).<sup>17, 18</sup> In this RCT, intervention group participants were more likely to experience skin problems under the brace than control group participants (12/146 vs 0/96, respectively). Intervention group participants more commonly reported nonback body pain than control group participants (12/146 vs 2/96, respectively). The study reported low rates of anxiety and depression. Three of 146 participants in the intervention group reported anxiety and depression, compared with 1 of 96 participants in the control group. One of the intervention group participants reported a serious adverse event (anxiety and depression requiring hospitalization) compared with no participants in the control group. The intervention and control groups had similar rates of abnormal breast development, neurologic symptoms, and gastrointestinal or respiratory symptoms.<sup>17, 18</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no direct evidence on screening for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis and health outcomes. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that currently available screening tests can detect adolescent idiopathic scoliosis but no evidence on the harms of screening. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on treatment with exercise and surgery; it found adequate evidence that treatment with bracing may slow curvature progression in adolescents with mild or moderate curvature severity. However, the USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the association between reduction in spinal curvature in adolescence and long-term health outcomes in adulthood. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the harms of treatment. Therefore, the USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient and that the balance of benefits and harms of screening for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis cannot be determined.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Mild or moderate idiopathic scoliosis (ie, Cobb angle of &lt;40&deg; to 50&deg;) is often asymptomatic in adolescence. In addition, the majority of cases of scoliosis will not substantially progress during adolescence. The likelihood of progression in adulthood is small for persons with a spinal curvature of less than 30&deg; at skeletal maturity. However, there is no validated way to easily identify which cases of asymptomatic scoliosis will worsen during adolescence and lead to poor long-term outcomes.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from May 30 to June 26, 2017. Many comments expressed concern about the change in letter grade (from a D grade to an I statement). In response, the USPSTF added language in the &quot;Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation&quot; section to explain the change in grade. Some comments sought clarification of who the recommendation applies to. The USPSTF clarified this in the &ldquo;Patient Population Under Consideration&rdquo; section. Other comments expressed concern that the evidence needed to change the recommendation grade is unattainable. The USPSTF added language to address this in the &ldquo;Research Needs and Gaps&rdquo; section.</p><h2>Table.

In the United States, the lifetime risk of being diagnosed with prostate cancer is approximately 11%, and the lifetime risk of dying of prostate cancer is 2.5%.<sup>1</sup> Many men with prostate cancer never experience symptoms and, without screening, would never know they have the disease. In autopsy studies of men who died of other causes, more than 20% of men aged 50 to 59 years and more than 33% of men aged 70 to 79 years were found to have prostate cancer.<sup>2</sup> In some men, the cancer is more aggressive and leads to death. The median age of death from prostate cancer is 80 years, and more than two-thirds of all men who die of prostate cancer are older than 75 years.<sup>1</sup> African American men have an increased lifetime risk of prostate cancer death compared with those of other races/ethnicities (4.2% for African American men, 2.9% for Hispanic men, 2.3% for white men, and 2.1% for Asian and Pacific Islander men).<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Detection</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Screening for prostate cancer begins with a test that measures the amount of PSA protein in the blood. An elevated PSA level may be caused by prostate cancer but can also be caused by other conditions, including an enlarged prostate (benign prostatic hyperplasia) and inflammation of the prostate (prostatitis). Some men without prostate cancer may therefore have positive screening results (ie, &ldquo;false-positive&rdquo; results). Men with a positive PSA test result may undergo a transrectal ultrasound-guided core-needle biopsy of the prostate to diagnose prostate cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The goal of screening for prostate cancer is to identify high-risk, localized prostate cancer that can be successfully treated, thereby preventing the morbidity and mortality associated with advanced or metastatic prostate cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adequate evidence from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) shows that PSA-based screening programs in men aged 55 to 69 years may prevent approximately 1.3 deaths from prostate cancer over approximately 13 years per 1000 men screened.<sup>3, 4</sup> Screening programs may also prevent approximately 3 cases of metastatic prostate cancer per 1000 men screened.<sup>3</sup> Current results from screening trials show no reductions in all-cause mortality from screening. There is inadequate evidence to assess whether the benefits for African American men and men with a family history of prostate cancer aged 55 to 69 years are different than the benefits for the average-risk population. There is also inadequate evidence to assess whether there are benefits to starting screening in these high-risk groups before age 55 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adequate evidence from RCTs is consistent with no benefit of PSA-based screening for prostate cancer on prostate cancer mortality in men 70 years and older.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Harms of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The harms of screening for prostate cancer include harms from the PSA screening test and subsequent harms from diagnosis and treatment. Potential harms of screening include frequent false-positive results and psychological harms. One major trial in men screened every 2 to 4 years concluded that, over 10 years, more than 15% of men experienced at least 1 false-positive test result.<sup>5</sup> Harms of diagnostic procedures include complications of prostate biopsy, such as pain, hematospermia (blood in semen or ejaculate), and infection. Approximately 1% of prostate biopsies result in complications requiring hospitalization. The false-positive and complication rates from biopsy are higher in older men.<sup>3</sup> Adequate evidence suggests that the harms of screening and diagnostic procedures are at least small.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PSA-based screening for prostate cancer leads to the diagnosis of prostate cancer in some men whose cancer would never have become symptomatic during their lifetime. Treatment of these men results in harms and provides them with no benefit. This is known as overdiagnosis, and follow-up of large randomized trials suggests that 20% to 50% of men diagnosed with prostate cancer through screening may be overdiagnosed.<sup>3</sup> Overdiagnosis rates would be expected to increase with age and to be highest in men 70 years and older because older men have high risk of death from competing causes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Harms of prostate cancer treatment include erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence, and bothersome bowel symptoms. About 1 in 5 men who undergo radical prostatectomy develop long-term urinary incontinence requiring use of pads, and 2 in 3 men will experience long-term erectile dysfunction. More than half of men who receive radiation therapy experience long-term sexual erectile dysfunction and up to 1 in 6 men experience long-term bothersome bowel symptoms, including bowel urgency and fecal incontinence.<sup>3</sup> Adequate evidence suggests that the harms of overdiagnosis and treatment are at least moderate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adequate evidence shows that the harms of screening in men older than 70 years are at least moderate and greater than in younger men because of increased risk of false-positive results, harms from diagnostic biopsy, and harms from treatment.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>PSA-based screening for prostate cancer has both potential benefits and harms. The USPSTF does not recommend screening for prostate cancer unless men express a preference for screening after being informed of and understanding the benefits and risks. The decision about whether to be screened for prostate cancer requires that each man incorporate his own values about the potential benefits and harms. The potential harms of screening, diagnostic procedures, and treatment occur soon after screening takes place. Although the potential benefits may occur any time after screening, they generally occur years after treatment, because progression from asymptomatic, screen-detected cancer to symptomatic, metastasized cancer or death (if it occurs at all) may take years or decades to occur.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the net benefit of PSA-based screening for prostate cancer in men aged 55 to 69 years is small for some men. How each man weighs specific benefits and harms will determine whether the overall net benefit is small.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the potential benefits of PSA-based screening for prostate cancer in men 70 years and older do not outweigh the expected harms.</p>","clinical":"<h2>Clinical Considerations</h2><h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This recommendation applies to adult men in the general US population without symptoms or a previous diagnosis of prostate cancer. It also applies to men at increased risk of death from prostate cancer because of race/ethnicity or family history of prostate cancer. The sections below provide more information on how this recommendation applies to African American men and men with a family history of prostate cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Risk Assessment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Older age, African American race, and family history of prostate cancer are the most important risk factors for the development of prostate cancer. Other factors with weaker associations and less evidence include diets high in fat and low in vegetable consumption. Cigarette smoking is associated with higher risk of prostate cancer mortality.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Screening</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>PSA-based screening is the usual method of screening and has been studied in several large trials. Although new screening methods are being developed (such as single- and adjusted-threshold testing and PSA velocity and doubling time), evidence is insufficient to support one method of PSA-based screening over another. Evidence is also insufficient that using a prebiopsy risk calculator, with or without measurement of free PSA levels, or using genetic or adjunctive imaging tests meaningfully changes the potential benefits and harms of screening. This is an important area of current research that has the potential to decrease the harms of PSA-based screening for prostate cancer. The use of digital rectal examination as a screening modality is not recommended because there is a lack of evidence on the benefits; digital rectal examination was either eliminated from or not included in the major screening trials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PSA-based screening for prostate cancer has been studied in 3 very large RCTs, each with at least a decade of median follow-up: the US-based Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial, the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC), and the Cluster Randomized Trial of PSA Testing for Prostate Cancer (CAP). These trials used varying screening intervals (from 1-time screening to every 1 to 4 years) and PSA thresholds (2.5 to 10.0 ng/mL) for diagnostic biopsy.<sup>3</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The PLCO trial may be viewed as a trial of organized vs opportunistic screening for prostate cancer because of the substantial screening rate in the control group and the high screening rate among men in both the control and intervention groups prior to study enrollment.<sup>6</sup> Men in the intervention group were screened more often than men in the control group, and more men in the intervention group were diagnosed with prostate cancer than in the control group. The trial found no difference between groups in death from prostate cancer after almost 15 years of follow-up (absolute risk, 4.8 per 1000 person-years in the intervention group vs 4.6 per 1000 person-years in the control group; relative risk [RR], 1.04 [95% CI, 0.87-1.24]).<sup>7</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the ERSPC trial, the results suggest that, overall, the number needed to screen is 781 men aged 55 to 69 years at enrollment (95% CI, 490-1929) to prevent 1 man from dying of prostate cancer after 13 years. The results varied across the individual ERSPC sites, and prostate cancer mortality was significantly reduced only at the sites in the Netherlands and Sweden. However, point estimates were in favor of screening at all sites except Switzerland. At the largest site (Finland), there was no significant benefit observed for prostate cancer mortality (rate ratio, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.75-1.10]), and in Sweden there was an absolute risk reduction of 0.72% (95% CI, 0.50%-0.94%), a 42% relative reduction.<sup>8-10</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Four ERSPC trial sites reported data on the effect of PSA-based screening for prostate cancer on the development of metastatic cancer after 12 years of follow-up. The risk of developing metastatic prostate cancer was 30% lower among men randomized to screening than among men in the control group (absolute risk, 7.05 per 1000 men in the screening group vs 10.14 per 1000 men in the control group [calculated from numbers in the study]). This translates to an absolute reduction in the long-term risk of metastatic prostate cancer of 3.1 cases per 1000 men screened.<sup>11</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The CAP trial was a cluster-randomized trial of a single invitation to PSA-based screening in the United Kingdom among 415,357 men. Overall, 34% of invited men received a valid PSA screening test. After a median follow-up of 10 years, there was no significant difference in prostate cancer mortality between the invited group and the control group (absolute risk, 0.30 per 1000 person-years vs 0.31 per 1000 person-years, respectively).<sup>12</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on clinical stage, tumor grade, and PSA level, prostate cancer is classified as low, medium, or high risk for clinical progression and prostate cancer death. Although treatment is thought to be most immediately beneficial for men with high- and medium-risk prostate cancer, the vast majority of cases of screen-detected cancer are low risk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As with all screening tests, some men without prostate cancer will receive positive PSA test results (ie, &ldquo;false-positive&rdquo; results). The false-positive rate for the PSA test depends on the PSA threshold used. Among 5 ERSPC sites that reported the false-positive rate, approximately 1 in 6 men screened at least once had 1 or more false-positive results, and of the positive results in the first round of screening, two-thirds were false positives. In Sweden, where a low PSA threshold (3.0 ng/mL) was used to determine a positive test result and men were screened every 2 years, more than 45% of men who participated in all screening rounds had a false-positive result over 10 years of screening.<sup>5</sup> In the PLCO trial, more than two-thirds of men who underwent a prostate biopsy because of a positive PSA test result were found not to have prostate cancer.<sup>13</sup> In addition to false-positive results, there are other harms associated with screening and subsequent diagnostic evaluation; biopsies may result in pain, fever, hematospermia, and hospitalization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 3 large RCTs on screening predominantly included men aged 55 to 69 years. There is inadequate evidence on starting screening at a younger age in the average-risk population or to obtain a baseline PSA level. Evidence in men 70 years and older does not support routine screening because of the lack of trial evidence of benefit, the low likelihood of benefit given the time to realize benefit, and the increased risk of harms from false-positive results, biopsies, overdiagnosis, and treatment. Although the evidence does not support routine screening in all men older than 70 years, the USPSTF recognizes the common use of PSA-based screening in practice today and understands that some older men will continue to request screening and some clinicians will continue to offer it. Men older than 70 years who request screening should be aware of the reduced likelihood of benefit from screening and the increased risk of false-positive test results and complications of diagnosis and treatment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF considered whether there are screening and follow-up approaches that increase the potential for benefit while reducing the potential for harms. Variation across sites in randomized trials of screening suggests there may be greater mortality benefit from screening every other year compared with longer intervals and from using lower PSA thresholds for diagnostic biopsy. Although these approaches may have increased the potential benefit reported in studies, they also resulted in substantially more harms&mdash;more false-positive results, more prostate biopsies, and more cases of overdiagnosis. This trade-off was also observed in a review of decision analysis models; screening protocols using lower PSA thresholds (&lt;4.0 ng/mL) for biopsy and more frequent screening intervals offered greater potential reductions in prostate cancer mortality but higher rates of overdiagnosis and other harms.<sup>14</sup> The frequency of screening in the ERSCP sites ranged from every 2 to 7 years. No ERSPC trial site offered screening more often than every 2 years, and many sites screened every 4 years. The PSA threshold for biopsy in the ERSCP sites ranged from 2.5 to 4 ng/mL (except for 10 ng/mL in the earlier years at the Belgium site). In the G&ouml;teborg, Sweden, site, which reported the largest benefit, the frequency of screening was every 2 years, and the threshold for biopsy was 2.5 ng/mL (3.0 ng/mL in the first few years of the study).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Treatment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The potential benefit of screening for prostate cancer is because of treatment. Thus, it is important for men to consider both the potential benefits and harms of treatment (including active surveillance) as they consider whether to be screened. Men not able or willing to tolerate treatment should not be screened for prostate cancer. Because most cases of prostate cancer advance very slowly, if at all, the 10-year survival rate for screen-detected, localized prostate cancer is very high. In a recent major trial that enrolled more than 1500 men randomized to receive either active treatment or active surveillance, the 10-year survival rate in all groups was 99%.<sup>15</sup> The good prognosis for early-stage prostate cancer makes it difficult to study the effectiveness of treatment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Multiple treatment options exist for prostate cancer, and new ones are being developed. In current practice, the 3 most common treatment options for men with screen-detected, localized prostate cancer are surgical removal of the prostate gland (radical prostatectomy), radiation therapy (external-beam radiation therapy, proton beam therapy, or brachytherapy), and active surveillance. The USPSTF considered available evidence on treatment when evaluating the effectiveness of screening and found that current evidence suggests that treatment of early-stage, screen-detected prostate cancer with radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy likely reduces risk of clinical progression and metastatic disease and may reduce prostate cancer mortality. More details about the effectiveness and adverse effects of active treatment are provided in the Discussion section.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Active surveillance is a treatment approach that seeks to limit the harms of treatment by allowing men with apparent low-risk prostate cancer to forego surgery or radiation in favor of ongoing monitoring of their cancer. Although protocols vary, active surveillance usually includes regular, repeated PSA testing and often repeated digital rectal examination and prostate biopsy, with potential for exposure to repeated harms from biopsies. Men whose cancer is found to be changing are offered definitive treatment with surgery or radiation therapy. Other treatment monitoring strategies for men with low-risk cancer exist (for example, watchful waiting) and also vary in protocol. Active surveillance has become a more common treatment choice in the United States over the past several years. In a study assessing community-based urology practice in the United States between 2010 and 2013, about half of men with low-risk prostate cancer were treated with radical prostatectomy. The active surveillance rate, however, increased from about 10% in 2005-2009 to 40.4% in 2010-2013 among men with low-risk prostate cancer.<sup>16</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Active treatment of prostate cancer can result in major adverse effects. About 3 in 1000 men die during or soon after radical prostatectomy, and about 50 in 1000 men have serious surgical complications requiring intervention. About 1 in 5 men who undergo radical prostatectomy develop long-term urinary incontinence requiring regular use of pads, and about 2 in 3 men experience long-term erectile dysfunction. More than half of men who receive radiation therapy experience long-term erectile dysfunction, and up to 1 in 6 men experience long-term bothersome bowel symptoms, including bowel urgency and fecal incontinence.<sup>3</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Screening for Prostate Cancer in African American Men</h3>\r\n\r\n<h4>Burden</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>In the United States, African American men are more likely to develop prostate cancer than white men (203.5 vs 121.9 cases per 100,000 men). African American men are also more than twice as likely as white men to die of prostate cancer (44.1 vs 19.1 deaths per 100,000 men).<sup>1</sup> The higher death rate is attributable in part to an earlier age at cancer onset, more advanced cancer stage at diagnosis, and higher rates of more aggressive cancer (ie, higher tumor grade). These differences in death from prostate cancer may also reflect that African American men have lower rates of receiving high-quality care.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Available Evidence</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF searched for evidence about the potential benefits and harms of PSA-based screening for prostate cancer in African American men.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Potential Benefits</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The PLCO trial enrolled 4% African American men, which is not enough to determine whether the overall trial results differed for African American men.<sup>17</sup> The ERSPC trial did not record or report any race-specific subgroup information. The low proportion of persons of African descent in European countries during the study period makes it likely that these groups were not well represented.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Potential Harms</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>An analysis from the PLCO trial found that African American men were significantly more likely to have major infections after prostate biopsy than white men (odds ratio [OR], 7.1 [95% CI, 2.7-18.0]).<sup>13</sup> Evidence is insufficient to compare the risk of false-positive results, potential for overdiagnosis, and magnitude of harms from prostate cancer treatment in African American vs other men.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Advising African American Men</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on the available evidence, the USPSTF is not able to make a separate, specific recommendation on PSA-based screening for prostate cancer in African American men. Although it is possible that screening may offer greater benefits for African American men compared with the general population, currently no direct evidence demonstrates whether this is true. Screening, and subsequent diagnosis and treatment, has the potential to increase exposure to potential harms. Decision analysis models suggest that given the higher rates of aggressive prostate cancer in African American men, PSA-based screening may provide greater benefit to African American men than the general population. These models also suggest a potential mortality benefit for African American men when beginning screening before age 55 years. The USPSTF believes that a reasonable approach for clinicians is to inform African American men about their increased risk of developing and dying of prostate cancer as well as the potential benefits and harms of screening so they can make an informed, personal decision about whether to be screened. Although the USPSTF found inadequate evidence about how benefits may differ for African American men, it recognizes the epidemiologic data showing that African American men may develop prostate cancer at younger ages than average-risk men and understands that some African American men and their clinicians will continue to screen at younger ages. The USPSTF does not recommend screening for prostate cancer in men, including African American men, older than 70 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF strongly encourages research on screening for and treatment of prostate cancer in African American men. It is important to consider both the potential additional benefits and harms to fully understand the value of screening. Studies are needed to confirm that African American men who undergo screening receive similar or greater reductions in prostate cancer mortality compared with men in the general population, as well as to explore the optimal screening frequency and whether beginning screening before age 55 years provides additional benefits in African American men. Studies are also needed to better understand strategies to mitigate harms and maximize benefits of screening, diagnostic follow-up, and treatment (including active surveillance) in African American men. It is also important that research and quality improvement activities continue to work to eliminate disparities in access to high-quality care for men with prostate cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Screening for Prostate Cancer in Men With a Family History</h3>\r\n\r\n<h4>Burden</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The introduction of PSA-based screening for prostate cancer has substantially altered the epidemiologic data for prostate cancer, greatly increasing the number of men with a diagnosis of prostate cancer and thus also the number of men with a father, brother, or son with a history of prostate cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Available Evidence</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>It is generally accepted that men with a family history of prostate cancer are more likely to develop prostate cancer. A study of twins in Scandinavia estimated that genetic factors may account for up to 42% of prostate cancer risk.<sup>18</sup> An analysis from the Finnish site of the ERSPC trial concluded that men with at least 1 first-degree relative with prostate cancer were 30% more likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer than men without a family history.<sup>19</sup> Men with 3 first-degree relatives with prostate cancer or 2 close relatives on the same side of the family with prostate cancer diagnosed before age 55 years may have an inheritable form of prostate cancer associated with genetic changes passed down from one generation to the next. This type of prostate cancer is thought to account for less than 10% of all prostate cancer cases.<sup>20</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF searched for evidence about the potential benefits and harms of PSA-based screening for prostate cancer in men with a family history of prostate cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Potential Benefits</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Of the 7% of men in the PLCO trial who reported a family history of prostate cancer on a baseline questionnaire, prostate cancer mortality was lower among white men in the intervention group than in the control group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.49 [95% CI, 0.22-1.10]; <em>P</em> = 0.08),<sup>21</sup> but the difference was not significant and the confidence interval was wide.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Potential Harms</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>No studies have assessed the risk of harms related to screening for, diagnosis of, or treatment of prostate cancer based on family history of prostate cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Advising Men With a Family History of Prostate Cancer</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on the available evidence, the USPSTF is not able to make a separate, specific recommendation on PSA-based screening for prostate cancer in men with a family history of prostate cancer. Although it is possible that screening may offer additional potential benefits for these men compared with the general population, screening also has the potential to increase exposure to potential harms, especially among men with relatives whose cancer was overdiagnosed. Men who have a first-degree relative who had advanced prostate cancer at diagnosis, developed metastatic prostate cancer, or died of prostate cancer are probably the most likely to benefit from screening. The USPSTF believes that a reasonable approach for clinicians is to inform men with a family history of prostate cancer, particularly those with multiple first-degree relatives with prostate cancer, about their increased risk of developing cancer as well as the potential earlier age at disease onset. This discussion should include the potential benefits and harms of screening for prostate cancer so these men have the opportunity to make an informed, personal decision about whether to be screened. Although the USPSTF found inadequate evidence about how benefits may differ for men with a family history of prostate cancer, it recognizes the epidemiologic data showing that these men are at a greater than average risk and understands that some men and their clinicians will continue to screen at younger ages in men with a family history. The USPSTF does not recommend screening for prostate cancer in men, including men with a family history of prostate cancer, older than 70 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Epidemiologic studies examining outcomes in men with relatives who died of prostate cancer vs men with relatives diagnosed with prostate cancer who died of other causes may help provide better guidance. Studies are needed that explore the optimal screening frequency and whether beginning screening before age 55 years provides additional benefits for men with a family history of prostate cancer. Additional research is also needed to help identify men with an inheritable form of prostate cancer and to understand how the potential benefits and harms of screening, including screening intervals and starting ages, may differ in these men compared with the general population.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many areas in need of research to improve screening for and treatment of prostate cancer, including</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Comparing different screening strategies, including different screening intervals, to fully understand the effects on benefits and harms</li>\r\n\t<li>Developing, validating, and providing longer-term follow-up of screening and diagnostic techniques, including risk stratification tools, use of baseline PSA level as a risk factor, and use of non&ndash;PSA-based adjunctive tests that can distinguish nonprogressive and slowly progressive cancer from cancer that is likely to become symptomatic and affect quality or length of life, to reduce overdiagnosis and overtreatment</li>\r\n\t<li>Screening for and treatment of prostate cancer in African American men, including understanding the potential benefits and harms of different starting ages and screening intervals and the use of active surveillance; given the large disparities in prostate cancer mortality in African American men, this should be a national priority</li>\r\n\t<li>How to better inform men with a family history of prostate cancer about the benefits and harms of PSA-based screening for prostate cancer, including the potential differences in outcomes between men with relatives who died of prostate cancer and men with relatives diagnosed with prostate cancer who died of other causes</li>\r\n\t<li>How to refine active prostate cancer treatments to minimize harms</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>How to better understand patient values about the known benefits and harms of screening for and treatment of prostate cancer; how these values influence men&rsquo;s assessment of the overall benefit vs harm; how to best implement informed decision making programs that incorporate the values and preferences of men and their families about screening; how to adapt the informed decision-making process to a range of diverse patient populations as screening, diagnosis, and treatment strategies evolve; and the effects of informed decision making on health outcomes and patient experience</p><h2>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h2><p>This recommendation replaces the 2012 USPSTF recommendation<sup>38</sup> on PSA-based screening for prostate cancer. In 2012, the USPSTF concluded that, although there are potential benefits of screening for prostate cancer, these benefits do not outweigh the expected harms enough to recommend routine screening (D recommendation). The change in recommendation grade is based in part on additional evidence that increased the USPSTF&rsquo;s certainty about the reductions in risk of dying of prostate cancer and risk of metastatic disease. Longer-term follow-up of the ERSPC trial and from some ERSPC trial sites found that PSA-based screening for prostate cancer prevents 1.28 men from dying of prostate cancer for every 1000 men screened. In addition, a subset of ERSPC trial sites have since reported that screening 1000 men aged 55 to 69 years may prevent approximately 3 men from developing metastatic prostate cancer. Longer-term, 12.7-year results of the PIVOT trial became available since the posting of the draft recommendation statement and are similar to the 10-year results. Studies continue to demonstrate the harms of PSA-based screening, including false-positive results, complications from transrectal prostate biopsies, overdiagnosis (which may occur in 20%-50% of cases of screen-detected cancer, based on estimates from trial data), psychological harms, and harms of treatment, including urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction. The change in recommendation grade further reflects new evidence about and increased use of active surveillance of low-risk prostate cancer, which may reduce the risk of subsequent harms from screening. This recommendation also clearly identifies African American men and men with a family history of prostate cancer as having higher risk for prostate cancer and provides additional information to help support these men in making informed decisions about screening. For the C recommendation for men aged 55 to 69 years, the USPSTF&rsquo;s intention is to convey that each man&rsquo;s values may shift the balance to a net benefit of screening and to promote the importance of informed decision making prior to screening. The USPSTF continues to find that the benefits of screening do not outweigh the harms in men 70 years and older and recommends against screening in these men.</p>","other":"<h2>Recommendations of Others</h2><p>The American Academy of Family Physicians<sup>39</sup> and the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care<sup>40</sup> recommend against PSA-based screening for prostate cancer. The American College of Physicians<sup>41</sup> recommends that clinicians discuss the benefits and harms of screening with men aged 50 to 69 years and only recommends screening for men who prioritize screening and have a life expectancy of more than 10 to 15 years. The American Urological Association<sup>42</sup> recommends that men aged 55 to 69 years with a life expectancy of more than 10 to 15 years be informed of the benefits and harms of screening and engage in shared decision making with their clinicians, taking into account each man&rsquo;s values and preferences. It notes that to reduce the harms of screening, the screening interval should be 2 or more years. The American Urological Association also notes that decisions about screening, including potentially starting screening before age 55 years, should be individual ones for African American men and men with a family history of prostate cancer. The American Cancer Society<sup>43</sup> adopted detailed screening recommendations in 2016 that highlight the importance of shared decision making and the need for informed discussion of the uncertainties, risks, and potential benefits of screening. It recommends conversations about screening beginning at age 50 years and earlier for African American men and men with a father or brother with a history of prostate cancer before age 65 years.</p>","discussion":"<h2>Discussion</h2><h3>Burden of Disease</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>For men in the United States, the lifetime risk of being diagnosed with prostate cancer is approximately 11%, and the lifetime risk of dying of prostate cancer is 2.5%.<sup>1</sup> In 2013, the most recent year for which data are available, approximately 172,000 men in the United States were diagnosed with prostate cancer and almost 28,000 died of prostate cancer.<sup>22</sup> From 2003 to 2012, the prostate cancer mortality rate among US men decreased significantly by 3.4% per year (3.3% and 3.9% per year in white and black men, respectively).<sup>23</sup> Most cases of prostate cancer found in autopsy studies are microscopic, well-differentiated lesions that did not affect men&rsquo;s health during their lifetime. Data from screening trials suggest that many cases of low-risk cancer detected by screening would never have caused symptoms or affected men&rsquo;s health had they never been identified through screening.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>To update its 2012 recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a systematic review of the evidence regarding the benefits and harms of PSA-based screening for prostate cancer and subsequent treatment of screen-detected prostate cancer.<sup>3, 4</sup> The USPSTF also commissioned a review of multiple contextual questions, including a review of existing decision analysis models and what they suggest about the potential for mitigating the harms of screening and treatment and the overdiagnosis rate of PSA-based screening.<sup>14,24</sup> The commissioned reviews also examined the effectiveness and harms of PSA-based screening in patient subpopulations at higher risk of prostate cancer, including older men, African American men, and men with a family history of prostate cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Early Detection</h3>\r\n\r\n<h4>Potential Benefits of Screening</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>To understand the potential benefits of PSA-based screening for prostate cancer, the USPSTF examined the results of the ERSPC, PLCO, and CAP trials and site-specific reports from 4 ERSPC trial sites. To understand the effectiveness of treatment of screen-detected, early-stage prostate cancer, the USPSTF also examined the results of 3 randomized trials and 9 cohort studies.<sup>3</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ERSPC trial randomly assigned a core group of more than 160,000 men aged 55 to 69 years from 7 European countries to PSA-based screening vs usual care.<sup>8</sup> Four ERSPC sites reported on the cumulative incidence of metastatic prostate cancer. After a median follow-up of 12 years, the risk of developing metastatic prostate cancer was 30% lower among men randomized to screening compared with usual care (RR, 0.70 [95% CI, 0.60-0.82]; <em>P</em> = 0.001). The absolute reduction in long-term risk of metastatic prostate cancer associated with screening was 3.1 cases per 1000 men.<sup>11</sup> After a median follow-up of 13 years, the prostate cancer mortality rate among men aged 55 to 69 years was 4.3 deaths per 10,000 person-years in the screening group and 5.4 deaths per 10,000 person-years in the usual care group (RR, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.69-0.91]; <em>P</em> = 0.001).<sup>8</sup> The ERSPC trial did not find a reduction in all-cause mortality.<sup>8</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The results of the overall ERSPC trial provide some of the most important evidence about the potential benefits of PSA-based screening for prostate cancer. The trial was rated as fair quality by the USPSTF review because of several important methodologic issues, including observed differences in how men in the screening and control groups were treated for prostate cancer. Among men diagnosed with nonmetastatic prostate cancer, a greater proportion of men in the screening group underwent radical prostatectomy (41.3%) than in the usual care group (32.8%).<sup>25</sup> Although one might expect treatment differences by screening group if screening produces a shift toward more localized clinical stages, treatment differences across ERSPC study groups persisted even with stratification by clinical stage and tumor grade. The cause for these differences is not known.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the prostate component of the PLCO trial, more than 76,000 men aged 55 to 74 years were randomized to either annual PSA-based screening for 6 years or usual care. Abnormal screening results (PSA level &gt;4.0 ng/mL or abnormal digital rectal examination findings) were forwarded to patients and their primary care clinician, who coordinated further diagnostic evaluation.<sup>17</sup> The majority of men were non-Hispanic white (86.2% and 83.8% of the screening and control groups, respectively). Approximately one-third of men in both groups had either a PSA test or digital rectal examination within the 3 years prior to enrollment. An estimated 78% of men in the control group had a PSA test during the screening phase of the trial.<sup>25</sup> On average, men in the intervention group received 5 PSA tests during the screening phase of the trial and men in the usual care group received 3 PSA tests.<sup>26</sup> This high PSA testing rate in the control group limits the study&rsquo;s ability to identify a potential screening benefit. Despite the common use of PSA testing in the control group, after 13 years more cases of prostate cancer were diagnosed in the screening group than in the control group (108.4 vs 97.1 cases per 10,000 person-years, respectively) (RR, 1.12 [95% CI, 1.07-1.17]). At a median follow-up of 14.8 years in the PLCO trial, the prostate cancer mortality rate was not significantly different between the intervention and control group (4.8 vs 4.6 deaths per 10,000 person-years, respectively) (RR, 1.04 [95% CI, 0.87-1.24]).<sup>7</sup> This result does not rule out the possibility of a reduction in prostate cancer mortality from screening for prostate cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The CAP trial was a cluster randomized trial in the United Kingdom among 415,357 men aged 50 to 69 years invited for a single PSA-based screening for prostate cancer.<sup>12</sup> Men with a PSA level of 3.0 ng/mL or greater were referred for biopsy. Men with localized prostate cancer were offered enrollment into the Prostate Testing for Cancer and Treatment (ProtecT) trial, in which the primary outcome was prostate cancer mortality. At intervention sites, 34% of men received a valid PSA screening test; the percentage of men at control sites who received a PSA test for screening purposes was estimated to be about 10% to 15% over 10 years. After a median follow-up of 10 years, there was no significant difference in prostate cancer mortality between the group of men invited to screening and control group (RR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.94-1.03]; <em>P</em> = 0.49).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Neither the ERSPC, PLCO, or CAP trials, nor any of the ERSPC site-specific analyses, found an overall all-cause mortality benefit from screening for prostate cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are limited data on the benefit of screening in younger men. The PLCO trial did not recruit men younger than 55 years. The ERSPC trial reported a slightly higher and nonsignificant risk reduction (RR, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.28-2.49]) for prostate cancer mortality in men aged 50 to 55 years compared with men in the core group aged 55 to 69 years (RR, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.69-0.91]).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are few data that screening is effective in men older than 70 years. The PLCO and ERSPC trials enrolled men 74 years and younger; men older than 70 years were not in the core age group (55-69 years) in the ERSPC trial. The CAP trial did not enroll men older than 69 years. In the ERSPC trial, the prostate cancer mortality rate ratio in the screening vs control group among men 70 years and older at randomization was 1.17 (95% CI, 0.82-1.66); however, a statistical test found no significant heterogeneity across age groups. In the PLCO trial, the analogous rate ratio at a median follow-up of 13 years among men aged 65 to 74 years at randomization was 1.02 (95% CI, 0.77-1.37); the test for heterogeneity was not significant (<em>P</em> = 0.81).</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Potential Benefits of Treatment</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF examined 3 good-quality randomized trials of treatment of localized prostate cancer and 9 observational cohort studies to understand the potential benefit of active treatment (radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy) compared with conservative treatment (active surveillance or watchful waiting) on overall mortality, prostate cancer mortality, and progression to metastatic prostate cancer.<sup>3</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The UK ProtecT trial randomized more than 1600 men aged 50 to 69 years with screen-detected, localized prostate cancer to radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy, or active surveillance and followed them up for 10 years. Approximately 77% of men had low-grade prostate cancer (Gleason score of 6) with a favorable prognosis. Thus, some men randomized to active surveillance had an intermediate-grade tumor (or other tumor characteristics) such that they may not have been considered a candidate for active surveillance in some settings. The trial did not find a significant improvement in all-cause or prostate cancer mortality in any of the treatment groups. The unexpectedly high survival rate across the trial groups (99%) made any potential differences harder to detect. Longer-term follow-up studies may provide important additional information. The trial reported a significant reduction in progression to metastatic cancer when comparing both radical prostatectomy (61% reduction [95% CI, 27%-79%]) and radiation therapy (52% reduction [95% CI, 13%-73%]) with active surveillance. In the active surveillance group, 6.0% of men developed metastatic cancer, compared with 2.7% and 2.3% in the radiation therapy and radical prostatectomy groups, respectively. During the 10-year follow-up period, 54.8% of men randomized to active surveillance crossed over to active treatment.<sup>15</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The other 2 randomized trials of radical prostatectomy took place prior to widespread PSA-based screening and thus recruited many men with tumors detected from clinical symptoms. Approximately 50% of men in the US-based Prostate Cancer Intervention vs Observation Trial (PIVOT) and almost 90% of men in the Scandinavian Prostate Cancer Group-4 (SPCG-4) trial had palpable tumors. The SPCG-4 trial compared radical prostatectomy with watchful waiting (a passive protocol dissimilar to active surveillance) and found a significant reduction over 13 years in all-cause and prostate cancer mortality.<sup>27</sup> The PIVOT trial did not find significant reductions overall in all-cause or prostate cancer mortality.<sup>28</sup> Recent results from extended follow-up of the PIVOT trial to a median of 12.7 years reported similar results; radical prostatectomy did not significantly reduce prostate cancer mortality (HR, 0.63 [95% CI, 0.39-1.02]) or all-cause mortality (HR, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.81-1.09]) compared with conservative management.<sup>29</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several cohort studies examining radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy found significant reductions in prostate cancer mortality when comparing active treatment with watchful waiting or other conservative approaches.<sup>3</sup> The cohort study results, however, should be interpreted with caution because of the potential for bias in treatment assignment. In these clinical settings, men who are healthier may have been more likely to receive active treatment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two studies reported on the difference in benefit by age. The PIVOT trial reported no significant differences by age (younger or older than 65 years) in the association between radical prostatectomy and all-cause mortality. In the SPCG-4 trial, the risk of all-cause mortality after radical prostatectomy vs watchful waiting was not significantly reduced among men 65 years and older (but was significantly reduced in men younger than 65 years).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment</h3>\r\n\r\n<h4>Potential Harms of Screening and Diagnosis</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to the ERSPC and PLCO trials, the USPSTF examined the results of a good-quality cohort study embedded within the ProtecT trial (Prostate Biopsy Effects [ProbE]), a fair-quality cohort study conducted in the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health system, as well as a report on complications of prostate biopsy from the ERSPC Rotterdam site to understand the potential harms of screening and diagnosis.<sup>3</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the large RCTs, one-fourth to one-third of men offered PSA-based screening had at least 1 positive screening test result. In the PLCO trial, 13% of men had undergone at least 1 biopsy. In the ERSPC trial, nearly 28 biopsies were performed for every 100 men randomized to screening.<sup>3</sup> In the ProbE trial, 7.3% of men reported moderate or greater pain, 5.5% reported moderate to severe fever, and 26.6% reported troublesome hematospermia within the 35 days after biopsy.<sup>28</sup> Complications from transrectal prostate biopsy resulted in 1.3% of men in the UK cohort, 1.6% of men in the VA cohort, and 0.5% of men in the Rotterdam cohort requiring hospitalization.<sup>30-32</sup> In these studies, two-thirds to three-fourths of biopsies demonstrated that the PSA screening test was a false positive.<sup>3</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overdiagnosis, the identification of asymptomatic cancer that would never cause symptoms or contribute to death, is one of the most important harms of PSA-based screening programs. Although there is no way to conclusively determine the overdiagnosis rate, the USPSTF used data from trials and reviewed decision analysis models to estimate the overdiagnosis rate. Trial data suggest that 21% of cases of screen-detected cancer in the PLCO trial and 50% in the ERSPC trial were overdiagnosed.<sup>3</sup> Using a different type of methodology (ie, not estimates based directly on single trials),<sup>3</sup> decision analysis models produced by the Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network estimated that between 1988 and 2000 in the United States, the overdiagnosis rate among cases of screen-detected prostate cancer was 22% to 42%.<sup>24</sup> Overdiagnosis increases with age; 1 study estimates that the overdiagnosis rate is more than 15-fold higher in men older than 85 years than in men aged 50 to 54 years.<sup>24</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Men older than 70 years in the ERSPC trial had a higher rate of false-positive results than younger men (younger than 55 years) (20.6% vs 3.5% in the first screening round, respectively). In the VA cohort study, fewer older men were sent for biopsy for a PSA level greater than 4.0 ng/mL (50.5% of men aged 65-69 years vs 25.4% of men aged 75-79 years). Data from the PLCO trial suggest that older men may be more likely than younger men to experience biopsy complications (28.2 vs 17.7 complications per 1000 biopsies, respectively; OR, 1.4 [95% CI, 0.9-2.4]; <em>P</em> = 0.06).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed studies evaluating psychological harms of screening and diagnosis. In 2 observational studies, men who had abnormal PSA screening results but benign biopsy results had significantly increased worry about prostate cancer at 6- to 8-week and at 1-year follow-up compared with men with normal PSA screening results.<sup>33</sup> After 1 year, one-third of men with a benign biopsy finding after an abnormal screening result thought about prostate cancer &ldquo;a lot&rdquo; or &ldquo;some,&rdquo; compared with 18% of men who had a normal PSA level (<em>P</em> = 0.005). In a prospective cohort study embedded in the UK ProtecT trial (n = 7344), there was no increase in anxiety or depression and similar scores on the Mental Health Component of the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey compared with baseline among men who had abnormal PSA screening results.<sup>34</sup> In a cross-sectional US study (n = 210), men with benign biopsy findings after abnormal PSA screening results did not have significantly greater anxiety than men who had normal results.<sup>35</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Potential Harms of Treatment</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Men who undergo active surveillance may undergo repeated biopsies and be exposed to potential repeated harms from biopsies (as discussed above). In addition, a significant proportion of men will go on to have active treatment with surgery or radiation therapy, with resultant harms (as discussed below).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF identified 3 good-quality and 1 fair-quality randomized trials and 7 large fair-quality observational studies that examined the potential harms of active treatment of prostate cancer.<sup>3</sup> A meta-analysis of the harms of radical prostatectomy concluded that 1 man will experience substantial urinary incontinence (requiring daily use of pads or worse) for every 7.9 men who undergo radical prostatectomy rather than conservative management (95% CI, 5.4-12.2), and 1 man will experience long-term erectile dysfunction for every 2.7 men who undergo radical prostatectomy rather than conservative management (95% CI, 2.2-3.6).<sup>3</sup> In addition, more than 20% of men in the PIVOT trial had a perioperative complication and 5.3% of men in a large US cohort study required reintervention for a surgical complication.<sup>3</sup> A meta-analysis of the harms of radiation therapy found that 1 man will experience long-term erectile dysfunction for every 7 men treated with radiation therapy rather than conservative management (95% CI, 5.1-10.7).<sup>3</sup> Although results are conflicting across cohort studies regarding the association of urinary incontinence and radiation therapy, rates of fecal incontinence and bowel urgency were as high as 31.8% after radiation therapy in 1 cohort study,<sup>36</sup> and these bowel complications were more common compared with conservative management in 2 trials and 3 cohort studies.<sup>3</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a median follow-up of 6 years in the ProtecT trial, there was no significant difference among men randomized to radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy, or active surveillance in reported anxiety, depression, health status, and cancer-related quality of life.<sup>36</sup> The older SPCG-4 trial had similar results after a median follow-up of 12 years when comparing men who received radical prostatectomy vs watchful waiting.<sup>37</sup> There was no evidence of an adverse effect of radical prostatectomy on generic quality-of-life measures compared with conservative management in cohort studies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In several studies, men older than 70 years had a significantly increased risk of medical complications and perioperative mortality after radical prostatectomy compared with younger men.<sup>3</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Conclusions from decision analysis models, which are consistent with the findings of randomized trials and cohort studies, suggest that more aggressive screening strategies, particularly those that use a lower PSA threshold for biopsy than generally used in the United States, provide the greatest potential reduction in death from prostate cancer. However, these strategies are also associated with more false positives, more biopsies, and higher rates of overdiagnosis.<sup>24</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Options for reducing the overdiagnosis rate include lowering the age at which to stop screening, extending the interval between screenings, and using higher PSA thresholds for biopsy. However, no strategy completely eliminates overdiagnosis. PSA-based screening for prostate cancer every 2 or 4 years instead of annually appears to provide a good trade-off between a reduction in overdiagnosis and a small reduction in mortality benefit.<sup>24</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Decision analysis models confirm the USPSTF&rsquo;s conclusion that the overall benefit of PSA-based screening for prostate cancer is sensitive to the values of individual men. The magnitude of net benefit of PSA-based screening depends on how each man weighs the potential benefits and harms of screening, diagnosis, and treatment. The value a man places on potential benefits and harms may also change over time. It may therefore be useful for clinicians to regularly revisit the decision to screen (or not screen) with their patients (<a href=\"#tab\">Table</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although active surveillance may reduce exposure to the potential harms of active treatment, it may not be viewed favorably by some men who value definitive action, are concerned about repeat biopsies, or want to avoid a potential increase in metastatic cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from April 11 to May 8, 2017. A number of comments suggested that because men are now living longer, they should be screened beyond 70 years of age. However, the USPSTF considered other evidence in addition to data on life expectancy when recommending against screening in men older than 70 years, including results from large screening trials that did not report a mortality benefit for men older than 70 years and evidence on the increased likelihood of harm from screening, diagnostic evaluation, treatment, overdiagnosis, and overtreatment. Several comments requested a recommendation for younger men and for baseline PSA-based screening in men 40 years and older or 50 years and older. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence that screening younger men or performing baseline PSA-based screening provides benefit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several comments asked for clarification about what new evidence led to the change from a D to a C grade. The new evidence included longer-term follow-up of the ERSPC trial and new data on reductions in risk of metastatic disease with screening. Although the added benefit reported from the additional follow-up to 13 years (from 10 years) in the ERSPC trial increased the number of lives saved from 1.07 to 1.28 (a small amount, according to some comments), these results gave the USPSTF more confidence that the benefit of screening could be greater over a 20- to 30-year period. Evidence newly considered since the draft recommendation statement was posted for comment includes the CAP trial, evidence on psychological harms, and longer-term follow-up of the PIVOT trial. This evidence led the USPSTF to continue to conclude that there is a small amount of benefit for some men. The USPSTF recognizes the importance of the potential harms of screening and treatment, including psychological harms and harms from active surveillance, and has added information about this evidence to the Rationale, Clinical Considerations, and Discussion sections. New evidence from the recently published CAP trial was added. Given the limitations of the CAP trial, including that it only examined 1-time PSA-based screening and the small difference between the percentage of men in the control and intervention groups (approximately 10%-15% vs 34%, respectively) who received PSA-based screening, the results of this trial did not change the USPSTF&rsquo;s overall assessment of the evidence and its recommendation.</p><h2>Table.

The USPSTF found adequate evidence that behavior-based weight loss maintenance interventions are associated with less weight gain after the cessation of interventions, compared with control groups. The magnitude of these benefits is moderate.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Harms of Behavioral Counseling Interventions</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence to bound the harms of intensive, multicomponent behavioral interventions (ie, behavior-based weight loss and weight loss maintenance interventions) in adults with obesity as small to none, based on the absence of reported harms in the evidence and the noninvasive nature of the interventions. When direct evidence is limited, absent, or restricted to select populations or clinical scenarios, the USPSTF may place conceptual upper or lower bounds on the magnitude of benefit or harms.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">USPSTF Assessment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that offering or referring adults with obesity to intensive, multicomponent behavioral interventions (ie, behavior-based weight loss and weight loss maintenance interventions) has a moderate net benefit.</p>","clinical":"<h2>Clinical Considerations</h2><h3 align=\"left\">Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This recommendation applies to adults 18 years or older. The USPSTF uses the following terms to define categories of increased BMI: &ldquo;overweight&rdquo; is a BMI of 25 to 29.9 and &ldquo;obesity&rdquo; is a BMI of 30 or higher. Obesity can be categorized as class 1 (BMI of 30.0 to 34.9), class 2 (BMI of 35.0 to 39.9), or class 3 (BMI of &ge;40) (see the <a href=\"#tab\">Table</a> for other USPSTF recommendations related to weight).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Behavioral Counseling Interventions</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Many of the effective intensive behavioral interventions considered by the USPSTF were designed to help participants achieve or maintain a 5% or greater weight loss through a combination of dietary changes and increased physical activity. The US Food and Drug Administration considers a weight loss of 5% as clinically important.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the intensive behavioral weight loss interventions considered by the USPSTF lasted for 1 to 2 years, and the majority had 12 or more sessions in the first year.<sup>1</sup> One-third of the interventions had a &ldquo;core&rdquo; phase (ranging from 3-12 months) followed by a &ldquo;support&rdquo; or &ldquo;maintenance&rdquo; phase (ranging from 9-12 months).<sup>1</sup> Most behavioral interventions encouraged self-monitoring of weight and provided tools to support weight loss or weight loss maintenance (eg, pedometers, food scales, or exercise videos).<sup>1</sup> Similar behavior change techniques and weight loss messages were used across the trials.<sup>1</sup> Some trials provided interventions modeled after the Diabetes Prevention Program lifestyle intervention for use in a primary care or community setting.<sup>1</sup> Study heterogeneity, trial quality, and differences in populations and settings made it difficult to identify the most effective intervention characteristics (eg, number of sessions, in-person vs remote sessions, or group- vs individual-based).<sup>1</sup> Benefits may depend on tailoring interventions to social, environmental, and individual factors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interventionists varied across the trials, and interventions included varied interactions with a primary care clinician. Primary care clinician involvement ranged from limited interactions with participants in interventions conducted by other practitioners or individuals (ie, group-based interventions conducted by lifestyle coaches or registered dietitians) to reinforcing intervention messages through brief counseling sessions.<sup>1</sup> Few interventions included a primary care clinician as the primary interventionist over 3 to 12 months of individual counseling. In the trials not involving a primary care clinician, the interventionists were highly diverse and included behavioral therapists, psychologists, registered dietitians, exercise physiologists, lifestyle coaches, and other staff. The majority of the trials focused on individual participants, but a few interventions invited family members to participate.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trials used various delivery methods (group, individual, mixed, and technology- or print-based). Group-based interventions ranged from 8 group sessions over 2.5 months to weekly group sessions over 1 year (median, 23 total sessions in the first year). These interventions consisted of classroom-style sessions lasting 1 to 2 hours.<sup>1</sup> Within the group-based interventions, some trials offered supplemental support with 1 brief individual counseling session, while other trials provided referral and free access to commercially available group-based weight loss programs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the individual-based interventions provided individual counseling sessions, with or without ongoing telephone support.<sup>1</sup> The remaining interventions were provided remotely through telephone counseling calls (average time, 15-30 minutes) and web-based self-monitoring and support. The median number of sessions in the first year for individual-based interventions was 12.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mixed interventions included comparatively equal numbers of group- and individual-based counseling sessions, with or without other forms of support (eg, telephone-, print-, or web-based). Most of these interventions took place for more than 1 year and involved more than 12 sessions (median, 23 total sessions in the first year).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among technology-based interventions, intervention components included computer- or web-based intervention modules,<sup>1</sup> web-based self-monitoring, mobile phone&ndash;based text messages, smartphone applications, social networking platforms, or DVD learning. Only 1 trial delivered its intervention through print-based tailored materials.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rates of participant adherence were generally high.<sup>1</sup> More than two-thirds of study participants completed interventions. In addition, all study participants completed more than two-thirds of the intervention. Participation rates did decline over time.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Behavior-based weight loss maintenance trials were designed to maintain weight loss by continuing dietary changes and physical activity.<sup>1</sup> Interventions included group interventions, technology-based individual counseling sessions, or a combination of individual and group counseling. Most weight loss maintenance interventions lasted for 12 to 18 months; the majority of interventions had more than 12 sessions in the first year.<sup>1</sup> Intervention components focused on nutrition, physical activity, self-monitoring, identifying barriers, problem solving, peer support, and relapse prevention.<sup>1</sup> Participants used tools such as food diaries and pedometers to help maintain weight loss.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interventions that combined pharmacotherapy with behavioral interventions reported greater weight loss and weight loss maintenance over 12 to 18 months compared with behavioral interventions alone.<sup>1</sup> However, the participants in the pharmacotherapy trials were required to meet highly selective inclusion criteria, including adherence to taking medications and meeting weight loss goals before enrollment. These trials also had high attrition.<sup>1</sup> Therefore, it is unclear how well patients tolerate these medications and whether the findings from these trials are applicable to the general US primary care population. In addition, data were lacking about the maintenance of improvement after discontinuation of pharmacotherapy.<sup>1</sup> As a result, the USPSTF encourages clinicians to promote behavioral interventions as the primary focus of effective interventions for weight loss in adults.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Additional Approaches to Prevention</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF has made recommendations on screening for abnormal blood glucose levels and type 2 diabetes,<sup>13</sup> screening for high blood pressure,<sup>14</sup> statin use in persons at risk for cardiovascular disease,<sup>15</sup> counseling for tobacco smoking cessation,<sup>16</sup> aspirin use in certain persons for prevention of cardiovascular disease,<sup>17</sup> and behavioral counseling interventions to promote a healthful diet and physical activity for cardiovascular disease prevention in adults with and without common risk factors<sup>18,19</sup> (<a href=\"#tab\">Table</a>). The USPSTF recommends that clinicians screen for obesity in children 6 years or older and offer or refer them to a comprehensive, intensive behavioral intervention (B recommendation).<sup>20</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Useful Resources</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Community Preventive Services Task Force recommends multicomponent interventions that use technology-supported coaching or counseling to help adults lose weight and maintain weight loss.<sup>21</sup></p><h2>Other Considerations</h2><h3 align=\"left\">Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Further research is needed to examine the effects of interventions for obesity on longer-term weight and health outcomes (eg, cardiovascular outcomes), including data on important subpopulations (eg, older adults, racial/ethnic groups, or persons who are overweight). Psychosocial, quality of life, and patient-centered outcomes should continue to be evaluated in future studies. Well-designed pragmatic trials and improved reporting of intervention characteristics to enable evaluation and dissemination of interventions in primary care settings are needed. Future research is needed on factors (eg, genetics or untreated medical or psychological conditions) that may be barriers to weight loss during behavioral interventions. Trials are needed that examine whether interventions that focus on both weight loss and support of persons living with obesity improve patient-centered outcomes. Comparative effectiveness trials would provide more evidence about the components of effective interventions.</p><h2>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h2><p>This recommendation updates the 2012 USPSTF recommendation statement on screening for obesity in adults (B recommendation).<sup>33</sup></p>","other":"<h2>Recommendations of Others</h2><p>The Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care recommends screening for obesity in adults with BMI at primary care visits.<sup>34</sup> The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association, and the Obesity Society recommend screening for obesity in adults with BMI and waist circumference.<sup>35,36</sup> The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, American College of Endocrinology, and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommend screening for obesity with BMI and using waist circumference as a supplement in adults with a BMI higher than 35.<sup>37,38</sup> The American Academy of Family Physicians recommends screening for obesity in all adults and offering or referring patients with a BMI of 30 or higher to intensive, multicomponent behavioral interventions.<sup>39</sup></p>","discussion":"<h2>Discussion</h2><h3 align=\"left\">Burden of Disease</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>From 2013 to 2014, the prevalence of obesity in the United States was greater than 35% among men and 40% among women.<sup>2</sup> One in 13 Americans has a BMI higher than 40 (class 3 obesity).<sup>22</sup> According to 2011-2014 data, the age-adjusted prevalence of persons who are overweight or obese is 72.8% among men and 66.2% among women.<sup>23</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The prevalence of overweight and obesity varies across race/ethnicity. The age-adjusted prevalence of obesity is higher among non-Hispanic black (57.2%) and Hispanic (46.9%) women than among non-Hispanic white (38.2%) women. Among men, obesity prevalence is 38.0% in non-Hispanic black, 37.9% in Hispanic, and 34.7% in non-Hispanic white men.<sup>24</sup> Obesity rates among Asian Americans are lower than among other racial/ethnic groups (12.6% and 12.4% in men and women, respectively). However, Asian Americans have higher body fat at a given BMI than other racial/ethnic groups. When using an adjusted cut point of greater than 25, obesity prevalence is higher among US-born Asian Americans (43%) than among non-Hispanic whites (36%).<sup>25</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Scope of Review</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF commissioned a systematic evidence review to update its 2012 recommendation on screening for obesity in adults.<sup>1,26</sup> Because screening for obesity is now part of routine clinical practice, it was not a focus of this review. The USPSTF reviewed evidence on interventions (behavioral counseling and pharmacotherapy) for weight loss or weight loss maintenance that can be provided in or referred from a primary care setting. Waist circumference may be an acceptable alternative to BMI measurement in some patient subpopulations. Surgical weight loss interventions and nonsurgical weight loss devices (eg, gastric balloons) are considered to be outside the scope of the primary care setting.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Effectiveness of Behavioral Counseling and Pharmacotherapy Interventions</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on 4 types of interventions: behavior-based weight loss (80 trials), behavior-based weight loss maintenance (9 trials), pharmacotherapy-based weight loss (32 trials), and pharmacotherapy-based weight loss maintenance (3 trials). In the weight loss maintenance trials, patient randomization occurred after prior weight loss.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h4 align=\"left\">Behavioral Counseling Interventions</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF identified 89 behavior-based weight loss and weight loss maintenance trials, 26 of which were good quality and 63 of which were fair quality. Eighty trials focused on behavior-based weight loss interventions.<sup>1</sup> The majority of behavior-based weight loss intervention trials (47 trials) were conducted in the United States; other study sites included Europe (15 trials), the United Kingdom (11 trials), Japan (3 trials), Australia (2 trials), and Canada (2 trials). In more than half of the trials (40 trials), participants came from an unselected population of adults who were overweight or had obesity. In the remaining trials, enrolled participants had elevated clinical or subclinical risk of cardiovascular disease or cancer.<sup>1</sup> Trial sample sizes ranged from 30 to 2161. The mean baseline BMI ranged from 25 to 39.2 (median, 33.4), and the mean age ranged from 22 to 66 years (median, 50.3 years). Fourteen trials were limited to women, and 4 trials were restricted to men.<sup>1</sup> Eleven trials focused on specific racial/ethnic groups (eg, African American, Asian and South Asian, American Indian, or Hispanic). Socioeconomic status was not well reported in trials; however, when described, most participants were of medium to high socioeconomic status. Most trials did not stratify results by BMI or BMI category, age, race/ethnicity, or health status.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although some trials included participants who were overweight, the average BMI in the majority of trials was in the obese range (median BMI, &gt;33).<sup>1</sup> Therefore, the USPSTF was unable to examine the differential effects of interventions among participants who were overweight or had obesity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nine trials focused on behavior-based weight loss maintenance.<sup>1</sup> Study sites were in the United States, the United Kingdom, Finland, and Australia. In most trials (8 trials), participants came from an unselected population of adults who were overweight or had obesity. One trial enrolled participants with cardiovascular risk factors.<sup>1</sup> Trial sample sizes ranged from 92 to 1032. Participants were required to meet weight loss goals before enrollment. The mean BMI at enrollment ranged from 28.4 to 41.7 and the mean age ranged from 46.4 to 61.8 years (median, 49.2 years).<sup>1</sup> One trial was limited to women, and 1 trial was limited to men. The majority of trials did not report information regarding race/ethnicity or socioeconomic status. When this information was reported, participants were mostly white and of medium to high socioeconomic status.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h4 align=\"left\">Behavior-Based Weight Loss and Weight Loss Maintenance Interventions</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Few health outcomes were identified in the behavior-based weight loss and weight loss maintenance trials (20 trials [n = 9910]). There were no significant differences in mortality between intervention and control groups (4 trials [n = 4442]). There were also no significant differences in cardiovascular events between intervention and control groups (2 trials [n = 2666]).<sup>1</sup> Trials that examined health-related quality of life (17 trials [n = 7120]) mostly demonstrated a lack of statistically significant differences between intervention and control groups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Intermediate outcomes (eg, prevalence of high blood pressure or the metabolic syndrome, use of cardiovascular disease medications, or estimated 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease) were seldom reported. Effects of interventions on cardiovascular disease risk, the metabolic syndrome, hypertension or hyperlipidemia diagnoses, and medication use were mixed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thirteen behavior-based weight loss trials (n = 4095) evaluated incident type 2 diabetes in intervention vs control groups. Twelve of the 13 trials enrolled participants with impaired fasting glucose or increased risk for type 2 diabetes (ie, persons with a family history of diabetes or personal history of gestational diabetes or the metabolic syndrome). In the good-quality Diabetes Prevention Program trial (n = 1295), the estimated cumulative incidence of type 2 diabetes at 3 years was 14.4% vs 28.9% in the intervention vs placebo groups, respectively, and the number needed to treat to prevent 1 case of diabetes was 6.8. The good-quality Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study (n = 523) demonstrated that participants in the intervention group were significantly less likely to develop type 2 diabetes than those in the control group after 9 years (40.0% vs 54.5%, respectively; hazard ratio, 0.4 [95% CI, 0.3 to 0.7]). In the remaining trials, the differences between the intervention and control groups were not statistically significant. However, these trials were smaller and shorter than the larger trials. Pooling the trials (9 studies; n = 3140) showed a significant reduction in the risk of developing type 2 diabetes over 1 to 9 years (pooled risk ratio, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.51 to 0.89]; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 49.2%).<sup>1,27-29</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Participants in behavior-based weight loss intervention groups demonstrated greater weight loss and decreased waist circumference compared with those in control groups at 24 months of follow-up. At 12 to 18 months, pooled results showed greater weight loss among intervention participants (&minus;2.39 kg [&minus;5.3 lb] [95% CI, &minus;2.86 to &minus;1.93]; 67 trials [n = 22,065]; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 90.0%).<sup>1</sup> The mean absolute change in weight ranged from &minus;0.5 kg (&minus;1.1 lb) to &minus;9.3 kg (&minus;20.5 lb) among intervention groups and from 1.4 kg (3.1 lb) to &minus;5.6 (&minus;12.3 lb) among control groups. At 12 to 18 months, intervention participants were more likely to lose 5% of their initial weight compared with control participants (risk ratio, 1.94 [95% CI, 1.70 to 2.22]; 38 trials [n = 12,231]; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 67.2%; number needed to treat = 8).<sup>1</sup> Participants in weight loss maintenance interventions had less weight gain compared with participants in control groups (pooled mean difference in weight change, &minus;1.59 kg [&minus;3.5 lb] [95% CI, &minus;2.38 to &minus;0.79]; 8 studies [n = 1408]; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 26.8%).<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h4 align=\"left\">Pharmacotherapy-Based Weight Loss and Weight Loss Maintenance Interventions</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Pharmacotherapy trials evaluated liraglutide (4 trials), lorcaserin (4 trials), naltrexone and bupropion (3 trials), orlistat (21 trials), and phentermine-topiramate (3 trials) in combination with behavioral counseling.<sup>1</sup> The review of pharmacotherapy-based trials focused on trials that used dosages approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. All trials were fair quality. Across all trials, both study groups (ie, placebo and pharmacotherapy groups) received the same behavioral interventions. The trials were conducted in the United States, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and other regions. Participant characteristics were similar to those in the behavioral intervention trials. Many trials required participants to demonstrate medication adherence, meet weight loss goals before enrollment, or both. The more narrowly defined inclusion criteria of these trials resulted in more selective populations enrolled as study participants.<sup>1</sup> Meta-analyses could not be conducted because of the few number of trials for each drug or variability in outcome reporting.<sup>1</sup> The rate of trial completion in the medication and placebo groups ranged from 10% to 93% (most ranged from 50% to 70%).<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ten trials of pharmacotherapy-based interventions (n = 13,145) examined quality of life outcomes.<sup>1</sup> Many trials showed improvement in obesity-specific quality of life measures among participants receiving pharmacotherapy compared with placebo. However, these outcomes are difficult to interpret because of high dropout rates (&ge;35% in half of the included trials), the small differences between study groups, and the unclear clinical significance of improved quality of life scores.<sup>1</sup> Trials that reported cardiovascular events found few events in any group (2 trials [n = 6210]). Pharmacotherapy-based weight loss maintenance trials did not report any health outcomes.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Limited data from 4 trials examined weight loss medication and incident diabetes (n = 9763) and found a reduced risk of diabetes. However, these trials were limited by high dropout rates.<sup>1,26</sup> Other intermediate outcomes (use of lipid-lowering and antihypertensive medications, prevalence of the metabolic syndrome, and 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease) were sparsely reported and had mixed findings.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>At 12 to 18 months, participants in pharmacotherapy-based weight loss trials (32 trials) had more weight loss compared with placebo groups (mean or least squares mean difference in weight change, &minus;1.0 kg [&minus;2.2 lb] to &minus;5.8 kg [&minus;12.8 lb]).<sup>1,26</sup> Participants also experienced a greater decrease in waist circumference and a greater likelihood of losing 5% of their initial weight compared with placebo groups. Three pharmacotherapy-based weight loss maintenance trials showed that participants receiving the intervention had better weight loss maintenance compared with placebo groups over 12 to 36 months (mean difference, &minus;0.6 to &minus;3.5 kg).<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Potential Harms of Behavioral Counseling Interventions</h3>\r\n\r\n<h4 align=\"left\">Behavior-Based Weight Loss and Weight Loss Maintenance Interventions</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF looked for evidence on potential harms of behavioral weight-loss interventions, including increased risk for fractures, serious injuries resulting from increased physical activity, and an increased risk for eating disorders, weight stigma, and weight fluctuation. Thirty trials (n = 12,824) examined the harms of behavior-based weight loss and weight loss maintenance interventions. Fifteen trials were good quality and 15 trials were fair quality. Intervention harms were sparsely reported. Overall, the trials showed no serious harms, and most trials observed no difference in the rate of adverse events between intervention and control groups. Three trials demonstrated mixed results for musculoskeletal problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4 align=\"left\">Pharmacotherapy-Based Weight Loss and Weight Loss Maintenance Interventions</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Pharmacological agents for weight loss have multiple potential harms, including anxiety, pancreatitis, and gastrointestinal symptoms with liraglutide; dizziness and cognitive impairment with lorcaserin; nausea, constipation, headache, and dry mouth with naltrexone and bupropion; cramps, flatus, fecal incontinence, and oily spotting with orlistat; and mood disorders, elevated heart rate, and metabolic acidosis with phentermine-topiramate. These harms have not been well studied. Thirty-three trials and 2 observational studies (n = 239,428), all fair quality, assessed the harms of pharmacotherapy-based weight loss and weight loss maintenance interventions. Serious adverse events were uncommon and similar between groups.<sup>1</sup> Adverse event rates were high in both intervention and placebo groups by 12 months, with 80% to 96% of participants experiencing an adverse event in the medication group compared with 63% to 94% in the placebo group. The higher rate of adverse events in the medication groups resulted in higher dropout rates than in the placebo groups.<sup>1</sup> Other limitations of the pharmacotherapy studies include a small number of trials for each medication, methodological variability, missing data, poor follow-up, and limited applicability (participants met narrowly defined inclusion criteria).<sup>26</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that intensive, multicomponent behavioral interventions in adults with obesity can lead to clinically significant improvements in weight status and reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes among adults with obesity and elevated plasma glucose levels; these interventions are of moderate benefit. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that behavior-based weight loss maintenance interventions are of moderate benefit. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the harms of intensive, multicomponent behavioral interventions (including weight loss maintenance interventions) in adults with obesity are small to none.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Therefore, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that offering or referring adults with obesity to intensive behavioral interventions or behavior-based weight loss maintenance interventions has a moderate net benefit.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Various environmental and genetic factors play an important role in the development of obesity. After obesity has developed, an individual&rsquo;s biological mechanisms work to sustain the body&rsquo;s weight gain.<sup>30</sup> Changes in neuronal signaling decrease satiety and perceptions of the amount of food eaten. As a result, weight loss can be challenging.<sup>31</sup> Weight gain can progressively increase over the life span of an adult until later in life. Weight declines after the sixth decade of life.<sup>32</sup> An increasing BMI may lead to increased long-term health risks. Losing weight may reduce the risk for illness and mortality and improve overall health.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from February 20 to March 19, 2018. In response to comments, the USPSTF expanded the description of behavioral counseling interventions in the Clinical Considerations section. In the Discussion section, the USPSTF clarified why persons who are overweight were not included in the recommendation statement, expanded the description on harms of behavioral counseling interventions and pharmacotherapy, and added the limitations of pharmacotherapy trials.</p><h2>Table.

Melanoma is the fifth-leading type of incident cancer, and 2.2% of adults will be diagnosed with it in their lifetime.<sup>1</sup> Although invasive melanoma accounts for 2% of all skin cancer cases, it is responsible for 80% of skin cancer deaths.<sup>1</sup> Basal and squamous cell carcinoma, the 2 predominant types of nonmelanoma skin cancer, represent the vast majority of skin cancer cases. There were an estimated 3.3 million new cases of nonmelanoma skin cancer in 2012 and an estimated 91,270 new cases of melanoma skin cancer in 2018.<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Recognition of Risk Status</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Exposure to UV radiation during childhood and adolescence increases the risk of skin cancer later in life, especially when more severe damage occurs, such as with severe sunburns. Persons with fair skin types (ivory or pale skin, light hair and eye color, freckles, or those who sunburn easily) are at increased risk of skin cancer. Persons who use tanning beds and those with a history of sunburns or previous skin cancer are also at substantially increased risk of skin cancer. Other factors that further increase risk include an increased number of nevi (moles) and atypical nevi, family history of skin cancer, HIV infection, and history of receiving an organ transplant. Most studies of interventions to increase sun protection behaviors have been limited to persons with fair skin types.<sup>2-4</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Benefits of Behavioral Counseling Interventions</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Behavioral counseling interventions target sun protection behaviors to reduce UV radiation exposure. UV radiation is a known carcinogen<sup>5</sup> that damages DNA and causes most skin cancer cases.<sup>6</sup> A substantial body of observational evidence demonstrates that the strongest connection between UV radiation exposure and skin cancer results from exposure in childhood and adolescence. Sun protection behaviors include the use of broad-spectrum sunscreen with a sun-protection factor of 15 or greater; wearing hats, sunglasses, or sun-protective clothing; avoiding sun exposure; seeking shade during midday hours (10 am to 4 pm); and avoiding indoor tanning bed use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that behavioral counseling interventions available in or referable from a primary care setting result in a moderate increase in the use of sun protection behaviors for persons aged 6 months to 24 years with fair skin types.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that behavioral counseling interventions available in or referable from a primary care setting result in a small increase in the use of sun protection behaviors for persons older than 24 years with fair skin types.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found insufficient evidence regarding the benefits of counseling adults about skin self-examination to prevent skin cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Harms of Behavioral Counseling Interventions</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the harms related to behavioral counseling interventions and sun protection behaviors in young persons or adults are small. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence regarding the harms of counseling adults about skin self-examination.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that behavioral counseling interventions have a moderate net benefit for young adults, adolescents, and children aged 6 months to 24 years with fair skin types.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that behavioral counseling interventions have a small benefit in adults older than 24 years with fair skin types.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of counseling adults about skin self-examination.</p>","clinical":"<h2>Clinical Considerations</h2><h3><strong><a id=\"clinical\" name=\"clinical\"></a></strong>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This recommendation applies to asymptomatic persons without a history of skin cancer. Because most trials of skin cancer counseling predominantly include persons with fair skin types, the USPSTF limited its recommendation to this population.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Persons with fair skin types (ivory or pale skin, light eye color, red or blond hair, freckles, those who sunburn easily) are at increased risk of skin cancer and should be counseled. Other factors that further increase risk include a history of sunburns, previous use of indoor tanning beds, and a family or personal history of skin cancer. Persons with an increased number of nevi and atypical nevi are at increased risk of melanoma. Persons with a compromised immune system (eg, persons living with HIV, persons who have received an organ transplant) are at increased risk of skin cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Behavioral Counseling Interventions</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>All studies conducted in children and adolescents focused on sun protection behaviors; most were directed at parents, and some provided child-specific materials or messages. Half of the interventions included face-to-face counseling, and all included print materials. Three studies provided the intervention in conjunction with well-child visits. The majority of studies conducted in young adults and adults focused on improving sun protection behaviors, and 2 studies used &ldquo;appearance-focused&rdquo; messages. The mode of delivery varied and included mail-based, face-to-face or telephone counseling, and technology-based (text messages, online programs and modules, personal UV facial photographs) interventions.<sup>2</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>\r\n\r\n<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Counseling adults about performing skin self-examination appears to result in an increase of such examinations. The potential benefit of behavioral counseling about skin self-examination is uncertain because of the lack of evidence on the link between behavior change and skin cancer or other health outcomes. In addition, there is no evidence about the incremental benefit that might occur with skin self-examination above the benefit from counseling for skin protective behaviors and from current levels of skin examinations being performed by clinicians.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Potential Harms</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Skin self-examination is performed by the patient and is noninvasive. Psychosocial harms, such as anxiety or cancer worry, are possible. If skin self-examination leads to biopsy, procedural harms such as pain, bleeding, scarring, or infection could occur.<sup>7</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Current Practice</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The frequency of behavioral counseling for skin self-examination in the asymptomatic population is not well known.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Additional Approaches to Prevention</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Community Preventive Services Task Force recommends child care center&ndash;based, primary and middle school&ndash;based, and multicomponent community-wide interventions for the prevention of skin cancer.<sup>8</sup> These interventions combine school- and community-based communications and policy to increase preventive behaviors (eg, covering up, using shade, or avoiding the sun during peak UV hours) among certain populations in specific settings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) provides information to help guide patients and clinicians regarding sun protection and the use and effectiveness of broad-spectrum sunscreen.<sup>9</sup> The FDA has determined that broad-spectrum sunscreens with a sun-protection factor of 15 or greater, reapplied at least every 2 hours, protect against both UVA and UVB radiation and reduce the risk of skin cancer and early skin aging. The FDA also provides consumer education materials on the dangers of indoor tanning.<sup>10</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Environmental Protection Agency provides a variety of educational tools regarding sun safety, including state-specific information, and interactive widgets and smartphone applications that forecast UV exposure by zip code or city. It also provides sun safety fact sheets and handouts, including age-appropriate materials.<sup>11</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Useful Resources</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF has issued a recommendation on screening for skin cancer in adults.<sup>12</sup></p><h2>Other Considerations</h2><h3>Implementation</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Interventions included tailored mailings, print materials, and in-person counseling by health professionals. Interventions for children were directed mostly toward parents; some materials were child-specific. Counseling interventions for children, their parents, or both provided messages focused on increasing sun protection behaviors (eg, using sunscreen, avoiding midday sun, wearing sun-protective clothing). Some print-based interventions included materials tailored to the child&rsquo;s risk level, barriers to change, self-efficacy, or other factors. Health professionals providing in-person counseling included primary care clinicians and health educators.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One trial of an intervention involving children 3 years and younger used clinician counseling and print materials for parents promoting child sun protection with sun protection aids (sunscreen samples and hat).<sup>13</sup> Several trials in children aged 3 to 10 years used standard or tailored mailings over 1 to 36 months.<sup>14-17</sup> One study also included a DVD in addition to a standard mailing promoting sun protection. One trial used a 1-day, in-person parent education session with a children&#39;s video, print materials, and sun protection aids (shirt, hat, and sunscreen). For the single study in adolescents, clinicians directly counseled participants, with 4 follow-up telephone counseling sessions by a health educator over 18 months; mailed materials and sunscreen samples were also used.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 16 trials among adults, interventions included a variety of messages and components, conducted in a range of settings.<sup>2, 4</sup> Technology-based interventions included an interactive web program and tailored text messages on sun protection, as well as appearance-focused print materials. The web program study reported reduced sunburns after the intervention, which provided information on topics such as indoor tanning, UV radiation exposure and health, skin cancer, sunscreen, and skin examination. Each module took about 10 minutes to complete and included a goal-setting section. Other interventions that increased sun protection behaviors in adults included mailed print materials containing personalized risk feedback and recommendations, self-monitoring aids for UV exposure, and skin cancer prevention and detection information; individualized computer reports; and an interactive educational computer program on skin cancer prevention that provided individual feedback on personal risk of skin cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A better understanding of the effectiveness of counseling on the use of sun protection behaviors in adults 25 years and older is needed to address the key evidence gap on counseling for this age group. Research that evaluates the association between UV exposure during adulthood and skin cancer risk would also be valuable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, studies regarding the effectiveness of counseling persons without a fair skin type are lacking. Ideally, research studies would provide measurements of sun exposure, sunburn, precursor skin lesions, and cancer among large trial populations, with an emphasis on behaviors and health outcomes among persons who receive an intervention focused on sun protection behaviors. Such studies would also assess whether these behaviors continue after trial completion. These cohorts should include populations with diverse skin colors and should include adolescents, young adults, and preschool-aged children and their parents. These studies may be used to further develop technologies and vehicles for administering relevant interventions for behavior change in the primary care setting, especially among nonwhite persons, young adults, and persons who practice indoor or outdoor tanning. Further evidence is needed to assess the balance of benefits and harms of counseling adults about skin self-examination to prevent skin cancer and premature death.</p><h2>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h2><p>This recommendation replaces the 2012 USPSTF recommendation on counseling about skin cancer prevention<sup>19</sup> and the skin self-examination portion of the 2009 USPSTF recommendation on screening for skin cancer.<sup>20</sup> In this updated recommendation, the USPSTF expanded the age range for behavioral counseling interventions to include persons aged 6 months to 24 years with fair skin types (the previous recommendation applied to persons aged 10 to 24 years, based on the evidence available at that time). Recent studies in children younger than 10 years resulted in the USPSTF extending the lower end of the age range to 6 months, the minimum age recommended for sunscreen use. Based on additional evidence since the prior recommendation, the USPSTF now also recommends that clinicians consider selectively offering counseling to adults older than 24 years with fair skin types. As in 2012, the evidence on persons without a fair skin type remains insufficient for this population to be included in the recommendation statement. The evidence continues to be insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of counseling adults about skin self-examination to prevent skin cancer, as it was in 2009.</p>","other":"<h2>Recommendations of Others</h2><p>The US Surgeon General,<sup>40</sup> American Cancer Society,<sup>41</sup> American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,<sup>42</sup> American Academy of Pediatrics,<sup>43</sup> Royal Australian College of General Practitioners,<sup>44</sup> and the World Health Organization&rsquo;s International Agency for Research on Cancer<sup>45</sup> endorse the involvement of clinicians in counseling patients about skin cancer prevention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Community Preventive Services Task Force recommends education and policy approaches to encourage sun protection behaviors in child care centers, schools, recreational sites, and occupational settings.

Melanoma is less common than basal or squamous cell carcinoma but has a much higher death rate. In 2018, an estimated 91,270 new cases of melanoma are expected, representing 5.2% of all new cancer cases.<sup>1</sup> An estimated 9730 persons will die of the disease, representing 1.6% of all cancer deaths.<sup>18</sup> Although age-adjusted incidence rates have increased from 1989 to 2014 (from 13.7 to 25.2 cases per 100,000 persons), the death rate has remained fairly stable over the same period (from 2.7 to 2.6 deaths per 100,000 persons).<sup>18</sup> Adults older than 50 years; men; and persons with fair skin types are at increased risk. Melanoma is most frequently diagnosed among adults aged 65 to 74 years; death rates are highest among the middle-aged and elderly. Melanoma is 5 times more common among Hispanic adults and 25 times more common among white than African American adults.<sup>18</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nonmelanoma skin cancer, of which most cases are basal and squamous cell skin cancer, is associated with a substantial burden to the patient but rarely results in death. Basal cell skin cancer constitutes about 80% of nonmelanoma skin cancer cases, and squamous cell skin cancer constitutes about 20%.<sup>6</sup> In general, nonmelanoma skin cancer accounts for a small percentage of all cancer deaths, mostly in older adults or persons with a compromised immune system. An estimated 2000 persons die from nonmelanoma skin cancer each year.<sup>6</sup> The true prevalence of nonmelanoma skin cancer is difficult to estimate because it is not a required cancer for registry entry; an estimated 5.4 million cases were diagnosed in 3.3 million persons in 2012.<sup>6</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF commissioned a systematic evidence review to update its 2012 recommendation on behavioral counseling for the primary prevention of skin cancer<sup>19</sup> and its 2009 recommendation on screening for skin cancer with skin self-examination.<sup>20</sup> The review<sup>2, 4</sup> focused on direct evidence that counseling patients about sun protection reduces intermediate outcomes (eg, sunburn or precursor skin lesions) or skin cancer. The review also sought evidence on the link between counseling and behavior change, the link between behavior change and skin cancer incidence, and the harms of counseling or changes in sun protection behavior. In addition, the review examined evidence regarding counseling patients to perform skin self-examination and skin cancer outcomes and the harms of skin self-examination.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Behavioral Counseling Interventions to Change Behavior</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Many counseling interventions were found to be moderately effective in modifying sun protection behaviors among children, adolescents, and young adults but less effective in adults. Both traditional cancer prevention and appearance-focused messages (ie, stressing the aging effects of UV radiation on the skin) increased sun protection behaviors compared with control groups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of the 6 trials that evaluated the effect of interventions on sun protection behaviors among children and adolescents, 5 reported a statistically significant improvement in parent-reported composite scores of child sun protection behaviors compared with control groups.<sup>13, 15, 17, 21, 22</sup> Four of the 6 trials specifically targeted children aged 3 to 10 years, 1 trial focused on children from birth to 3 years, and 1 trial focused on adolescents aged 11 to 15 years. Among the 4 trials in children aged 3 to 10 years, 3 showed statistically significant differences in changes in sun protection behavior and sunscreen use at 3 months to 3 years of follow-up.<sup>14-16</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A cluster randomized clinical trial<sup>13</sup> that provided counseling to parents of newborns in a series of 4 well-child visits showed statistically significant improvement in composite sun protection scores in the intervention group. However, most individual measures were not statistically significant, and it was difficult to determine the clinical relevance of the small improvements. An in-person counseling intervention targeting adolescents and involving clinicians and health educators showed that sun protection scores were higher in the intervention group than in the control group at 2 years of follow-up.<sup>21</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adequate evidence of the effectiveness of counseling interventions was found in 2 of the 3 fair-quality trials conducted among young adults. In a web-based study of 18- to 25-year olds, participants viewed an interactive 12-module web program featuring 10-minute topics such as indoor tanning, UV exposure and health, skin cancer, and skin examination.<sup>22</sup> At 3 months of follow-up, there was a significant improvement in past-month UV exposure and sun protection behaviors, sunscreen use, outdoor tanning, and skin self-examination. Another study (a randomized clinical trial) used a video intervention, with or without UV facial photography; the intervention showed no effect on composite sun protection scores.<sup>23</sup> In the third young adult study, women who used indoor tanning were given a 24-page booklet that detailed the effects of UV radiation and indoor tanning and appearance-enhancing alternatives to indoor tanning. At 6 months of follow-up, there was a significantly smaller increase in indoor tanning sessions in the past 3 months in the intervention group than in the control group.<sup>24</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Evidence of the effectiveness of counseling interventions in adults older than 24 years is mixed. Six of 12 trials that addressed sun protection behavior composite scores in adults found an increase in such behaviors compared with control groups.<sup>2, 4</sup> Three of these interventions promoted sun protection with tailored mailings, 2 used interactive online programs, and 1 used tailored text messages. Four of 7 trials assessing sunscreen use found an increase in this outcome. Of 3 trials of self-reported indoor tanning behavior, only 1 trial using an appearance-focused intervention among young female adults noted a significant improvement compared with the control group.<sup>24</sup> Effective interventions were more often of longer duration or had more frequent contacts with participants during the study period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trials of counseling interventions that focused on counseling patients to perform skin self-examination as a means of reducing skin cancer risk were inconclusive. A trial with more than 1300 participants showed that those who received a skin self-examination counseling intervention did not have significant differences in the incidence of skin cancer cases or atypical nevi compared with those in the control group at 12 months of follow-up.<sup>25</sup> Several studies showed that skin self-examination interventions increase the likelihood of participants reporting that they perform skin self-examination.<sup>2, 4</sup> Additional studies are needed to determine the direct effect of skin self-examination on skin cancer risk.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Link Between Behavior Change and Cancer Risk</h3>\r\n\r\n<h4>Sun Exposure</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Total and recreational sun exposure during childhood is associated with increased melanoma risk. Studies that measured long-term or total sun exposure showed mixed association between increased sun exposure and skin cancer risk. Several fair- to good-quality studies demonstrated a link between adult recreational exposure to UV radiation and increased melanoma risk.<sup>3</sup> One large population-based study showed increased risk of both melanoma incidence and melanoma death with higher quartiles of UV exposure.<sup>26</sup> Two recent meta-analyses and 2 cohort studies also showed an increased risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer in persons with increased exposure to ambient UV radiation.<sup>2</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Indoor Tanning</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Indoor tanning is associated with increased melanoma risk, and younger age at first indoor tanning exposure increases this risk.<sup>27</sup> A meta-analysis provided evidence of a dose-response relationship between melanoma risk and indoor tanning in women younger than 50 years.<sup>28</sup> Four studies found that increasing indoor tanning frequency was associated with increased melanoma risk. Two systematic reviews, 1 cohort study, and 1 case-control study found evidence that having ever used indoor tanning was associated with increased risk of squamous cell and basal cell carcinoma compared with never having used indoor tanning.<sup>29-32</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Sunscreen Use</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Two studies in adults provided new evidence of a protective effect of sunscreen use. One study, which was considered by the USPSTF for its previous recommendation statement, analyzed long-term follow-up data from a randomized clinical trial. In this study, intervention group participants applied sunscreen daily, while control group participants continued their usual behavior. At 4.5 years, the intervention group had a decreased risk of squamous cell carcinoma.<sup>33</sup> Ten years after conclusion of the trial, the intervention group had half as many incident melanomas as the control group. Overall, melanoma risk was reduced in the intervention group compared with the control group and was most pronounced for invasive melanoma compared with in situ melanoma.<sup>34</sup> A large US case-control study also demonstrated a lower likelihood of melanoma in persons routinely using sunscreen compared with those who do not.<sup>29</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Skin Self-Examination and Health Outcomes</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Evidence on the effectiveness of skin self-examination in reducing death or illness is lacking. One 20-year follow-up study showed no association between skin self-examination and skin cancer death.<sup>35</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Potential Harms of Behavioral Counseling Interventions</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Potential harms of interventions promoting sun protection behaviors include skin reactions to sunscreen lotion, vitamin D deficiency, reduced physical activity due to avoiding the outdoors, and a paradoxical increase in sun exposure from a false reassurance of protection from sunscreen use. Sunscreen use can be associated with numerous transient skin reactions, including allergic, irritant, and photoallergic contact dermatitis. Although vitamin D deficiency is a hypothetical harm of sun avoidance, recent studies have not shown an association between sunscreen use and decreased vitamin D levels. Among the sparse evidence available, 1 study suggested that sun protection behaviors do not lead to decreased physical activity or increased body mass index.<sup>36</sup> Older studies reported that sunscreen use did not result in an intentional increase in sun exposure, but 2 recent studies showed that sunscreen use was associated with higher likelihood of multiple sunburns.<sup>37, 38</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Persons who performed skin self-examination were more likely to subsequently undergo a skin procedure compared with those who did not, as evidenced by 1 trial, indicating a potential harm of skin self-examination. Although melanoma death rates have remained stable, the increasing number of skin biopsies and rising melanoma incidence over recent decades provide evidence for overdiagnosis.<sup>39</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF determined that behavioral counseling interventions are of moderate benefit in increasing sun protection behaviors in children, adolescents, and young adults with fair skin types. The link of behavior change to outcomes is supported by several trials and a substantial body of observational evidence showing that the strongest connection between UV radiation exposure and skin cancer stems from exposure in childhood and adolescence. Evidence of a connection between sun exposure in adulthood and melanoma is less robust than in childhood. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the harms related to counseling or sun protection behaviors are small. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the net benefit of counseling to decrease UV exposure and reduce skin cancer risk is moderate in children, adolescents, and young adults aged 6 months to 24 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that behavioral counseling interventions result in a small increase in sun protection behaviors in adults older than 24 years. The harms of counseling are small. The USPSTF determined that the evidence supporting a link between decreased UV exposure in adulthood and skin cancer risk is adequate. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the net benefit of counseling to decrease UV exposure and reduce skin cancer risk is small in adults older than 24 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the benefits and harms of counseling adults about skin self-examination to prevent skin cancer. Therefore, the USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of counseling adults about skin self-examination to prevent skin cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>UV radiation from both solar and artificial sources has been classified as a human carcinogen by national and international organizations. Epidemiologic evidence suggests that the effect of UV radiation exposure from typical doses of sunlight varies over the life span, with some evidence of a window of biological vulnerability in childhood and adolescence that translates into increased skin cancer risk later in life. Much of the available evidence concerns the most common skin lesions, nonmalignant neoplasia and basal cell and squamous cell cancer. It remains unclear whether the same mechanisms apply to melanoma risk. For all 3 types of cancer, increasing intermittent or recreational sun exposure and total sun exposure are linked to increased risk. Artificial UV radiation, specifically indoor tanning, is also associated with an increased risk of skin cancer. Indoor tanning before age 35 years, for more than 10 tanning sessions over a lifetime, and for longer than 1 year have been linked to increased cancer risk.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comments</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from October 10 to November 6, 2017. In response to public comments, the USPSTF clarified the definition of fair skin type for the purposes of this recommendation. Comments requested more details about the behavioral counseling interventions, and the USPSTF provided additional information on implementation strategies. Several comments requested clarification about why skin self-examination is included in this recommendation; the USPSTF clarified that this recommendation addresses several preventive counseling interventions, including evidence about primary care clinicians counseling patients to perform skin self-examination. The USPSTF also added suggestions for practice regarding the I statement, information on newer technologies, and further information on the evidence for the different age ranges in the recommendations.</p>","topic":"Skin Cancer Prevention: Behavioral Counseling","keywords":"Skin Cancer","pubDate":"2018-03-20","categories":["3"],"tool":["181","183","182"]},"401":{"topicType":"Screening","topicYear":2018,"uspstfAlias":"peripheral-artery-disease-in-adults-screening-with-the-ankle-brachial-index","specific":[424],"title":"Peripheral Artery Disease and Cardiovascular Disease: Screening and Risk Assessment With the Ankle-Brachial Index","rationale":"<h2>Rationale</h2><h3 align=\"left\">Importance</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Peripheral artery disease is a manifestation of atherosclerosis in the lower limbs. It can impair walking and, in severe cases, can lead to tissue loss, infection, and amputation. In addition to morbidity directly caused by PAD, patients with PAD are at increased risk for CVD events, because atherosclerosis is a systemic disease that also causes coronary and cerebrovascular events. The most recent data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1999-2004) show that 5.9% of the US population 40 years or older has a low ABI (&le;0.9), which indicates the presence of PAD. The true prevalence of PAD is difficult to establish, because more than half of persons with a low ABI are asymptomatic or have atypical symptoms and because population screening studies that use a gold standard diagnostic test are lacking.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Detection</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the accuracy of the ABI for identifying asymptomatic persons with PAD who can benefit from treatment.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Benefits of Early Detection and Intervention or Treatment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to assess whether screening for and treatment of PAD in asymptomatic patients leads to clinically important benefits in either preventing the progression of PAD or preventing CVD events.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Harms of Early Detection and Intervention or Treatment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the direct harms of screening, beyond the time needed for testing, are minimal. Other harms may include false-positive test results, exposure to gadolinium or contrast dye if magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) or computed tomography angiography (CTA) is used to confirm a diagnosis of PAD, anxiety, labeling, and opportunity costs. If a low ABI finding prompts further evaluation for CVD, harms could include those attributable to stress testing and angiography. The harms of preventive treatment for PAD or CVD include bleeding (with aspirin use) and possibly diabetes (with statin use).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">USPSTF Assessment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for PAD and CVD risk with the ABI in asymptomatic adults.</p>","clinical":"<h2>Clinical Considerations</h2><h3 align=\"left\"><a id=\"consider\" name=\"consider\"></a>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This recommendation applies to asymptomatic adults without a known diagnosis of PAD, CVD, or severe chronic kidney disease.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In deciding whether to screen for PAD with the ABI in asymptomatic adults, clinicians should consider the following factors.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4 align=\"left\">Potential Preventable Burden</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The true prevalence of PAD in the general population is not known. Data from the 1999-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey show that 5.9% of the US population 40 years or older (7.1 million adults) has a low ABI (&le;0.9), which may indicate the presence of PAD.<sup>1</sup> The most recent prevalence data available are from a screening trial of Danish men aged 65 to 74 years, which identified a prevalence of 11% when PAD was defined as an ABI less than 0.9 or greater than 1.4. Two-thirds of identified patients reported no intermittent claudication, which is considered to be the classic symptom of PAD.<sup>2</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A 2016 systematic review<sup>3</sup> found that over 5 years of follow-up, approximately 7% of patients with asymptomatic PAD developed intermittent claudication and approximately 21% of patients with intermittent claudication progressed to critical limb ischemia. In addition to the risk of worsening symptoms in the lower limbs, a low ABI is associated with increased risk of CVD events. Studies suggest that the 5-year cumulative incidence of cardiovascular mortality is 9% (95% CI, 7%-12%) in asymptomatic patients with a low ABI and 13% (95% CI, 9%-17%) in symptomatic patients with a low ABI; patients with a normal ABI had an average incidence of 5% (95% CI, 4%-6%).<sup>3</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h4 align=\"left\">Potential Harms</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Although minimal harms are associated with the ABI test, subsequent harms are possible. False-positive test results, false-negative test results, anxiety, labeling, and exposure to gadolinium or contrast dye from confirmatory MRA or CTA may occur, while further evaluation of CVD risk may involve stress testing or angiography. If the ABI is used to determine the need for pharmacologic treatment to reduce CVD risk, patients could receive additional treatment with resulting adverse effects or be reclassified to a lower risk category and potentially discontinue treatment that may be beneficial.<sup>4</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h4 align=\"left\">Current Practice</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>An older study of US primary care practices found that 12% to 13% reported using the ABI for CVD screening weekly or monthly, 6% to 8% reported using it annually, and 68% reported never using it. However, the study was conducted more than a decade ago and may not reflect current practice.<sup>5</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Assessment of Risk</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to older age, major risk factors for PAD include diabetes, current smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, obesity, and physical inactivity, with current smoking and diabetes showing the strongest association.<sup>6</sup> Although women have a slightly lower ABI compared with men, the prevalence of low ABI does not appear to vary significantly by sex after adjusting for age.<sup>4</sup> Among healthy US men aged 40 to 75 years without a history of CVD, the risk for PAD over 25 years in the absence of 4 conventional cardiovascular risk factors (current smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, or type 2 diabetes) is rare (9 cases per 100,000 men per year). These 4 risk factors account for 75% of all cases of PAD, and at least 1 of these risk factors is present at the time of PAD diagnosis in 96% of men.<sup>7</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Screening Tests</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Resting ABI is the most commonly used measurement for detection of PAD in clinical settings, although variation in measurement protocols may lead to differences in the ABI values obtained. Ankle-brachial index is calculated as the systolic blood pressure obtained at the ankle divided by the systolic blood pressure obtained at the brachial artery while the patient is lying down. A ratio of less than 1 (typically defined as &lt;0.9) is considered abnormal and is commonly used to define PAD. Data on the accuracy of the ABI in asymptomatic populations are limited. One study of men and women older than 70 years reported that an ABI of less than 0.9 had a sensitivity of 15% to 20% and a specificity of 99% compared with whole-body MRA.<sup>8,9</sup> Physical examination has low sensitivity for detecting mild PAD in asymptomatic persons.<sup>4</sup> Although femoral bruit (vascular murmur at the femoral artery), pulse abnormalities, or ischemic skin changes significantly increase the likelihood ratio for low ABI (&le;0.9), these signs indicate moderate to severe obstruction of blood flow or clinical disease.<sup>10</sup> The clinical benefits and harms of screening for PAD with a physical examination have not been well evaluated, although such screening is often performed.<sup>4</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Treatment and Interventions</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Because PAD is a manifestation of systemic atherosclerosis in the lower limbs, treatment of PAD has 2 potential targets: reducing morbidity and mortality from lower limb ischemia and preventing CVD events due to systemic atherosclerosis. Treatment of PAD focuses on improving outcomes in symptomatic patients (eg, increasing walking distance and quality of life by improving symptoms of intermittent claudication and leg function, preventing or reducing limb complications, and preserving limb viability). Interventions to prevent CVD events include smoking cessation, lowering cholesterol levels, managing high blood pressure, and antiplatelet therapy. However, because the major risk factors for PAD are also used to calculate CVD risk, patients with a low ABI may already be recommended for these treatments.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Additional Approaches to Prevention</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute provides resources on assessing cardiovascular risk, including a link to an online version of the Pooled Cohort Equations,<sup>11</sup> as well as resources on preventing PAD.<sup>12</sup> Healthy People 2020 provides a database of evidence-based resources for achieving Healthy People 2020 goals, including interventions to prevent CVD.<sup>13</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Useful Resources</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF has made recommendations on many factors related to CVD prevention, including screening for high blood pressure,<sup>14</sup> statin use,<sup>15</sup> screening for diabetes,<sup>16</sup> counseling on smoking cessation,<sup>17</sup> counseling on healthful diet and physical activity,<sup>18</sup> and CVD risk assessment with nontraditional risk factors.<sup>19</sup> In addition, the USPSTF recommends use of low-dose aspirin by certain adults at increased risk for CVD.<sup>20</sup></p><h2>Other Considerations</h2><h3 align=\"left\">Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Large, population-based, randomized trials of screening vs no screening are needed to determine whether screening for PAD with the ABI improves clinical outcomes. One ongoing study in Denmark has published preliminary results; however, that study limited enrollment to men aged 65 to 74 years and included screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm and high blood pressure, making it difficult to evaluate the benefit of screening with the ABI alone.<sup>2</sup> Two other ongoing trials that include the ABI as part of a screening bundle may have the same limitation.<sup>21,22</sup> Future studies, in addition to isolating the effect of individual tests, should address the population of persons at potentially increased risk for PAD who are not already receiving interventions to reduce cardiovascular risk, because this is the population most likely to benefit from an additional screening intervention. Studies of screening with the ABI and interventions to stop disease progression in the lower limbs in more diverse populations (eg, women, racial/ethnic minorities, or persons with a lower socioeconomic status) and populations at high risk (ie, persons with diabetes) would also be valuable.</p><h2>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h2><p>This recommendation replaces the 2013 USPSTF recommendation. Although the USPSTF expanded its evidence review to include a broader population and range of interventions, the USPSTF&rsquo;s recommendation remains an I statement.</p>","other":"<h2>Recommendations of Others</h2><p>The American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association released joint practice guidelines recommending screening with the ABI in patients at increased risk, including adults 65 years or older, adults 50 years or older with risk factors for atherosclerosis or a family history of PAD, and adults younger than 50 years with diabetes and 1 other risk factor for atherosclerosis.<sup>31</sup> In 2015, the Society for Vascular Surgery recommended against screening with the ABI in adults in the absence of risk factors, history, signs, or symptoms of PAD; however, screening is considered reasonable in adults at higher risk (defined as age older than 70 years, current smoking, or diabetes; abnormal pulse examination; or other established CVD).<sup>32</sup> In 2013, the American Academy of Family Physicians concluded that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for PAD and CVD risk with the ABI in asymptomatic adults.<sup>33</sup></p>","discussion":"<h2>Discussion</h2><h3 align=\"left\">Burden of Disease</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The most recent data (1999-2004) show that 5.9% of US adults 40 years or older have a low ABI.<sup>1</sup> In the United States, a low ABI (typically &lt;0.9) is considered diagnostic for PAD in clinical practice, especially in the presence of symptoms. However, evidence that the ABI is an accurate screening test in asymptomatic adults is limited, so the actual prevalence of PAD is not known. When persons with known coronary artery disease or cerebrovascular disease are excluded, the reported prevalence of PAD in studies is 4.7%.<sup>1</sup> Prevalence is higher in older populations; the prevalence of low ABI is 1.9% in adults aged 40 to 59 years, 8.1% in those aged 60 to 74 years, and 17.5% in those 75 years or older.<sup>23</sup> However, the natural history of screen-detected PAD, including the development of morbidity and mortality directly related to atherosclerosis in the lower limbs, is not well known. Therefore, the true burden of asymptomatic PAD is difficult to determine.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Scope of Review</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>To update its 2013 recommendation, the USPSTF reviewed the evidence on whether screening for PAD with the ABI in generally asymptomatic adults reduces morbidity or mortality from PAD or CVD. The current review expanded on the previous review to include persons with diabetes and interventions that include supervised exercise and physical therapy intended to improve outcomes in the lower limbs.<sup>4,24</sup> The USPSTF also considered in a separate review whether the ABI improves CVD risk prediction when added to current risk assessment models (ie, Framingham Risk Score and the Pooled Cohort Equations).<sup>25</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Accuracy of Screening Tests</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In practice, low ABI is used as a surrogate marker for PAD; however, its accuracy as a screening tool for PAD in asymptomatic primary care populations has not been well studied. Only 1 fair-quality study evaluated the ABI as a screening test compared with a reference standard in a relevant population.<sup>9</sup> That study was conducted in Sweden and included 306 participants, all of whom were aged 70 years at study entry. The mean interval between the ABI and the reference standard (whole-body MRA) was 16 months. The prevalence of PAD detected by MRA in the study population was relatively high at 28%. When whole-body MRA showing at least 50% stenosis in the pelvic or lower-limb arteries was used as the reference standard, an ABI of less than 0.9 had a sensitivity of 15% to 20% and a specificity of 99%. Because of its low sensitivity and high specificity, the positive and negative predictive values for the ABI in this study were 82% to 83% and 80% to 84%, respectively, depending on the leg. There were no subgroup analyses to examine whether accuracy results varied by subpopulation. The previous USPSTF review used evidence in symptomatic adults to assess the potential accuracy of the ABI in asymptomatic patients; the current review did not reassess this literature. Although studies of test performance in symptomatic patients are helpful, asymptomatic patients may have less severe disease than symptomatic patients, so it is uncertain whether the sensitivity and specificity of the ABI found in studies of symptomatic patients would be applicable to asymptomatic patients.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no population-based, randomized trials of the effect of PAD screening alone. One study, the Viborg Vascular (or VIVA) screening trial, assessed the effects of a screening bundle (combined screening for PAD, abdominal aortic aneurysm, and high blood pressure), reporting an absolute reduction in mortality of 0.006 (95% CI, 0.001-0.011) in the screening group at 5 years.<sup>26</sup> However, the applicability of these results to screening for PAD in the United States is uncertain, given that the contribution of the individual tests was not measured and that screening for high blood pressure is supported by evidence-based guidelines in the United States, as is screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm in selected high-risk populations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Four studies, 2 of aspirin therapy and 2 of exercise therapy, addressed treatment of asymptomatic patients with low ABI or PAD. Both aspirin studies were large, good-quality, randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that addressed whether asymptomatic men and women with low ABI (defined as &le;0.95 and &le;0.99, respectively) could benefit from daily aspirin therapy (100 mg/d). One study, Aspirin for Asymptomatic Atherosclerosis (N = 3350), enrolled men and women aged 50 to 75 years, with a mean follow-up of 8.2 years.<sup>27</sup> The second study, the Prevention of Progression of Arterial Disease and Diabetes (POPADAD) trial (N = 1276), enrolled patients 40 years or older with diabetes, with a median follow-up of 6.7 years.<sup>28</sup> Neither study showed any significant difference in CVD events or mortality. Both studies reported no significant differences in development of intermittent claudication, and the POPADAD trial found no significant difference in PAD revascularization, bypass surgery, angioplasty, or amputation. In terms of subgroups analysis, there did not appear to be a difference in treatment effect based on age or sex.<sup>4</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 2 exercise studies were a small (N = 50), fair-quality US-based RCT with 12 weeks of follow-up<sup>29</sup> and a good-quality Australian RCT (n = 882) with 1 year of follow-up.<sup>30</sup> The intervention in both trials was a combination of risk factor modification and measures to increase physical activity. One-fourth of the participants in the US study and slightly more than half of the participants in the Australian study were asymptomatic. Both studies found no statistically significant differences in their primary outcome of walking distance or secondary outcomes of quality of life or self-reported symptoms, although the US study reported an improvement only in the mean stair climbing component of the Walking Impairment Questionnaire.<sup>29,30</sup> There was no difference in development of PAD symptoms or improvement in quality of life. There was no evidence addressing whether subpopulations at greater risk for PAD had a differential treatment effect.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>No studies directly addressed the harms of screening for PAD with the ABI. Harms resulting from testing may include false-positive test results (about 1%), false-negative test results (80% to 85%), exposure to gadolinium or contrast dye from confirmatory MRA or CTA, anxiety, labeling, and opportunity costs.<sup>4</sup> The time and resources needed to screen with the ABI in a primary care setting may detract from other prevention activities that may have more benefit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two trials addressed the harms of aspirin treatment in asymptomatic persons. The Aspirin for Asymptomatic Atherosclerosis trial reported a nonsignificant trend toward increased major bleeding events requiring hospitalization in the aspirin therapy vs placebo group (hazard ratio, 1.71 [95% CI, 0.99-2.97]).<sup>27</sup> The POPADAD trial reported a numerical decrease in hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accidents in the aspirin group, but the results were imprecise and not statistically significant.<sup>28</sup> The 2 exercise trials did not report on harms.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found few data on the accuracy of the ABI for identifying asymptomatic persons who can benefit from treatment of PAD or CVD. Studies addressing the benefits of treating screen-detected patients with PAD are sparse; 2 good-quality studies showed no benefit of using the ABI to manage daily aspirin therapy in unselected populations, and 2 studies showed no benefit from exercise therapy. No studies addressed the harms of screening, although the potential exists for overdiagnosis, labeling, and opportunity costs. Studies that addressed the harms of treatment showed nonsignificant results. Therefore, the USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient and that the balance of benefits and harms of screening for PAD with the ABI in asymptomatic adults cannot be determined.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Peripheral artery disease is generally considered a manifestation of systemic atherosclerosis. Detection when a patient is asymptomatic may suggest significant atherosclerosis in other vessels, such as the heart or brain, and patients may therefore be at risk for types of CVD other than PAD. Early detection and intervention to reduce atherosclerotic progression and prevent future CVD events could improve health outcomes compared with intervention strategies used in the absence of PAD screening. Patients with minimal or atypical symptoms may limit activity to avoid symptoms, leading to further deterioration. In this case, screening and treatment could theoretically prevent deterioration. However, a substantial number of asymptomatic persons with low ABI may never develop clinical signs or symptoms of CVD or PAD but would still be subjected to the harms of testing and subsequent treatments.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from January 16, 2018, to February 12, 2018. Several comments expressed concern that the USPSTF did not issue a separate positive recommendation for persons at higher risk of developing PAD. This population would include older adults and patients with diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, and current tobacco use. The USPSTF found the evidence addressing screening for PAD in high-risk, asymptomatic populations to be limited, with no compelling evidence to support differential screening or treatment in subpopulations at greater risk. In addition, patients in higher-risk groups (such as persons with diabetes and older adults) would likely already be candidates for interventions based on their global CVD risk, raising concern about the clinical significance of screening for additional risk factors (ie, asymptomatic PAD). The USPSTF added language to the &ldquo;Accuracy of Screening Tests&rdquo; and &ldquo;Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment&rdquo; sections to clarify this point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Comments also raised concern that an I statement could have a negative effect on health care disparities for PAD. These comments cited evidence that the prevalence of PAD is disproportionately higher among racial/ethnic minorities and low-socioeconomic populations, and noted that the I statement could discourage testing and perpetuate disparities in treatment and outcomes. The USPSTF recognizes these well-established disparities in care. However, the evidence on screening and treatment in these groups is currently lacking, and the USPSTF was unable to determine the overall balance of benefits and harms. Future research should include diverse populations and report on their outcomes. The USPSTF added language to the &ldquo;Research Needs and Gaps&rdquo; section to clarify this point.</p>","topic":"Peripheral Artery Disease and Cardiovascular Disease: Screening and Risk Assessment With the Ankle-Brachial Index","keywords":"PAD|Peripheral Artery Disease|ABI|Ankle Brachial Index","pubDate":"2018-07-10","categories":["5"],"tool":["184","185"]},"402":{"topicType":"Preventive medication","topicYear":2018,"uspstfAlias":"vitamin-d-calcium-or-combined-supplementation-for-the-primary-prevention-of-fractures-in-adults-preventive-medication","specific":[410,408,409],"title":"Vitamin D, Calcium, or Combined Supplementation for the Primary Prevention of Fractures in Community-Dwelling Adults: Preventive Medication","rationale":"<h2>Rationale</h2><h3>Importance</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Approximately 2 million osteoporotic fractures occurred in the United States in 2005.<sup>1, 2</sup> Within 1 year of experiencing a hip fracture, many patients are unable to walk independently, more than half require assistance with activities of daily living,<sup>3, 4</sup> and 20% to 30% of patients will die.<sup>5</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Benefits of Preventive Medication</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to determine the effects of vitamin D and calcium supplementation, alone or combined, on the incidence of fractures in men and premenopausal women.

These recommendations do not apply to persons with a history of osteoporotic fractures, increased risk for falls, or a diagnosis of osteoporosis or vitamin D deficiency.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statements</h3>\r\n\r\n<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Approximately 2 million osteoporotic fractures occurred in the United States in 2005.<sup>2</sup> The health burden of fractures is substantial in the older adult population. Twenty percent to 30% of patients die within 1 year of a hip fracture, with significantly higher mortality rates in men than in women.<sup>5</sup> Nearly 40% of persons who experience a fracture are unable to walk independently at 1 year, and 60% require assistance with at least 1 essential activity of daily living.<sup>3, 4</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Low bone mass, older age, and history of falls are major risk factors for incident osteoporotic fractures.<sup>1, 6</sup> Ten percent to 15% of falls result in fractures,<sup>6</sup> and nearly all hip fractures are related to a fall.<sup>7</sup> Other risks factors for low bone mass and fractures include female sex, smoking, use of glucocorticoids, and use of other medications that impair bone metabolism (eg, aromatase inhibitors).<sup>8-11</sup> Most fractures (71%) occur among women,<sup>2</sup> and an estimated 74% of all fractures that occur in women are among those 65 years or older.<sup>6</sup> Although the risk for fractures in premenopausal women increases with lower peak bone mass, absolute fracture risk in premenopausal women is very low compared with that in postmenopausal women.<sup>12</sup> Although fractures occur more frequently in women, mortality rates after a hip fracture are significantly higher in men than in women.<sup>2, 13</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The large Women&rsquo;s Health Initiative (WHI) trial (n=36,282), which studied daily supplementation with 400 IU of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> (cholecalciferol) and 1000 mg of calcium, reported no significant reduction in any fracture outcome;<sup>14</sup> thus, the USPSTF concluded that supplementation with 400 IU or less of vitamin D and 1000 mg or less of calcium does not prevent fractures. Studies of supplementation with higher doses of vitamin D and calcium (alone or combined) showed inconsistent results and were frequently underpowered to detect differences; thus, the USPSTF concluded that the evidence on supplementation with higher doses of vitamin D and calcium to prevent fractures is inadequate.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Potential Harms</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The WHI trial found a statistically significant increase in the incidence of kidney stones in women taking vitamin D and calcium compared with women taking placebo.<sup>14</sup> For every 273 women who received supplementation over a 7-year follow-up period, 1 woman was diagnosed with a urinary tract stone. In addition, a recent study<sup>15</sup> of combined vitamin D and calcium supplementation found findings consistent with those from the WHI trial, although the increase was not statistically significant. Another recent study<sup>16, 17</sup> found no increase in incident cardiovascular disease with high-dose vitamin D supplementation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a separate recommendation statement,<sup>18</sup> the USPSTF found that vitamin D supplementation does not reduce the number of falls or the number of persons who experience a fall. A single study suggested that an annual high dose of vitamin D (500,000 IU) may even be associated with a greater number of injurious falls and a greater number of persons experiencing falls and fractures.<sup>19</sup> The USPSTF now recommends against vitamin D supplementation to prevent falls in community-dwelling older adults.<sup>18</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Current Practice</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Vitamin D and calcium supplementation are often recommended for women, especially postmenopausal women, to prevent fractures, although actual use is uncertain. Based on 2011&ndash;2012 data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, an estimated 27% of men and 35% of women older than 20 years take a vitamin D supplement, and 26% of men and 33% of women take a calcium supplement.<sup>20</sup> The exact dosage of supplementation is not known.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Other Approaches to Prevention</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF recommends screening for osteoporosis in women 65 years or older and in younger women at increased risk.<sup>21</sup> The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for vitamin D deficiency in asymptomatic adults.<sup>22</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF recently updated its recommendation on interventions to prevent falls in community-dwelling older adults.<sup>18</sup> The USPSTF assessed the effect of vitamin D to prevent falls in older adults at average and increased risk for falls without vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that vitamin D supplementation does not prevent falls. The USPSTF also found that exercise can prevent falls in community-dwelling older adults at increased risk for falls; multifactorial interventions may also be effective in some persons as well.<sup>18, 19</sup></p><h2>Other Considerations</h2><h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Research is needed to determine whether daily supplementation with doses greater than 400 IU of vitamin D and greater than 1000 mg of calcium reduces fracture incidence in postmenopausal women and in older men. Prospective studies should assess the potential benefits of vitamin D and calcium supplementation in premenopausal women on fracture incidence later in life. Studies need to be adequately powered and should evaluate consistent fracture outcomes. Studies are also needed to evaluate the effects of vitamin D supplementation on diverse populations. Because white women have the highest risk for osteoporotic fractures, most fracture prevention studies have been conducted in this population, and it is difficult to extrapolate results to nonwhite populations. In addition, more studies evaluating the potential harms of supplementation are needed, particularly studies on calcium and potential adverse cardiovascular outcomes.</p><h2>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h2><p>This recommendation is consistent with the 2013 USPSTF recommendation on vitamin D supplementation, with or without calcium, to prevent fractures.<sup>36</sup> The USPSTF added evidence on calcium supplementation alone to the evidence review for this recommendation; however, the evidence was too limited to make a separate recommendation about calcium supplementation alone. Evidence from more recent studies confirms that the evidence on fracture prevention with doses of vitamin D greater than 400 IU daily is inconsistent and inadequate, because of underpowering of studies at higher doses. Newer evidence confirms an increased risk for kidney stones with combined vitamin D and calcium supplementation and also suggests no increased incidence of cardiovascular disease with vitamin D supplementation.</p>","other":"<h2>Recommendations of Others</h2><p>The Institute of Medicine (now the National Academy of Medicine)<sup>37</sup> and the World Health Organization<sup>38</sup> recommend standards for adequate daily intake of calcium and vitamin D as a part of overall health. Neither organization has recommendations specific to fracture prevention. The Institute of Medicine notes the challenge of determining dietary reference intakes given the complex interrelationship between calcium and vitamin D, the inconsistency of studies examining bone health outcomes, and the need to limit sun exposure to minimize skin cancer risk. The National Osteoporosis Foundation supports the Institute of Medicine&rsquo;s recommendations regarding calcium consumption and recommends that adults 50 years or older consume 800 to 1000 IU of vitamin D daily.<sup>39</sup> The Endocrine Society recommends that adults 65 years or older consume 800 IU of vitamin D daily for the prevention of falls and fractures.<sup>40</sup> The American Geriatric Society recommends that adults 65 years or older take daily vitamin D supplementation of at least 1000 IU as well as calcium to reduce the risk for fractures and falls.<sup>41</sup></p>","discussion":"<h2>Discussion</h2><h3>Burden of Disease</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Because of the aging population, osteoporotic fractures are an increasingly important cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Approximately 2 million osteoporotic fractures occurred in the United States in 2005, and annual incidence is projected to increase to more than 3 million fractures by 2025.<sup>2</sup> Nearly half of all women older than 50 years will experience an osteoporotic fracture during their lifetime.<sup>23</sup> Fractures are associated with chronic pain, disability, and decreased quality of life. Hip fractures significantly increase morbidity and mortality. From 2004&ndash;2014, hip fractures alone accounted for approximately 300,000 hospitalizations annually in the United States.<sup>24</sup> During the first 3 months after a hip fracture, a patient&rsquo;s mortality risk is 5 to 8 times that of a similarly aged person living in the community without a fracture.<sup>25</sup> Nearly 20% of patients with hip fracture subsequently receive care in a long-term care facility.<sup>23</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF commissioned a systematic evidence review on vitamin D, calcium, and combined supplementation for the primary prevention of fractures in community-dwelling adults.<sup>1, 26</sup> The review excluded studies conducted in populations with a known disorder related to bone metabolism (eg, osteoporosis or vitamin D deficiency), taking medications known to be associated with osteoporosis (eg, long-term steroids), or with a previous fracture. The review also excluded studies that recruited participants based on a history of falls or high risk for falls, because these populations are covered in a separate evidence review, and studies conducted in institutional care settings, such as long-term care facilities, because persons living in these settings are often at a very increased risk for falls. Evaluating evidence on the use of vitamin D to treat vitamin D deficiency or to treat osteoporosis is beyond the scope of this review.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Preventive Medication</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed evidence from 8 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) on vitamin D, calcium, or combined supplementation for the primary prevention of fractures; 4 trials evaluated vitamin D supplementation (n=10,606), 2 trials evaluated calcium supplementation (n=339), and 2 trials evaluated combined vitamin D and calcium supplementation (n=36,727).<sup>1, 26</sup> Four studies included men (representing data from 5900 men) and 4 studies were conducted exclusively in women (total of 41,772 women across all 8 studies). The mean age of study participants ranged from 53 to 80 years. In the 5 studies reporting race/ethnicity, 83% to 100% of participants were white; the remaining 3 studies did not report this information. Four of the studies were conducted in the United States, while 4 were conducted in the United Kingdom, Finland, the Netherlands, and New Zealand. Fracture outcomes varied and included total fractures, hip fractures, major osteoporotic fractures, nonvertebral fractures, vertebral fractures (clinical, morphometric, or both), upper extremity fractures, lower arm/wrist fractures, and peripheral fractures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Four studies reported on the effect of vitamin D supplementation on fracture prevention.<sup>1</sup> Two studies evaluated daily doses of 400 IU or less (n=2810)<sup>27, 28</sup> and did not find any significant difference in any fracture outcome. The primary aim of the larger study (n=2578) (28) was reduction in incidence of hip and other osteoporotic fractures. Two studies evaluated higher doses of vitamin D: a loading dose of 200,000 IU followed by 100,000 IU monthly (n=5110)<sup>16, 17</sup> and 100,000 IU every 4 months (n=2686).<sup>29</sup> These 2 studies reported inconsistent findings. The larger study did not find any significant difference in nonvertebral fractures (absolute risk difference [ARD], 0.75% [95% CI, -0.51% to 2.04%]; adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.19 [95% CI, 0.94 to 1.50]); however, the primary outcome of the study was not fracture prevention.<sup>1, 16</sup> The smaller study found a reduction in total fractures (ARD, -2.26% [95% CI, -4.53% to 0.00%]; age-adjusted relative risk [RR], 0.78 [95% CI, 0.61 to 0.99]) but nonsignificant reductions in hip fractures (ARD, -0.23% [95% CI, -1.20% to 0.74%]; age-adjusted RR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.47 to 1.53]) and clinical vertebral fractures (ARD, -0.75% [95% CI, -1.73% to 0.23%]; age-adjusted RR, 0.63 [95% CI, 0.35 to 1.14]).<sup>1, 29</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two studies reported on the effect of calcium supplementation on fracture prevention (n=339).<sup>1, 30, 31</sup> The studies evaluated daily doses of 1200 and 1600 mg. Neither study found a significant difference in fracture outcomes with calcium supplementation, although neither study was adequately powered to detect differences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two studies evaluated the effect of combined vitamin D and calcium supplementation on fracture prevention (n=36,727).<sup>1, 14, 32</sup> The much larger WHI trial (n=36,282), which evaluated a daily dose of 400 IU of vitamin D with 1000 mg of calcium compared with placebo, was adequately powered to detect the effect of combined vitamin D and calcium supplementation on risk for hip fractures and found no statistically significant difference between groups (ARD, -0.14% [95% CI, -0.34% to 0.07%]; HR, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.72 to 1.08]).<sup>14</sup> The WHI trial also did not find any statistically significant difference in total fractures (ARD, -0.35% [95% CI, -1.02% to 0.31%]; HR, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.91 to 1.02]) or clinical vertebral fractures (ARD, -0.09% [95% CI, -0.30% to 0.12%]; HR, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.74 to 1.10]). However, this trial allowed participants to use calcium and vitamin D supplements outside of the study protocol, which may have biased results toward a null effect. The other, much smaller trial (n=445) evaluated 700 IU of vitamin D with 500 mg of calcium daily compared with placebo and did not find any significant difference in hip fractures (ARD, -0.50% [95% CI, -1.88% to 0.78%]; RR, 0.36 [95% CI, 0.01 to 8.78]). This trial found a reduction in nonvertebral fractures with vitamin D and calcium supplementation, which was one of its primary aims (ARD, -6.99% [95% CI, -12.71% to -1.27%]; RR, 0.46 [95% CI, 0.23 to 0.90]).<sup>32</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Potential Harms of Preventive Medication</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF evaluated evidence from 9 RCTs on the harms of vitamin D, calcium, or combined supplementation.<sup>1, 26</sup> Four studies reported on harms of vitamin D supplementation alone (n=10,599) (the same 4 studies mentioned previously), 3 studies reported on the harms of calcium supplementation alone (n=1292), and 3 studies (including 1 of the studies reporting on harms of calcium supplementation alone) reported on harms of combined vitamin D and calcium supplementation (n=39,659). One study was conducted in men only, and 3 other studies included men (total of 5991 men across studies). The mean age of study participants ranged from 53 to 80 years. In the 4 studies that reported race/ethnicity, 83% to 100% of study participants were white; the remaining 5 studies did not report this information. Four of the studies were conducted in the United States; the other 5 studies were conducted in Finland, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and New Zealand (2 studies). The USPSTF particularly sought evidence on the outcomes of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and kidney stones.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vitamin D, with or without calcium, had no statistically significant effect on all-cause mortality or incident cardiovascular disease compared with placebo. Four studies (n=10,599) reported on mortality outcomes with vitamin D supplementation alone; the pooled ARD was -0.74% (95% CI, -0.80% to 0.32%), and the pooled RR was 0.91 (95% CI, 0.82 to 1.01). Two studies reported on mortality outcomes with combined vitamin D and calcium supplementation, including the large WHI trial; ARDs were -0.19% and -0.36%, with 95% CIs spanning the null effect. However, none of these studies were adequately powered to detect mortality differences. Three studies reported on incident cardiovascular outcomes with vitamin D supplementation, including 1 good-quality study (n=5110) in which cardiovascular disease incidence was the primary outcome.<sup>16, 17</sup> Various outcomes were reported, including ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular disease, and stroke. ARDs ranged from -0.72% to 1.79%, with all 95% CIs spanning the null effect. The WHI trial also reported on incident cardiovascular outcomes with combined vitamin D and calcium supplementation and found no significant increase in myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease, stroke, venous thromboembolism, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or hospitalizations for heart failure; ARDs ranged from -0.16% to 0.12%, with all 95% CIs including zero. The evidence on calcium supplementation alone suggested no increased incidence of all-cause mortality or cardiovascular disease but was limited to 1 study.<sup>33</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Evidence on the effects of vitamin D or calcium supplementation alone on cancer incidence was inconsistent and imprecise. Combined vitamin D and calcium supplementation did not increase cancer incidence; the pooled ARD from 3 RCTs (n=39,213) was -1.5% (95% CI, -3.3% to 0.4%).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Calcium supplementation alone for 2 to 4 years did not increase the incidence of kidney stones; the pooled ARD from 3 RCTs (n=1259) was 0.00% (95% CI, -0.88% to 0.87%), and the pooled RR was 0.68 (95% CI, 0.14 to 3.40). Based on evidence from 3 RCTs (n=39,659), combined vitamin D and calcium supplementation for 4 to 7 years increased the incidence of kidney stones; the pooled ARD was 0.33% (95% CI, 0.06% to 0.60%), and the pooled RR was 1.18 (95% CI, 1.04 to 1.35).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most commonly reported other adverse event associated with supplementation was constipation; however, this was not consistently reported across studies. A few studies reported on other serious adverse events, but these events were rare and noted by the authors to be unrelated to the study medication. In a separate evidence review commissioned by the USPSTF on interventions to prevent falls in community-dwelling older adults,<sup>19</sup> 1 study (n=2256) reported an increase in the number of persons experiencing a fall with a very high dose of vitamin D (500,000 IU per year) (adjusted incident rate ratio, 1.16 [95% CI, 1.03 to 1.31]).<sup>19, 34</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to estimate the benefits of vitamin D, calcium, or combined supplementation to prevent fractures in community-dwelling men and premenopausal women. The USPSTF concludes that there is insufficient evidence to estimate the net benefit of vitamin D, calcium, or combined supplementation to prevent fractures in community-dwelling men and premenopausal women. Because of the lack of effect on fracture incidence and the increased incidence of kidney stones in intervention groups, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that daily supplementation with 400 IU or less of vitamin D and 1000 mg or less of calcium has no net benefit for the primary prevention of fractures in community-dwelling, postmenopausal women. Although women enrolled in the WHI trial were predominately white, the lower risk for fractures in nonwhite women makes it very unlikely that a benefit would exist in this population. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on calcium supplementation alone, as well as on supplementation with doses greater than 400 IU of vitamin D and greater than 1000 mg of calcium in postmenopausal women. The USPSTF concludes that there is insufficient evidence to estimate the net benefit of supplementation with doses greater than 400 IU of vitamin D and greater than 1000 mg of calcium in postmenopausal women.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Calcium contributes to bone growth, and vitamin D helps bones absorb calcium. Normal, healthy bones turn over calcium constantly, replacing calcium loss with new calcium. The human body has 2 main sources of vitamin D. Cholecalciferol (vitamin D<sub>3</sub>), the larger source of vitamin D, is synthesized in the skin by UVB rays from the sun. Vitamin D<sub>3</sub> is converted to its active form through enzymatic processes in the liver and kidney. Ergocalciferol (vitamin D<sub>2</sub>) is consumed in the diet and can be found naturally in a few foods, such as mushrooms and egg yolks, but is more commonly consumed as a supplement or in fortified foods and beverages, such as milk, yogurt, and orange juice.<sup>35</sup> Most cells contain specific receptors for the active form of vitamin D. Stimulation of skeletal muscle receptors promotes protein synthesis, and vitamin D has a beneficial effect on muscle strength and balance. Vitamin D controls calcium absorption in the small intestines, interacts with parathyroid hormone to help maintain calcium homeostasis between the blood and bones, and is essential for bone growth and maintaining bone density. Obtaining insufficient amounts of vitamin D through diet or sun exposure can lead to inadequate levels of the hormone calcitriol (the active form of vitamin D), which in turn can lead to impaired absorption of dietary calcium. Consequently, the body uses calcium from skeletal stores, which can weaken existing bones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The current recommendation against supplementation with 400 IU or less of vitamin D and 1000 mg or less of calcium for the primary prevention of fractures is primarily based on the finding of no benefit with supplementation at lower doses. More evidence is needed to determine whether higher doses of supplementation may be more effective at preventing fractures. Although the risk for kidney stones could theoretically increase at higher doses of supplementation, the overall determination of net benefit or net harm will depend on whether a benefit in fracture prevention is also found at higher doses and, if so, what the magnitude of that benefit is.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from September 26, 2017, to October 24, 2017. To clarify which population the recommendation applies to, the USPSTF revised the title to &ldquo;Vitamin D, Calcium, or Combined Supplementation for the Primary Prevention of Fractures in Community-Dwelling Adults.&rdquo; Some comments expressed concern that the recommendation against supplementation with vitamin D would be misinterpreted by persons with known osteoporosis or vitamin D deficiency. Persons with known osteoporosis or vitamin D deficiency were excluded from the evidence review, and thus are excluded from the recommendation statement, as described in the &ldquo;Summary of Recommendations and Evidence&rdquo; and &ldquo;Patient Population Under Consideration&rdquo; sections. Other comments requested clarification of the role of vitamin D in persons with known osteoporosis or vitamin D deficiency. This is beyond the scope of the recommendation and has been clarified in the &ldquo;Scope of Review&rdquo; section. Some comments also expressed confusion over why a finding of &ldquo;insufficient evidence&rdquo; was issued for supplementation at higher doses if the USPSTF recommends against supplementation at lower doses. The recommendation against supplementation at lower doses was based on an overall assessment that supplementation at low doses provides no benefit. Evidence on the effect of supplementation on fractures at higher doses is conflicting, with some studies showing a reduction in certain fracture types at higher doses, and others showing no reduction or even an increase. More studies are needed to more clearly determine if supplementation with vitamin D, calcium, or both consistently prevents fractures. If future evidence shows a benefit, the magnitude of that benefit will need to be weighed against the magnitude of harms caused by supplementation (kidney stones).</p>","topic":"Vitamin D, Calcium, or Combined Supplementation for the Primary Prevention of Fractures in Community-Dwelling Adults: Preventive Medication","keywords":"Vitamin D|Calcium|Fractures","pubDate":"2018-04-17","categories":["4"],"tool":["186","165","187"]},"403":{"topicType":"Screening","topicYear":2018,"uspstfAlias":"cardiovascular-disease-risk-screening-with-electrocardiography","specific":[418,419],"title":"Cardiovascular Disease Risk: Screening With Electrocardiography","rationale":"<h2>Rationale</h2><h3>Importance</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Cardiovascular disease, which encompasses atherosclerotic conditions such as coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral arterial disease, is the most common cause of death among adults in the United States.

Reclassification into a higher-risk category might lead to more intensive medical management that could lower the risk of CVD events but might also result in harms, including adverse medication effects such as gastrointestinal bleeding and hepatic injury. Regardless of ECG findings, persons who are already at high risk of CVD events should receive intensive risk factor modification. Persons who are classified as low risk are unlikely to benefit from screening with ECG.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For persons in certain occupations, such as pilots and operators of heavy equipment, for whom sudden incapacitation or death may endanger the safety of others, considerations other than the health benefit to the patient may influence the decision to screen with ECG to prevent CVD events.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Potential Harms</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>In all risk groups, an abnormal ECG finding (a true-positive or false-positive result) can lead to invasive confirmatory testing and treatment that have the potential for serious harm, including unnecessary radiation exposure. Two studies of asymptomatic adults with diabetes reported that 6% and 12% of patients who were screened with exercise ECG subsequently underwent angiography, and 3% to 5% underwent revascularization, without evidence of benefit to the study patients.<sup>1, 2</sup> Angiography and revascularization are associated with harms, including bleeding, contrast-induced nephropathy, cardiac arrhythmia, stroke, myocardial infarction, coronary artery dissection, allergic reaction to the contrast agent, and death.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Current Practice</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Although many guideline groups recommend cardiovascular risk assessment, there are few data on how this is applied in clinical practice. Only 41% of respondents in a survey of more than 900 US clinicians reported using cardiovascular risk prediction equations in practice.<sup>3</sup> There are few data on the use of ECG to assess CVD risk in asymptomatic patients in the United States. A Canadian retrospective cohort study from 2010 to 2015 found that 21.5% of low-risk primary care patients had an ECG within 30 days of an annual health examination, and the proportion of patients who had an ECG ranged across clinics from 1.8% to 76.1%.<sup>4</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Accurate identification of persons at high risk of CVD events provides the opportunity for more intensive risk factor management to reduce the likelihood of such an event. In addition, identifying persons at low risk may allow for a reduction in interventions among patients not likely to benefit from them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several factors are associated with an increased risk of CVD events, including older age, male sex, high blood pressure, current smoking, abnormal lipid levels, diabetes, obesity, and physical inactivity. Risk factors are combined in many ways to estimate a person&#39;s risk of a CVD event. Several calculators and models are available to quantify a person&#39;s 10-year risk of CVD events. The Framingham Risk Score,<sup>5</sup> based on data from the Framingham Heart Study, was one of the first widely used CVD risk assessment tools. Persons with a 10-year CVD event risk greater than 20% are generally considered high risk, those with a 10-year CVD event risk less than 10% are considered low risk, and those with a 10-year CVD event risk of 10% to 20% are considered intermediate risk. The Pooled Cohort Equations, introduced by the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association in 2013, include the same variables as the Framingham Risk Score as well as race/ethnicity and diabetes. Persons with a 10-year CVD event risk less than 7.5% are considered at low risk, and those with a 10-year CVD event risk of 7.5% or greater are considered at elevated risk.<sup>6</sup> The USPSTF recommends that clinicians use the Pooled Cohort Equations to assess CVD risk.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Both resting and exercise ECG are used for the diagnostic evaluation of suspected CVD, which has led to the suggestion that ECG could also be used to screen asymptomatic persons to identify those who would benefit from earlier, more intensive management of modifiable risk factors, preventive interventions, or both. Resting ECG records cardiac electrical activity while the patient is at rest, over a short period of time. Standard ECG testing is performed with 12 leads, although some tests use fewer leads. More recently, ECG leads have been built into blood pressure cuffs, smartphones, and other devices. Exercise ECG records cardiac electrical activity during physical exertion, often at a prespecified intensity level. The most common method of exercise ECG is the treadmill test, but other methods, such as those using bicycles and ergometers, have also been used. Both resting and exercise ECG look for markers of previous myocardial infarction, myocardial ischemia, and other cardiac abnormalities (such as left ventricular hypertrophy, bundle branch block, or arrhythmia) that may be associated with CVD or predict future CVD events.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Treatment and Interventions</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Asymptomatic adults at increased risk of CVD events are usually treated with a combination of diet and exercise modifications, lipid-lowering medications, aspirin, hypertension management, and interventions to encourage tobacco cessation. Recommendations for diet and exercise modifications, lipid-lowering medications, and aspirin are based on level of cardiovascular risk. Recent guidelines also recommend risk stratification of hypertension treatment;<sup>7</sup> the recommendation for tobacco cessation applies to all persons regardless of CVD risk.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Useful Resources</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF has made recommendations on many factors related to CVD prevention, including screening for high blood pressure,<sup>8</sup> use of statins,<sup>9</sup> counseling on smoking cessation,<sup>10</sup> and counseling to promote healthful diet and physical activity.<sup>11</sup> In addition, the USPSTF recommends low-dose aspirin use in certain persons at increased risk of CVD events.<sup>12</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other resources are also available from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute;<sup>13</sup> Centers for Disease Control and Prevention;<sup>14</sup> and Healthy People 2020.<sup>15</sup></p><h2>Other Considerations</h2><h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A considerable number of studies have reported hazard ratios and other measures of association between ECG changes and cardiovascular outcomes, so additional studies of this nature are unlikely to advance the field. Studies are needed that assess the incremental value of adding ECG to current CVD risk assessment tools or instruments to directly inform decision making; studies that examine patient outcomes would be most useful. Failing that, studies are needed that assess the added value of ECG for risk reclassification across clinically relevant risk thresholds. Any study of CVD risk assessment should also evaluate the harms associated with assessment as well as those related to additional testing and treatment. Studies that measure risk reclassification should report total, event, and nonevent Net Reclassification Indices, with corresponding confidence intervals, as well as measures of calibration and discrimination.</p><h2>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h2><p>This recommendation is an update of the 2012 USPSTF recommendation. As in 2012, the USPSTF continues to recommend against screening with ECG in adults at low risk, and the evidence remains insufficient on screening in adults at increased risk.<sup>17</sup></p>","other":"<h2>Recommendations of Others</h2><p>The American College of Physicians recommends against screening for CVD with resting or stress ECG in asymptomatic, low-risk adults.<sup>32</sup> The American College of Cardiology concludes that exercise ECG is rarely appropriate in asymptomatic adults at low global risk of CVD events, may be an appropriate option for adults at intermediate risk, and is appropriate for adults at high risk.<sup>33</sup> In 2012, the American Academy of Family Physicians recommended against screening with ECG in asymptomatic, low-risk persons.<sup>34</sup> The American College of Preventive Medicine recommends against routinely screening with resting or exercise ECG in the general adult population.<sup>35</sup></p>","discussion":"<h2>Discussion</h2><h3>Burden of Disease</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death among adults in the United States, accounting for 1 in 3 deaths. Although CVD remains a significant cause of illness and death, mortality from CVD has been decreasing over time in the United States. Currently, the annual incidence of new cases of myocardial infarction and cerebral vascular accident in the United States is 580,000 and 610,000, respectively.<sup>16</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2012, the USPSTF recommended against screening for coronary heart disease with ECG in low-risk adults (D recommendation) and issued an I statement for intermediate- and high-risk adults.<sup>17</sup> To update the prior recommendations, the USPSTF requested the current evidence review.<sup>18, 19</sup> In recognition of how the field has advanced, the current evidence review did not include association studies but addressed whether the addition of screening with resting or exercise ECG improves health outcomes compared with traditional CVD risk assessment in asymptomatic adults.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening Tests</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on whether screening with resting or exercise ECG improves calibration, discrimination, or risk reclassification when added to CVD risk assessment models using traditional risk factors. The USPSTF focused on evidence that ECG adds to current CVD risk assessment with the Framingham Risk Score or the Pooled Cohort Equations, because this could lead to change in treatments for patients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF identified 5 cohort studies (2 of which overlap with the previous review) that evaluated whether adding exercise ECG to current CVD risk assessment models improves calibration, discrimination, or reclassification. Four studies assessed whether exercise ECG improved calibration; 2 studies evaluated adding exercise ECG to the Framingham Risk Score,<sup>20, 21</sup> and the other 2 studies evaluated adding exercise ECG to other risk assessment models.<sup>22, 23</sup> The studies used different measures and showed mixed effects on calibration. Three studies assessed whether adding exercise ECG to the Framingham Risk Score<sup>21</sup> or other risk assessment models<sup>22, 24</sup> improved discrimination, and all found only small absolute improvements in area under the curve or C statistic (0.02 to 0.03). Only 1 risk assessment model development study evaluated whether adding exercise ECG improved risk reclassification. However, the study did not apply risk thresholds that currently determine treatment and only reported overall reclassification, not event and nonevent net reclassification.<sup>22</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF identified 9 cohort studies (1 of which overlapped with the previous review) that evaluated whether adding resting ECG to current CVD risk assessment models improves calibration, discrimination, or reclassification; 5 of these studies evaluated multiple ECG changes and 4 evaluated a single ECG change. Five studies evaluated adding resting ECG to the Framingham Risk Score,<sup>25-29</sup> and 1 of these studies<sup>29</sup> also evaluated adding resting ECG to the Pooled Cohort Equations. Adding resting ECG to existing CVD risk assessment models improved calibration for several CVD outcomes, although the strength of evidence was low and resulted in small or very small improvements in discrimination (absolute improvement in area under the curve or C statistic, 0.001 to 0.050). Two studies reported net reclassification when resting ECG was added to the Framingham Risk Score,<sup>18, 26, 27</sup> and 1 study<sup>29</sup> evaluated adding resting ECG to both the Framingham Risk Score and the Pooled Cohort Equations. There was a small to moderate improvement in reclassification but the studies did not present the full reclassification data, so it is difficult to determine whether the reclassification would change treatment. No 2 studies evaluated the same CVD risk assessment model, risk category threshold, or outcome.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF identified no studies that directly assessed whether adding resting ECG to current CVD risk assessment models improves cardiovascular outcomes for any risk group.<sup>18, 19</sup> The USPSTF identified 2 fair-quality randomized clinical trials of screening with exercise ECG in persons with diabetes (and therefore at increased risk of CVD) that found no difference in mortality or cardiovascular events.<sup>1, 2</sup> However, both trials fell far short of their intended enrollment and therefore were underpowered and had a relatively short time period (mean, 3.5 years) to detect a difference in cardiovascular outcomes.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Resting ECG has the potential for anxiety and labeling; however, the USPSTF was unable to find relevant studies on these harms. Exercise ECG has more potential for direct harms (eg, triggering a cardiovascular event or musculoskeletal injury), but survey data of symptomatic patients suggests that these harms are very rare.<sup>30, 31</sup> The primary concern for both types of ECG screening is the harm of subsequent procedures or interventions initiated as a result of screening (eg, angiography or revascularization procedures). Only 1 study reported harms of subsequent testing (1/12 patients referred for revascularization had a nonfatal myocardial infarction);<sup>2</sup> therefore, the USPSTF included a broader range of study designs in its evaluation to estimate potential harms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Angiography rates after screening with exercise ECG in asymptomatic populations are generally less than 3% (range, 0.6% to 13%). The majority of patients undergoing angiography in these studies did not have angiographically demonstrable coronary artery stenosis, but some did undergo revascularization (0.1% to 0.5%).<sup>18</sup> Based on large population-based registries that include symptomatic persons, angiography is associated with a serious harm rate of 1.7%, including arrhythmia (0.40%), death (0.10%), stroke (0.07%), and myocardial infarction (0.05%). Revascularization increases the risk of periprocedural myocardial infarction (1.7%), coronary artery dissection (1.3%), bleeding events within 72 hours (1.3%), vascular complications (0.4%), renal failure (0.4%), stroke (0.1%), and death on day of procedure (&lt;0.01%).<sup>18</sup> The USPSTF did not find any recent studies that directly address the potential harms of anxiety or labeling.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>For asymptomatic adults at low risk of CVD events (defined as 10-year CVD event risk &lt;10%), it is very unlikely that the information from resting or exercise ECG (beyond that obtained with conventional CVD risk factors) will result in a change in the patient&#39;s risk category that would lead to a change in treatment and ultimately improve health outcomes. Serious possible harms are associated with screening with resting or exercise ECG, specifically the potential adverse effects of subsequent invasive testing. Therefore, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening with ECG in asymptomatic adults at low risk of CVD events has no net benefit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For asymptomatic adults at intermediate or high risk of CVD events (defined as a 10-year CVD event risk of 10% to 20% or &gt;20%, respectively), there is insufficient evidence to determine the extent to which information from resting or exercise ECG adds to current CVD risk assessment models (ie, Pooled Cohort Equations) and whether it results in a change in risk management and ultimately reduces CVD events. As with low-risk adults, serious possible harms are associated with screening with resting or exercise ECG in asymptomatic adults at intermediate or high risk of CVD events. The USPSTF concludes that there is insufficient evidence to estimate the net benefit of screening with ECG in asymptomatic adults at intermediate or high risk of CVD events.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There is substantial and consistent evidence that identifying and treating traditional, modifiable CVD risk factors such as high blood pressure, abnormal lipid levels, diabetes, current smoking, physical inactivity, and diet improve cardiovascular outcomes. These risk factors are linked to the biological understanding of the pathophysiology of CVD. Electrocardiography measures the electrical activity in the heart and results can be abnormal for many reasons, only some of which are attributable to atherosclerotic CVD. In low-risk patients, these abnormalities are unlikely to result from atherosclerotic CVD; in intermediate- and high-risk patients, they are more likely to result from atherosclerotic CVD, but there is no evidence that targeting these abnormalities in addition to modifiable risk factors has benefit.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from December 19, 2017, to January 22, 2018.

In addition, social factors such as low socioeconomic status, lack of social or financial support, and adolescent parenthood have also been shown to increase the risk of developing perinatal depression. However, there is no accurate screening tool for identifying women at risk of perinatal depression and who might benefit from preventive interventions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A pragmatic approach, based on the populations included in the systematic evidence review, would be to provide counseling interventions to women with 1 or more of the following: a history of depression, current depressive symptoms (that do not reach a diagnostic threshold), certain socioeconomic risk factors such as low income or adolescent or single parenthood, recent intimate partner violence, or mental health&ndash;related factors such as elevated anxiety symptoms or a history of significant negative life events.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Counseling Interventions</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Studies on counseling interventions to prevent perinatal depression mainly included cognitive behavioral therapy and interpersonal therapy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cognitive behavioral therapy focuses on the concept that positive changes in mood and behavior can be achieved by addressing and managing negative thoughts, beliefs, and attitudes and by increasing positive events and activities.<sup>2,3</sup> Common therapeutic techniques include patient education, goal-setting, interventions to identify and modify maladaptive thought patterns, and behavioral activation. Interpersonal therapy focuses on treating interpersonal issues thought to contribute to the development or maintenance of psychological disorders.<sup>4</sup> Common therapeutic techniques include the use of exploratory questions (ie, open-ended and clarifying questions), role-playing, decision analysis, and communication analysis.<sup>2,5</sup> The interventions reviewed by the USPSTF varied in setting, intensity, format, and intervention staff. Counseling intervention trials included a mixture of populations at increased risk of perinatal depression and not at increased risk.<sup>2</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found limited or mixed evidence that other studied interventions such as physical activity, education, pharmacotherapy, dietary supplements, and health system interventions were effective in preventing perinatal depression.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Implementation</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There are no data on the ideal timing for offering or referral to counseling interventions; however, most were initiated during the second trimester of pregnancy.

The program included modules on the cognitive behavioral theory of mood and health; physiological effects of stress; the importance of pleasant and rewarding activities; how to reduce cognitive distortions and automatic thoughts; and the importance of social networks, positive mother-child attachment, and parenting strategies to promote child development and secure attachment in infants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Reach Out, Stand Strong, Essentials for New Mothers (ROSE) program is an example of an interpersonal therapy approach reviewed by the USPSTF.<sup>4,5,11-13</sup> It involved 4 or 5 prenatal group sessions lasting 60 to 90 minutes and 1 individual 50-minute postpartum session. Course content included psychoeducation on the &ldquo;baby blues&rdquo; and postpartum depression, stress management, development of a social support system, identification of role transitions, discussion of types of interpersonal conflicts common around childbirth and techniques for resolving them, and role-playing exercises with feedback from other group members.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Additional Approaches to Prevention of Depression</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration&mdash;Health Resources and Services Administration Center for Integrated Health Solutions promotes the development of, and provides resources for, integrating primary and behavioral health services.<sup>14</sup> The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration provides resources for locating mental health services.<sup>15</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Mothers and Babies program, which is based on cognitive behavioral therapy, also provides web-based resources for families and clinicians.<sup>16</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF has a related recommendation on screening for depression in adults, including pregnant and postpartum women (B recommendation).<sup>17</sup> The USPSTF also recommends screening for depression in adolescents aged 12 to 18 years (B recommendation) and found insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening in children 11 years or younger (I statement).<sup>18</sup></p><h2>Other Considerations</h2><h3 align=\"left\">Research Gaps and Needs</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Further research could address important gaps in several areas.

Additional risk factors include adolescent parenthood, low socioeconomic status, and lack of social support.<sup>37</sup> Genetic factors are also suspected to contribute to women&rsquo;s risk of developing perinatal depression.<sup>38</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Scope of Review</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF commissioned a systematic evidence review<sup>2,6</sup> to evaluate the evidence on the potential benefits and harms of preventive interventions for perinatal depression in pregnant or postpartum women or their children. The review focused on studies of interventions involving pregnant women and new mothers of any age who were both selected and unselected based on known risk factors. The review included studies of women with mental health symptoms or disorders, although studies targeting women with a depression diagnosis, women with high levels of depressive symptoms, or women currently being treated for a depressive disorder were excluded, as were studies of women with psychotic or developmental disorders. The USPSTF reviewed contextual information on the accuracy of tools used to identify women at increased risk of perinatal depression and the most effective timing for preventive interventions. Interventions reviewed included counseling, health system interventions, physical activity, education, supportive interventions, and other behavioral interventions, such as infant sleep training and expressive writing. Pharmacological approaches included the use of nortriptyline, sertraline, and omega-3 fatty acids.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Effectiveness of Preventive Interventions</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed studies of pregnant and postpartum women who received interventions to prevent perinatal depression delivered in or referred from primary care. The main reported outcomes were depression status (measured as cumulative incidence, point prevalence, or scoring above a cutoff on a symptom severity scale) and continuous depression symptom scale scores. Other health outcomes such as quality of life, infant or child outcomes, and functioning were also reported by trials and considered by the USPSTF. The USPSTF reviewed a total of 50 good- or fair-quality studies (49 randomized clinical trials, 1 nonrandomized controlled intervention study). The studies were divided between those that targeted pregnant (26/50 [52%]) or postpartum (22/50 [44%]) women. Two trials recruited pregnant women as well as women up to 26 weeks postpartum.<sup>2</sup> Most studies (42/50 [84%]) were limited to women 18 years or older, and the mean age across studies was 28.6 years. Twenty-six of the studies (52%) selected women with risk factors for perinatal depression. These included a personal or family history of depression (or perinatal depression), elevated depressive symptoms, socioeconomic factors (eg, low income, single or without partner, young age, or recent intimate partner violence), and other mental health factors (elevated anxiety symptoms or history of significant negative life events).<sup>2</sup> The majority of participants in the included studies were non-Hispanic white women, although 2 studies were limited to Latina women and 8 had a majority black and Latina population. Nearly one-fourth of the included studies (13/50 [26%]) were primarily or entirely composed of economically disadvantaged women.<sup>2</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Twenty trials (n = 4107) reported on counseling interventions. More than half were conducted in the United States (12/20 [60%]), most were limited to adults (older than 18 years) (17/20 [85%]), and most initiated interventions during pregnancy (17/20 [85%]).<sup>2</sup> Three-quarters of the trials were limited to women known to be at increased risk of perinatal depression because of depression history or symptoms (6/20 [30%]); non&ndash;depression-related risk factors such as low socioeconomic status, recent intimate partner violence, or young age (3/20 [15%]); or depression-related or other risk factors (6/20 [30%]). Almost two-thirds (13/20 [65%]) of the trials excluded women who met diagnostic criteria for current major depression or scored above the cutoff on a symptom severity scale. Most of the interventions (13/20 [65%]) used cognitive behavioral therapy or interpersonal therapy approaches. Counseling interventions lasted a median of 8 weeks and had a median of 12 hours of total contact time.<sup>2</sup> The interventions consisted of both group (15/20 [75%]) and individual (11/20 [55%]) sessions, with some involving both types.<sup>2</sup> Settings included in-person (19/20) or telephone-based meetings (2/20), and 4 trials included home visits. Across all counseling interventions, half to three-quarters of sessions were attended by participants.<sup>2</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the outcomes of incidence, prevalence, and scoring above the cutoff on a symptom severity scale were combined, counseling interventions were associated with a 39% reduction in the likelihood of perinatal depression (pooled relative risk [RR], 0.61 [95% CI, 0.47 to 0.78]).<sup>2</sup> Assuming a 19% baseline risk of perinatal depression (ie, the median percentage of women with depression in control groups at 3 to 6 months postpartum across all included studies), this corresponds to a number needed to treat of 13.5 women (95% CI, 9.9 to 23.9). Compared with the overall effect of counseling interventions, studies reporting the use of cognitive behavioral therapy or interpersonal therapy approaches showed similar effects.<sup>2</sup> Subgroup analysis of trials using the &ldquo;Mothers and Babies&rdquo; and ROSE programs showed pooled RR reductions of 53% and 50%, respectively.<sup>2</sup> When analyzing the effect of counseling interventions by study population, trials that selected women at increased risk of perinatal depression (based on symptoms, history of depression, or social or socioeconomic risk factors) demonstrated a larger positive effect compared with trials enrolling lower-risk, unselected populations (45% vs 21% risk reduction, respectively), although this difference was not statistically significant.<sup>2</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thirteen trials reported continuous symptom score measures, with 5 trials demonstrating statistically significant group differences.<sup>7,8,11,39,40</sup> Counseling interventions were associated with a small beneficial effect in symptom scores, resulting in a pooled standardized effect size of 0.2, or an average 1.5-point greater reduction in depression symptom severity compared with control groups.<sup>2</sup> Trials reported other maternal or child outcomes; however, outcome measures widely varied and there was little consistency across studies. Stress (4 trials)<sup>39,41-43</sup> and anxiety (4 trials)<sup>41,42,44,45</sup> were the most common other reported outcomes, although most trials did not demonstrate statistically significant findings.<sup>2</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Three studies (n = 5321)<sup>46-48</sup> examined health system&ndash;level interventions consisting of screening, counseling, and patient navigation services conducted by midwives and nurses.<sup>2</sup> In all 3 studies, usual care included home visitation.<sup>2</sup> Individually, each study showed a statistically significant risk reduction in the likelihood of scoring above the cutoff on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) (RR range, 0.33-0.71). However, pooled analysis did not demonstrate statistical significance (RR, 0.58 [95% CI, 0.22 to 1.53]). Three trials (n = 1200)<sup>49-51</sup> examined physical activity programs consisting of group or individual exercise sessions (with or without dietary advice or educational sessions). Two trials<sup>50,51</sup> found statistically significant reductions in depression symptoms (weighted mean difference, &minus;3.45 [95% CI, &minus;4.99 to &minus;1.91]),<sup>2</sup> although pooled analysis failed to demonstrate statistically significant reductions in depression diagnosis (RR, 0.54 [95% CI, 0.18 to 1.57]).<sup>2</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Three trials (n = 980) focusing on improving infant sleep demonstrated mixed results. One trial found a 39% reduction in the likelihood of scoring 10 or higher on the EPDS at 6-month follow-up (adjusted odds ratio, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.34 to 0.94]).<sup>52</sup> Two other trials reported statistically significant or near-significant reductions in symptom severity scores at 1 (but not all) of several time points on at least 1 depression screening instrument (but not all).<sup>53,54</sup> Educational interventions and other supportive interventions, such as telephone-based peer support and nondirective group sessions, demonstrated inconsistent findings, with 1 of 6 and 3 of 7 trials, respectively, reporting statistically significant reductions in depression status or depression symptom scores. Yoga classes, debriefing exercises, and expressive writing failed to demonstrate statistically significant reductions in depression symptoms or status.<sup>2</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Four trials of chemoprevention of perinatal depression assessed the effects of sertraline (n = 22),<sup>55</sup> nortriptyline (n = 58),<sup>56</sup> and omega-3 fatty acids (n = 219).<sup>57,58</sup> The sertraline trial found that at 20 weeks postpartum, women taking sertraline had decreased depression recurrence compared with those taking placebo (7% vs 50%, respectively; <em>P</em> = 0.04). In addition, the time to depression recurrence was faster in participants receiving placebo (<em>P</em> = 0.02).<sup>55</sup> Neither nortriptyline<sup>56</sup> nor omega-3 fatty acids<sup>57,58</sup> showed preventive benefits for perinatal depression compared with placebo, although omega-3 fatty acids demonstrated small statistically significant improvements in gestational length, mean birth weight, and 5-minute Apgar score.<sup>58</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Potential Harms of Preventive Interventions</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The nortriptyline trial<sup>56</sup> reported only the number of events for 1 of 11 adverse effects, with 78% of women taking nortriptyline reporting constipation (vs 22% of women taking placebo). Participants taking sertraline were more likely than those taking placebo to report dizziness (57% vs 13%, respectively; <em>P</em> = 0.05) and drowsiness (100% vs 50%, respectively; <em>P</em> = 0.02).<sup>55</sup> One woman taking nortriptyline and 1 woman taking sertraline developed mania or hypomania, but there were no cases among women taking placebo.<sup>55,56</sup> No harms were associated with omega-3 fatty acids. None of the other included intervention trials reported harms outcomes.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found convincing evidence that counseling interventions, such as cognitive behavioral therapy and interpersonal therapy, are effective in preventing perinatal depression. Based on the population of women included in the studies, those with a history of depression, current depressive symptoms, or certain socioeconomic risk factors (eg, low income or young or single parenthood) would benefit from counseling interventions and could be considered at increased risk. The USPSTF found adequate evidence to bound the potential harms of counseling interventions as no greater than small, based on the nature of the intervention and the low likelihood of serious harms. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to assess the benefits and harms of other noncounseling interventions. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that providing or referring pregnant or postpartum women at increased risk to counseling interventions has a moderate net benefit in preventing perinatal depression.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from August 28 to September 24, 2018. Several comments requested that the recommendation be expanded to include associated mood disorders (such as anxiety disorder). The primary focus of the USPSTF recommendation and evidence review was depression. Several additional outcomes (including anxiety) were included in the scope of the evidence review; however, reporting on incidence or symptoms of anxiety was limited and inconsistent. Several comments questioned why perinatal depression screening tools such as the EPDS were not recommended as risk-assessment tools. Additionally, comments requested that the USPSTF clarify the population at risk that would benefit from counseling interventions. The focus of this recommendation is the prevention of depression; the USPSTF has a separate recommendation on screening for depression in all adults, including pregnant women. The Research Gaps and Needs section calls for more studies on the use of tools for risk assessment, including established screening tools. For this recommendation, the USPSTF defined increased risk based on the study population; the USPSTF made revisions to further identify who would be considered at increased risk of depression. Several comments raised concerns about the ability of clinicians to implement the recommendation because of barriers to accessing mental health services. The USPSTF recognizes these barriers and provided some additional information about mental health resources and systems to connect patients to appropriate care in the Implementation section and Additional Approaches to Prevention of Depression section.</p>","topic":"Perinatal Depression: Preventive Interventions","keywords":"depression|postpartum depression|pregnancy depression|perinatal depression|PPD","pubDate":"2019-02-12","categories":["8","9","2"],"tool":["194","196","195"]},"408":{"topicType":"Screening","topicYear":2020,"uspstfAlias":"drug-use-illicit-screening","specific":[767,768],"title":"Unhealthy Drug Use: Screening","rationale":"<h2>Importance</h2><p>Many people in the US experience problems related to unhealthy drug use, defined in this recommendation statement as the use of illegal drugs and the nonmedical use of prescription psychoactive medications (ie, use of medications for reasons, for duration, in amounts, or with frequency other than prescribed or use by persons other than the prescribed individual). In 2018, an estimated 12% of US residents 18 years or older reported current unhealthy drug use in a national survey.<sup>1</sup> Unhealthy drug use is more commonly reported by young adults aged 18 to 25 years (24%) than by older adults (10%) or adolescents aged 12 to 17 years (8%). In 2018, an estimated 5.4% of pregnant persons aged 15 to 44 years reported unhealthy drug use in the last month. Adults 18 years or older (10.5%) and adolescents aged 12 to 17 years (8.0%) more commonly reported cannabis use in the last month than nonmedical use of psychotherapeutic medications, including pain relievers (2.1% and 1.3%, respectively) and opioids (1.2% and 0.7%, respectively).<sup>1</sup> In both age groups, less than 1% reported use of heroin, cocaine, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamines in the last month.</p>\r\n<p>An estimated 8 million persons 12 years or older met diagnostic criteria for drug dependence or abuse of drugs in the past year.<sup>1</sup> Drug use is one of the most common causes of preventable death, injuries, and disability.<sup>2,3</sup> In 2017, unhealthy drug use caused more than 70,000 fatal overdoses.<sup>4</sup> Drug use can cause many serious health effects that vary by drug type, administration mode, amount, and frequency of use, as well as pregnancy status.<sup>5</sup> Opioid use can cause drowsiness, slowed breathing, constipation, coma, and fatal overdose. Stimulants such as cocaine can cause arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, seizures, and other complications. Marijuana use is associated with slowed reaction time; problems with balance, coordination, learning, and memory; and chronic cough and frequent respiratory infections.<sup>5</sup> Injection drug use may result in blood-borne viral and bacterial infections.<sup>2,5</sup> Drug use during pregnancy can increase risk of obstetric complications such as placental abruption, preeclampsia, and third trimester bleeding, as well as adverse fetal and infant outcomes such as spontaneous abortion, abnormal brain growth, preterm delivery, low birth weight, and neonatal abstinence syndrome.<sup>6</sup> Drug use is also associated with violence, criminal activity, incarceration, impaired school and work performance, interpersonal dysfunction, and other social and legal problems.<sup>7</sup></p><h2>USPSTF Assessment of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h2><h4>Adults 18 Years or Older</h4>\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening by asking questions about unhealthy drug use in adults has <strong>moderate net benefit</strong> when services for accurate diagnosis of unhealthy drug use or drug use disorders, effective treatment, and appropriate care can be offered or referred.</p>\r\n<h4>Adolescents Aged 12 to 17 Years</h4>\r\n<p>Because of the lack of evidence, the USPSTF concludes that the benefits and harms of screening for any type of unhealthy drug use in adolescents are uncertain and that the <strong>balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>See the <a href=\"#tab\">Table </a>for more information on the USPSTF recommendation rationale and assessment.

This statement does not apply to adolescents or adults who have a currently diagnosed drug use disorder or are currently undergoing or have been referred for drug use treatment. This statement applies to settings and populations for which services for accurate diagnosis, effective treatment, and appropriate care can be offered or referred. The net benefit assessment does not apply to settings and populations for which treatment cannot be provided or the result of screening is punitive.</p>\r\n<h3>Definitions</h3>\r\n<p>For the purposes of this recommendation, &ldquo;unhealthy drug use&rdquo; is defined as the use of substances (not including alcohol or tobacco products) that are illegally obtained or the nonmedical use of prescription psychoactive medications; that is, use of medications for reasons, for duration, in amounts, or with frequency other than prescribed or by persons other than the prescribed individual. These substances are ingested, inhaled, injected, or administered using other methods to affect cognition, affect, or other mental processes; to &ldquo;get high&rdquo;; or for other nonmedical reasons. Unhealthy drug use is abbreviated as &ldquo;drug use&rdquo; in this recommendation statement.</p>\r\n<p>Screening refers to asking 1 or more questions about drug use or drug-related risks in face-to-face, print, or audiovisual format. It does not refer to testing urine, saliva, blood, or other biological specimens for the presence of drugs.</p>\r\n<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF recommends screening by asking questions in all adults 18 years or older regardless of risk factors for unhealthy drug use. However, some factors are associated with a higher prevalence of unhealthy drug use. These include being aged 18 to 25 years; male sex; having a mental health condition, personality or mood disorder, or nicotine or alcohol dependence; a history of physical or sexual abuse, parental neglect, or other adversity in childhood; or drug or alcohol addiction in a first-degree relative.<sup>1,9</sup> Factors associated with misuse of prescription drugs include history of other drug use, mental illness, pain, and greater access to prescription drugs.<sup>10</sup> Factors associated with prenatal use of drugs include a mental health disorder, interpersonal violence, and family history of substance use.<sup>11</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Screening Tools</h3>\r\n<p>Several screening tools that ask questions about drug use are available for identifying 1 or more classes of unhealthy drug use, the frequency or severity of use, or drug-related health, social, or legal consequences that characterize unhealthy use or drug use disorders. Interviewer-administered tools and self-administered tools appear to have similar accuracy.<sup>12</sup></p>\r\n<p>Primary care practices may consider several factors when selecting screening tools. Brief tools (eg, NIDA [National Institute on Drug Abuse] Quick Screen, which asks 4 questions about use of alcohol, tobacco, nonmedical use of prescription drugs, and illegal drugs in the past year) may be more feasible in busy primary care settings, but longer tools (eg, the 8-item ASSIST [Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test]) that assess risks associated with unhealthy drug use or comorbid conditions may reveal information signaling the need for prompt diagnostic assessment. Tools with questions about nonmedical use of prescription drugs (eg, TAPS [Tobacco, Alcohol, Prescription Medication, and Other Substance Use]) may be useful when clinicians are concerned about prescription misuse. One study reported that drug use questions in the PRO (Prenatal Risk Overview) risk assessment tool were reasonably accurate for identifying drug abuse or dependence in pregnant women.</p>\r\n<p>Screening tools are not meant to diagnose drug dependence, abuse, addiction, or drug use disorders. Patients with positive screening results may, therefore, need to be offered or referred for diagnostic assessment.</p>\r\n<h3>Screening Intervals</h3>\r\n<p>There is little evidence about the optimal time to start asking about unhealthy drug use or the optimal interval for screening in adults older than 18 years.</p>\r\n<h3>Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>Treatment of drug use disorders is based on the type of drug used, the severity of drug use, and the type of use disorder. Many drug use disorders are chronic, relapsing conditions, and many persons who start treatment do not complete treatment.<sup>13</sup> Therefore, treatment must often be repeated to stabilize current drug use, reduce relapse, and achieve abstinence or other treatment goals. Some patients, such as those who are pregnant, nursing, or caring for ill or healthy neonates, may require specialized treatment settings.</p>\r\n<p>Pharmacotherapy, which is often provided with individual or group counseling, is the standard for treatment of opioid use disorders involving heroin or prescription opioid use in adults and pregnant and postpartum persons.<sup>14-16</sup> Drug use disorders involving nonopioid drugs, such as cannabis, stimulants, and some prescription drugs, are generally treated with various psychosocial interventions that usually involve multiple sessions of cognitive behavioral therapy, motivational interventions, contingency management, relapse prevention, community reinforcement, family behavioral therapy, 12-step facilitation therapy, or other behavioral approaches. Intensive interventions usually involve several in-person sessions over several weeks or months.</p>\r\n<p>The management of patients who screen positive is usually accompanied by other interventions, including testing for blood-borne pathogens; assessment of misuse of, abuse of, or dependence on alcohol or tobacco; assessment of potentially coexisting mental health disorders; and pain management for patients with pain who are abusing opioids.</p>\r\n<h3>Implementation</h3>\r\n<p>In practice, the benefits and harms of screening may vary because of several health, social, and legal issues. In many communities, affordable, accessible, and timely services for diagnostic assessment and treatment of patients with positive screening results are in limited supply or unaffordable.</p>\r\n<p>To minimize the potential adverse effects such as stigma, labeling, or medicolegal consequences of asking questions about drug use and documenting and reporting answers, clinicians should be aware of state requirements and best practices on informed consent for screening, mandatory screening, documenting screening results in medical records, reporting of screening results to medicolegal authorities, and confidentiality protections (see the Additional Tools and Resources section).<sup>17-24</sup> This recommendation statement applies to settings and populations for which services for accurate diagnosis, effective treatment, and appropriate care can be offered or referred. The net benefit assessment does not apply to settings and populations for which treatment is not provided or the result of screening is punitive.</p>\r\n<h3>Additional Tools and Resources</h3>\r\n<p>Several tools may help clinicians implement this screening recommendation (<a href=\"#box\">Box</a>).</p>\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement for Adolescents Aged 12 to 17 Years</h3>\r\n<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>\r\n<p>Based on a national survey in 2018, 8% of adolescents aged 12 to 17 years reported drug use in the last month. Among youth reporting such drug use, the most commonly used substances were marijuana, inhalants, prescription psychotherapeutic drugs, opioids, and hallucinogens.<sup>1</sup> An estimated 2.7% met diagnostic criteria for drug dependence or abuse,<sup>1</sup> and the vast majority presented with concurrent mental health diagnoses.<sup>25</sup> Risk factors for drug use in youth include aggressive childhood behavior, lack of parental supervision, poor social skills, access to drugs at school, and community poverty.<sup>26</sup></p>\r\n<p>Adolescent substance use, including use of heroin and misuse of prescription opioids, is associated with the leading causes of death&mdash;suicide, overdose, unintentional injury, and violence in adolescents and young adulthood.<sup>25</sup> Substance use during this period of rapid brain development can also harm neurocognitive development and endocrine function that, in turn, can impair academic, occupational, and social functioning.<sup>26-28</sup> Adolescents with drug use disorders are also at increased risk of sexually transmitted infections, other physical health problems, unintended pregnancies, criminal involvement, and school truancy.<sup>25</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment</h4>\r\n<p>Although there is limited evidence on harms, adolescents may experience potential harms from screening for drug use such as labeling and stigmatization. Because of concerns about long-term use of opioid agonists, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) restricts approval for buprenorphine to youth 16 years or older, and the US Department of Health and Human Services restricts admission to methadone programs to youth younger than 18 years who continue to use opioids after at least 2 rounds of detoxification and psychosocial interventions.<sup>28</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Current Practice</h4>\r\n<p>About 50% to 86% of pediatricians report routinely screening for substance use, and most screen using their clinical impressions rather than a validated screening tool.<sup>22</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Other Related USPSTF Recommendations</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF has issued recommendation statements on these related topics:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Interventions to prevent drug use in children, adolescents, and young adults<sup>29</sup></li>\r\n<li>Screening and behavioral counseling interventions for reducing unhealthy alcohol use in adolescents and adults<sup>30</sup></li>\r\n<li>Interventions for tobacco smoking cessation in adults, including pregnant women<sup>31</sup></li>\r\n<li>Primary care interventions to prevent tobacco use in children and adolescents<sup>32</sup></li>\r\n<li>Screening for depression in adults<sup>33</sup></li>\r\n<li>Screening for depression in children and adolescents<sup>34</sup></li>\r\n<li>Screening<sup>35</sup></li>\r\n</ul><h2>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h2><p>This recommendation statement replaces the 2008 USPSTF recommendation, which concluded that the evidence at that time was insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for illicit drug use in adolescents and adults, including those who were pregnant or postpartum.<sup>36</sup> This updated statement incorporates new evidence since 2008 about the accuracy of screening tools and the benefits and harms of treatment of unhealthy drug use or drug use disorders. This new evidence supports the current recommendation that primary care clinicians offer screening to adults 18 years or older, including those who are pregnant or postpartum, when services for accurate diagnosis, effective treatment, and appropriate care can be offered or referred. The USPSTF continues to conclude that the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for drug use in adolescents.</p><h2>Box.

These reviews evaluated evidence on the benefits and harms of screening for drug use, accuracy of screening tools to detect drug use, and the benefits and harms of psychosocial interventions and pharmacotherapy.<sup>12,37,38</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening Tools</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF identified 30 different screening tools that were evaluated in adults, pregnant or postpartum persons, or adolescents. Many tools had sensitivity of 75% or more for detecting unhealthy drug use, drug abuse or dependence, or drug use disorders. Most screening studies used structured clinical or diagnostic interviews that used varying definitions of drug use, abuse, dependence, and drug use disorders as the reference standard. Few studies used biologic reference standards such as testing of hair or urine specimens.<sup>12,37</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Adults</h4>\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed 12 studies that assessed the accuracy of 15 different screening tools in nonpregnant adults.<sup>12,37</sup> There was considerable variation in sample size (139 to 2057, not including a large US-based national sample of 42,923), proportion of female participants (4.7% to 94%), and mean age (25.2 to 62.6 years). All but 2 studies were conducted in the US. The use and severity of use of any drug or specific drugs varied widely across study populations. The prevalence of unhealthy use of any drug ranged from 14.2% to 37.9% and the prevalence of use disorders due to any drug ranged from 1.8% to 16.7%, based on reference standards of clinical interviews (with or without confirmation of drug use by saliva testing).</p>\r\n<p>Several screening tools directly addressed the frequency of drug use (single-item drug frequency; SUBS [Substance Use Brief Screen]; and TAPS-1) or the frequency of drug use and risks associated with drug use (ASSIST; ASSIST-Drug; CAST [Cannabis Abuse Screening Test]; 2-, 10-, and 28-DAST [Drug-Abuse Screening Test]; PDUQp [Prescription Drug Use Questionnaire-Patient Version]; PSQ [Parent Screening Questionnaire]; SoDU [Screen of Drug Use]; TAPS; and TICS [Two-Item Conjoint Screen], all of which are examples of &ldquo;direct tools&rdquo;). One tool indirectly assessed drug use by asking questions about alcohol or tobacco use (single-item heavy episode drinking frequency [an example of an &ldquo;indirect tool&rdquo;]).<sup>12</sup></p>\r\n<p>The sensitivity of direct tools for detecting unhealthy use of &ldquo;any drug&rdquo; (including illegal drugs and nonmedical use of prescription drugs) in the past month or year ranged from 0.71 to 0.94 (95% CI, 0.62-0.97), and specificity ranged from 0.87 to 0.97 (95% CI, 0.83-0.98). Direct tool sensitivity for detecting abuse or dependence or a use disorder related to &ldquo;any drug&rdquo; ranged from 0.85 to 1.00 (95% CI, 0.75-1.00) and specificity ranged from 0.67 to 0.93 (95% CI, 0.58-0.95). Screening tools had higher sensitivity for detecting unhealthy drug use and drug use disorders related to &ldquo;any drug&rdquo; (most of which was cannabis), cannabis, heroin, and stimulants than for detecting unhealthy drug use or drug use disorders related to nonmedical use of prescription drugs, including opioids or sedatives (range, 0.38-0.96 [95% CI, 0.29-0.99]) but specificity was comparable (range, 0.79-1.00 [95% CI, 0.71-1.00]).<sup>12</sup></p>\r\n<p>Four studies assessed the accuracy of direct tools (the frequency-based ASSIST-2 tool and the risk assessment&ndash;based DAST-10, PRO, and WIDUS [Wayne Indirect Drug Use Screener]/ASSIST-2 [modified tool]) or an indirect tool (WIDUS) for detecting drug use or drug use disorders (not including alcohol) in women recruited during prenatal care visits or shortly after delivery. The prevalence of any prenatal drug use varied from 1.2% to 41% across these 4 studies. Sensitivity for detecting any prenatal use of drugs using direct tools ranged from 0.37 to 0.76 (95% CI, 0.24-0.86) and specificity ranged from 0.68 to 0.83 (95% CI, 0.55-0.91). One study of the PRO risk assessment&ndash;based tool (in a population in which 7% met diagnostic criteria for drug abuse, dependence, or both) reported sensitivity for detecting any drug abuse or dependence of 0.89 (95% CI, 0.77-0.95) and specificity of 0.74 (95% CI, 0.71-0.77). The only indirect tool that reported on any prenatal use of drugs, not including alcohol (WIDUS/ASSIST-2), had lower sensitivity (0.68 [95% CI, 0.53-0.80]) and specificity (0.69 [95% CI, 0.57-0.80]). An additional study of the indirect tool Parents Partner Past Pregnancy reported high sensitivity (0.87 [95% CI, 0.71-0.95) and high specificity (0.76 [95% CI, 0.70-0.82]) for detecting the combined outcome of any prenatal use of drugs or alcohol but did not assess the outcome of prenatal use of drugs alone.<sup>12</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Adolescents</h4>\r\n<p>The evidence on accuracy of screening tools in adolescents is limited. Most studies focus on the detection of cannabis use; no studies provide information specifically on opioid use or other drug classes. Few tools that assess cannabis use were evaluated in more than 1 study. The available studies evaluated direct tools&mdash;the Brief Screener for Tobacco, Alcohol, and Other Drugs; a single item assessing cannabis use; ASSIST; ASSIST-Lite; CAST; CPQ-A-S (Cannabis Problems Questionnaire for Adolescents-Shortened); CRAFFT (Car Relax Alone Forget Family/Friends Trouble); PESQ-PS (Personal Experience Screening Questionnaire-Problem Severity Scale); POSIT (Problem Oriented Screening Instrument for Teenagers); and SDS (Severity Dependence Scale)&mdash;against a diagnostic interview. Sensitivity of these direct tools for detecting any cannabis use or unhealthy use ranged from 0.68 to 0.98 (95% CI, 0.64-0.99) and specificity ranged from 0.82 to 1.00 (95% CI, 0.80-1.00). Sensitivity of these direct tools for detecting cannabis use disorders ranged from 0.71 to 0.98 (95% CI, 0.41-1.00) and specificity ranged from 0.79 to 0.95 (95% CI, 0.77-0.98). Given the limited number of studies on individual tools and the lack of information on the accuracy of tools for detecting use of drugs other than cannabis, the USPSTF determined the evidence on accuracy of screening in adolescents to be inadequate.<sup>12</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Screening and Treatment</h3>\r\n<h4>Screening</h4>\r\n<p>No studies directly addressed the benefits of screening on reducing drug use or drug-related health, social, or legal outcomes in adults or adolescents.</p>\r\n<h4>Pharmacotherapy</h4>\r\n<p>Several trials found that use of FDA-approved pharmacotherapy had benefits for nonpregnant adults with opioid use disorders who had sought or were referred for treatment for symptoms, signs, or drug-related health, social, or legal problems (hereafter abbreviated as &ldquo;treatment-seeking populations&rdquo;). Adults assigned to pharmacotherapy generally had lower rates of relapse and increased retention in treatment than adults assigned to placebo or no treatment.<sup>37,38</sup></p>\r\n<p>Nineteen trials evaluated naltrexone (opioid antagonist), buprenorphine (partial opioid agonist), or methadone (opioid agonist) (usually provided with individual or group counseling) in adults with opioid use disorder primarily related to heroin. None assessed the effects of pharmacotherapy in adults whose opioid use disorder was related only to prescription opioids or was detected through primary care screening. Trials recruited participants from inpatient settings, drug treatment programs, and criminal justice systems. Most trials were conducted outside the US, and several used naltrexone formulations not available in the US. Most participants were adult males younger than 30 years. No trials specifically enrolled pregnant or postpartum persons or adolescents, although FDA-approved pharmacotherapy agents are available for these patient populations. However, women of reproductive age comprised 25% to 46% of trial participants who received methadone or buprenorphine and 0% to 28% of participants who received naltrexone.<sup>37,38</sup></p>\r\n<p>Thirteen trials evaluated the effects of oral, injectable, or implantable naltrexone. Outcomes were assessed during the course of treatment in 11 trials (2-9 months after start of treatment) or after treatment completion in 2 trials (6-10 months after completion). Sample sizes ranged from 31 to 306 (total N = 1718 participants). Retention in treatment varied considerably in persons assigned to naltrexone (range, 7%-60%) and persons assigned to placebo or no treatment (range, 6%-56%). Use of naltrexone was associated with a significant decrease in drug use relapse (pooled relative risk [RR], 0.73 [95% CI, 0.62-0.85]) and increased retention in treatment (pooled RR, 1.71 [95% CI, 1.13-2.49]). The few naltrexone trials that reported on mortality, global functioning, quality of life, anxiety, depression, or legal or employment outcomes had inconsistent findings regarding these outcomes, but mortality was rare.<sup>37,38</sup></p>\r\n<p>Seven trials assessed the opioid agonist methadone, the partial opioid agonist buprenorphine, or both. During the course of ongoing treatment with 1 of these 2 opioid agonists (monitored for 4-12 months), use of methadone and sublingual or implantable buprenorphine was significantly associated with a decrease in relapse (4 trials; pooled RR, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.59-0.82]) and increased retention in treatment (7 trials; pooled RR, 2.58 [95% CI, 1.78-4.59]). Findings from 5 trials that assessed the effects of opioid agonists on health, social, and legal outcomes were mixed and did not show clear treatment benefits. A few trials found that buprenorphine was associated with better self-reported scores on quality of life, well-being, and life satisfaction. No deaths were reported in trials that reported this outcome.<sup>37,38</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Psychosocial Interventions&nbsp;</h4>\r\n<p><strong>Adults.</strong> Psychosocial interventions were associated with increased likelihood of abstaining from use of drugs vs control conditions at 3 to 4 months (15 trials; RR, 1.60 [95% CI, 1.24-2.13]) and at 6 to 12 months (14 trials; RR, 1.25 [95% CI, 1.11-1.52]).<sup>37,38</sup></p>\r\n<p>Approximately one-half of the psychosocial intervention trials enrolled persons who had sought or were referred for drug treatment. Sample sizes ranged from 34 to 1175 (total N = 15,659). Most trials were conducted in the US and included participants who were primarily male, nonwhite, and had lower socioeconomic status. The severity of drug use in trial participants varied greatly. Interventions were categorized as intensive (defined as more than 2 sessions or 2 sessions lasting more than 1 hour each) or brief (defined as 1 to 2 sessions each lasting 1 hour or less). Interventions were generally based on established behavioral approaches and were administered by telephone or in person by researchers or were self-administered by computer. Intensive interventions commonly used face-to-face cognitive behavioral therapy, motivational interviewing, and contingency management approaches. Most brief interventions consisted of a single, personalized counseling session with in-person or computer-based feedback, with or without a telephone or in-person booster session. Follow-up ranged from 3 to 4 months to 12 or more months after the start of interventions. Thirty-eight percent to 98% of participants completed assessments at designated follow-up points. Meta-analyses and sensitivity analyses included only the subset of trials with data that could be pooled and combined trials that evaluated nonpregnant adults, pregnant or postpartum adults, or adolescents; any type of drug use; and either brief or intensive interventions.<sup>38</sup></p>\r\n<p>In sensitivity analyses, effects on abstinence were greater at 3 to 4 months in trials of treatment-seeking populations (7 trials; RR, 2.08 [95% CI, 1.51-3.07]) than in trials of screen-detected populations (8 trials; RR, 1.28 [95% CI, 0.97-1.84]; <em>P</em> =0.05 for interaction). Effects on abstinence were smaller in trials of brief interventions than in trials of intensive interventions, but the differences were not statistically significant. Effects were statistically significant for abstinence from cannabis use (7 trials; RR, 2.08 [95% CI, 1.51-3.07] at 3 to 4 months and 4 trials; RR, 1.58 [95% CI, 1.17-3.06] at 6 to 12 months), but not for abstinence from stimulants or mixed drug use. Results of meta-analyses on the association of psychosocial interventions and other outcomes, including number of days using drugs and drug use severity, were mixed. Evidence on the association between psychosocial interventions and health, social, or legal outcomes related to use of cannabis, stimulants, opioids, &ldquo;any drug,&rdquo; or mixed drugs in adults was sparse and showed no or limited effectiveness.<sup>38</sup></p>\r\n<p>Five trials specifically assessed intensive or brief interventions exclusively in pregnant or postpartum persons compared with attention control groups or information and advice from obstetricians or nurses. None reported significant effects on drug use or health, social, or legal outcomes of drug use at 3 to 6 months after the start of the interventions.<sup>12</sup><em>&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n<p><strong>Adolescents.</strong> There were few trials on psychosocial interventions that focused on adolescents aged 12 to 17 years. Evidence was limited and results were inconclusive.<sup>12,38</sup> These studies did not report the effect of psychosocial interventions on drugs other than cannabis.</p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Screening and Treatment</h3>\r\n<h4>Screening</h4>\r\n<p>No studies addressed the harms of screening in adults or adolescents.<sup>12</sup><em>&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n<h4>Pharmacotherapy</h4>\r\n<p>Eleven naltrexone trials and 4 buprenorphine trials assessed potential harms, including suicide, overdose, or study withdrawal due to serious adverse events, but no methadone trials assessed harms. Few harms or serious adverse events were reported. In pooled analyses, the risk of adverse events was generally similar in persons assigned to pharmacotherapy and control groups, including the risk of study discontinuation due to adverse events (3 trials; RR, 1.54 [95% CI, 0.35-8.31]) or serious adverse events (3 trials; RR, 1.24 [95% CI, 0.11-10.21]) in trials of naltrexone or the risk of serious adverse events (2 trials; RR, 0.32 [95% CI, 0.09-1.12]) in trials of buprenorphine. Constipation was significantly more common in buprenorphine users than in control groups. No trials reported on harms of pharmacotherapy in adolescents or in pregnant or postpartum persons.<sup>38</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Psychosocial Interventions</h4>\r\n<p>None of the 4 trials that reported on harms or adverse events of brief psychosocial interventions identified harms or adverse events. These included 2 trials in college students targeting cannabis use and 2 trials in postpartum persons who received brief interventions after delivery. None of the other psychosocial intervention trials reported on harms or adverse events in adults.<sup>38</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from August 13 to September 9, 2019. In response to public comments, the USPSTF clarified that &ldquo;screening&rdquo; means asking questions about unhealthy drug use (not testing biological specimens, such as blood or urine testing) and that the term &ldquo;unhealthy drug use&rdquo; is used to describe nonmedical use of prescription or nonprescription drugs, illegal drugs, or unregulated substances (other than alcohol or tobacco). A few comments requested more information about the USPSTF&rsquo;s interpretation of the evidence. The USPSTF clarified in the Rationale section that screening in primary care settings for drug use can detect a spectrum of drug use and types of drug use. The USPSTF, therefore, considered evidence from treatment trials that may have included patients with more severe drug use disorders to be applicable to screening. Some comments noted that screening adults may have unintended harms, such as discouraging health care seeking in persons who do not want to be screened, medical and sociolegal consequences of reporting positive screening results, privacy issues, or diverting clinicians&rsquo; attention from patients with established drug use disorders. The USPSTF recognizes these as potential harms and provided more details on screening implementation considerations that may address these harms. In addition, the USPSTF clarified in the Practice Considerations section that the net benefit assessment for this recommendation does not apply to settings and populations for which treatment is not provided or the result of screening is punitive.</p>\r\n<p>Some respondents commented that screening should be offered to adolescents, but the USPSTF did not find sufficient evidence to support routine screening in this age group.</p><h2>Research Needs and Gaps</h2><p>The USPSTF identified important gaps related to screening for unhealthy drug use. To fill these gaps, the USPSTF needs more evidence from well-designed studies that further evaluate the following.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The effectiveness of screening and interventions for drug use in adolescents</li>\r\n<li>The optimal screening interval for detecting unhealthy drug use</li>\r\n<li>The accuracy of screening tools for detecting nonmedical use of prescription drugs, including opioids</li>\r\n<li>Strategies to improve access to pharmacotherapy and psychosocial interventions for persons with various types of drug use disorders</li>\r\n<li>The harms that occur when the result of screening is punitive</li>\r\n<li>The benefits and harms of providing prophylactic prescriptions for naloxone &ldquo;rescue therapy&rdquo; to patients in whom opioid misuse or opioid use disorders are detected after primary care screening</li>\r\n</ul><h2>Recommendations of Others</h2><p>Several organizations have issued statements about screening for drug use by asking about drug use; these recommendations vary by patient subpopulation. SAMHSA recommends universal screening for substance use (including alcohol), brief intervention, and/or referral to treatment (known as SBIRT) as part of routine health care,<sup>12</sup> including during pregnancy.<sup>17</sup> The US Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs<sup>39</sup> and the American Academy of Family Physicians<sup>40</sup> have adopted the 2008 USPSTF recommendation statement (I statement) indicating that evidence is insufficient to recommend routine screening for illicit drug use. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends screening adolescents through their early 20s for substance use (including tobacco and alcohol) at every annual physical examination as well as screening adolescents who present to emergency departments or urgent care centers; report cigarette smoking; have depression, anxiety, or other mental health conditions associated with substance abuse; or exhibit school, legal, or social problems or other behavioral changes.<sup>41</sup> It provides a list of screening tools that have been validated for use in adolescents through their early 20s.<sup>22</sup> The Bright Futures initiative includes a recommendation that all adolescents (including those aged 18 to 21 years) should be screened for substance use (including tobacco and alcohol) as part of an overall psychosocial history.<sup>42</sup> The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists specifically advises screening women annually for nonmedical use of prescription drugs. It also recommends screening women aged 18 to 26 years for drug use as part of preventive care, universal screening of women before pregnancy and early in pregnancy, and screening postpartum women as indicated.<sup>43-49</sup></p>","topic":"Unhealthy Drug Use: Screening","keywords":"Drug Use|illicit drug|prescription drug|unhealthy drug use","pubDate":"2020-06-09","categories":["1","8"],"tool":["204","206","205"]},"409":{"topicType":"Screening and Counseling","topicYear":2018,"uspstfAlias":"unhealthy-alcohol-use-in-adolescents-and-adults-screening-and-behavioral-counseling-interventions","specific":[438,439],"title":"Unhealthy Alcohol Use in Adolescents and Adults: Screening and Behavioral Counseling Interventions","rationale":"<h2>Rationale</h2><h3 align=\"left\">Importance</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF uses the term &ldquo;unhealthy alcohol use&rdquo; to define a spectrum of behaviors, from risky drinking to alcohol use disorder (AUD) (eg, harmful alcohol use, abuse, or dependence) (<a href=\"#tab\">Table</a>).<sup>1</sup> &ldquo;Risky&rdquo; or&rdquo; hazardous&rdquo; alcohol use means drinking more than the recommended daily, weekly, or per-occasion amounts, resulting in increased risk for health consequences but not meeting criteria for AUD.<sup>2</sup> The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) defines &ldquo;risky use&rdquo; as exceeding the recommended limits of 4 drinks per day (56 g/d based on the US standard of 14 g/drink) or 14 drinks per week (196 g/d) for healthy adult men aged 21 to 64 years or 3 drinks per day or 7 drinks per week (42 g/d or 98 g/week) for all adult women of any age and men 65 years or older.<sup>2</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A standard drink is defined as 12.0 oz of beer (5% alcohol), 5.0 oz of wine (12% alcohol), or 1.5 oz of liquor (40% alcohol).<sup>2</sup> The American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) defines &ldquo;hazardous use&rdquo; as alcohol use that increases the risk of future negative health consequences.<sup>3</sup> The <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition</em> (<em>DSM-5</em>) defines the severity of AUD (mild, moderate, or severe) based on the number of criteria met.<sup>4</sup> Previous versions of the <em>DSM-5</em> had separate diagnoses for alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence, but it no longer separates these diagnoses.<sup>1</sup> Currently, there is no firm consensus worldwide regarding the definition of risky drinking. In addition, the definition of a standard drink differs by country.<sup>1</sup> Any alcohol use is considered unhealthy in pregnant women and adolescents.<sup>1</sup> In adolescents, the definition of moderate- or high-risk alcohol use varies by age, based on days of use per year.<sup>5</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Excessive alcohol use is one of the most common causes of premature mortality in the United States. From 2006 to 2010, an estimated 88,000 alcohol-attributable deaths occurred annually in the United States, caused by both acute conditions (eg, injuries from motor vehicle collisions) and chronic conditions (eg, alcoholic liver disease).<sup>1,6</sup> Alcohol use during pregnancy is also one of the major preventable causes of birth defects and developmental disabilities.<sup>7</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Detection</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that numerous brief screening instruments can detect unhealthy alcohol use with acceptable sensitivity and specificity in primary care settings.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Benefits of Early Detection and Behavioral Counseling Interventions</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no studies that directly evaluated whether screening for unhealthy alcohol use in primary care settings in adolescents and adults, including pregnant women, leads to reduced unhealthy alcohol use; improved risky behaviors; or improved health, social, or legal outcomes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that brief behavioral counseling interventions in adults who screen positive are associated with reduced unhealthy alcohol use. There were reductions in both the odds of exceeding recommended drinking limits and heavy use episodes at 6- to 12-month follow-up. In pregnant women, brief counseling interventions increased the likelihood that women remained abstinent from alcohol use during pregnancy. The magnitude of these benefits is moderate. Epidemiologic literature links reductions in alcohol use with reductions in risk for morbidity and mortality and provides indirect support that reduced alcohol consumption may help improve some health outcomes.<sup>1,8</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence that brief behavioral counseling interventions in adolescents were associated with reduced alcohol use.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Harms of Screening and Behavioral Counseling Interventions</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF bounds the harms of screening and brief behavioral counseling interventions for unhealthy alcohol use in adults, including pregnant women, as small to none, based on the likely minimal harms of the screening instruments, the noninvasive nature of the interventions, and the absence of reported harms in the evidence on behavioral interventions. When direct evidence is limited, absent, or restricted to select populations or clinical scenarios, the USPSTF may place conceptual upper or lower bounds on the magnitude of benefit or harms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the harms of screening and brief behavioral counseling interventions for alcohol use in adolescents.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">USPSTF Assessment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening and brief behavioral counseling interventions for unhealthy alcohol use in the primary care setting in adults 18 years or older, including pregnant women, is of moderate net benefit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to determine the benefits and harms of screening for unhealthy alcohol use in the primary care setting in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years.</p><h2>Table.

recommendation applies to adults 18 years or older, including pregnant women. The &ldquo;I&rdquo; statement applies to adolescents aged 12 to 17 years. These recommendations do not apply to persons who have a current diagnosis of or who are seeking evaluation or treatment for alcohol abuse or dependence.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Screening Tests</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Of the available screening tools, the USPSTF determined that 1- to 3-item screening instruments have the best accuracy for assessing unhealthy alcohol use in adults 18 years or older.<sup>1</sup> These instruments include the abbreviated Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test&ndash;Consumption (AUDIT-C) and the NIAAA-recommended Single Alcohol Screening Question (SASQ).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The abbreviated AUDIT-C has good sensitivity and specificity for detecting the full spectrum of unhealthy alcohol use across multiple populations.<sup>1,9</sup> The AUDIT-C has 3 questions about frequency of alcohol use, typical amount of alcohol use, and occasions of heavy use, and takes 1 to 2 minutes to administer. The USAUDIT and USAUDIT-C are based on US standards. Preliminary evidence (1 study) suggests that the USAUDIT (specifically the USAUDIT-C) may be more valuable in identifying at-risk college drinkers.<sup>10</sup> The SASQ also has adequate sensitivity and specificity across the unhealthy alcohol use spectrum and requires less than 1 minute to administer, asking &ldquo;How many times in the past year have you had 5 [for men] or 4 [for women and all adults older than 65 years] or more drinks in a day?&rdquo;<sup>1,2</sup> The Cut down, Annoyed, Guilty, Eye-opener (CAGE) tool is well known but only detects alcohol dependence rather than the full spectrum of unhealthy alcohol use.<sup>1,11</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When patients screen positive on a brief screening instrument (eg, SASQ or AUDIT-C), clinicians should ensure follow-up with a more in-depth risk assessment to confirm unhealthy alcohol use and determine the next steps of care. Evidence supports the use of brief instruments with higher sensitivity and lower specificity as initial screening, followed by a longer instrument with greater specificity (eg, AUDIT). The AUDIT has 10 questions: 3 questions covering frequency of alcohol use, typical amount of alcohol use, and occasions of heavy use, and 7 questions on the signs of alcohol dependence and common problems associated with alcohol use (eg, being unable to stop once you start drinking). It requires approximately 2 to 5 minutes to administer.<sup>1,12</sup> If AUDIT is used as an initial screening test, clinicians may use a lower cutoff (such as 3, 4, or 5) to balance sensitivity and specificity in screening for the full spectrum of unhealthy alcohol use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Screening instruments have also been specifically developed for various populations. Screening tools for pregnant women include Tolerance, Worried, Eye-opener, Amnesia, Kut down (TWEAK)<sup>13</sup>; Tolerance, Annoyed, Cut down, Eye-opener (T-ACE)<sup>14</sup>; Parents, Partner, Past, Present Pregnancy (4P&rsquo;s Plus)<sup>15</sup>; and Normal drinker, Eye-opener, Tolerance (NET).<sup>16</sup> The NIAAA and American Academy of Pediatrics recommend the Car, Relax, Alone, Forget, Family, Friends, Trouble (CRAFFT) screening instrument for identifying risky substance use in adolescents.<sup>17</sup> The NIAAA also recommends asking patients about their own alcohol use as well as their friends&rsquo; alcohol use.<sup>5</sup> The Comorbidity Alcohol Risk Evaluation Tool (CARET) is used in older adults.<sup>18</sup> The Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST), developed by the World Health Organization (WHO), screens for substance and alcohol use in adults.<sup>1,19</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Behavioral Counseling Interventions</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Behavioral counseling interventions for unhealthy alcohol use vary in their specific components, administration, length, and number of interactions. Thirty percent of the interventions reviewed by the USPSTF were web-based. Nearly all of the interventions consisted of 4 or fewer sessions; the median number of sessions was 1 (range, 0-21). The median length of time of contact was 30 minutes (range, 1-600 minutes). Most of the interventions had a total contact time of 2 hours or less.<sup>1</sup> Primary care settings often used the Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) approach. Interventions targeting adults other than college students (including pregnant and postpartum women) were more likely to take place in primary care settings, have multiple sessions, and involve a primary care team.<sup>1</sup> Most interventions involved giving general feedback to participants (eg, how their drinking fits with recommended limits, or how to reduce alcohol use). The most commonly reported intervention component was use of personalized normative feedback sessions, in which participants were shown how their alcohol use compares with that of others; more than half of the included trials and almost all trials in young adults used this technique.<sup>1</sup> Most trials in young adults involved 1 or 2 in-person or web-based personalized normative feedback sessions in university settings. Personalized normative feedback was often combined with motivational interviewing or more extensive cognitive behavioral counseling. Other cognitive behavioral strategies, such as drinking diaries, action plans, alcohol use &ldquo;prescriptions,&rdquo; stress management, or problem solving were also frequently used. About one-third of the intervention trials in general and older adult populations involved a primary care team.<sup>1</sup> The USPSTF was unable to identify specific intervention characteristics or components that were clearly associated with improved outcomes.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no evidence to suggest that patients of different race/ethnicity or lower socioeconomic status have a lower likelihood of benefit from interventions. Effects of interventions were also similar in men and in women.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Screening Intervals</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF did not find adequate evidence to recommend an optimal screening interval for unhealthy alcohol use in adults.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>\r\n\r\n<h4 align=\"left\">Potential Preventable Burden</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2016, the National Survey on Drug Use and Health reported that an estimated 9.2% of adolescents aged 12 to 17 years drink alcohol and 4.9% had an episode of binge drinking in the last 30 days.<sup>20</sup> Each year, excessive drinking in underage youth leads to more than 4300 deaths.<sup>21</sup> Driving while under the influence of alcohol is particularly hazardous among adolescents. The 2015 Youth Risk Behavior Survey found that about 8% of high school students who drove a car in the last 30 days reported driving after drinking alcohol, and 20% reported riding with a driver who had been drinking.<sup>22</sup> In 2010, 1 in 5 teen drivers involved in a fatal motor vehicle collision had some alcohol in their system, and most had blood alcohol levels higher than the legal limit for adults.<sup>23</sup> An estimated 97,000 students aged 18 to 24 years have reported an alcohol-related sexual assault or date rape; 696,000 students aged 18 to 24 years have been assaulted by another student who was under the influence of alcohol.<sup>24,25</sup> An estimated 1 in 4 college students report academic consequences from drinking such as missing class, doing poorly on examinations or papers, falling behind in class, and receiving lower grades.<sup>1,24,26</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h4 align=\"left\">Potential Harms</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Possible harms of screening for unhealthy alcohol use include stigma, anxiety, labeling, discrimination, privacy concerns, and interference with the patient-clinician relationship. The USPSTF did not find any evidence that specifically examined the harms of screening for alcohol use in adolescents.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4 align=\"left\"><em>Current Practice</em></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Research suggests that although a majority of pediatricians and family practice clinicians report providing some alcohol prevention services to adolescent patients, they do not consistently screen and counsel for alcohol misuse.<sup>27</sup> Survey results indicate that screening was more likely if adolescents were older (aged 15 to 17 years).<sup>27</sup> However, the quality of screening practices, tools used, and interventions provided varied widely. Current data on rates of screening are lacking. Reported barriers to screening include time constraints, lack of knowledge about best practices, and lack of services for adolescent patients who screen positive.<sup>1,28</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Useful Resources</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The AUDIT and AUDIT-C, which screen for unhealthy alcohol use in adults 18 years or older, including pregnant women, are available from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration (SAMHSA), as well as other resources.<sup>29,30</sup> More information about SASQ and counseling for unhealthy alcohol use is available from the NIAAA.<sup>31</sup> Clinician guides are available from the WHO<sup>32</sup> and the American Academy of Family Physicians.<sup>33</sup> An implementation guide for primary care practices is available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.<sup>34</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Community Preventive Services Task Force recommends electronic screening and brief interventions to reduce excessive alcohol consumption in adults. It found limited information on the effectiveness of electronic screening and brief interventions in adolescents.<sup>35</sup> The Community Preventive Services Task Force has also evaluated public health interventions (ie, interventions occurring outside of the clinical practice setting) to prevent excessive alcohol consumption.<sup>36</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF has made recommendations on screening for and interventions to reduce the unhealthy use of other substances, including illicit drugs<sup>37</sup> and tobacco.<sup>38</sup></p><h2>Other Considerations</h2><h3 align=\"left\">Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF has identified several research gaps. Although difficult, conducting a trial with an unscreened comparison group to understand the population-level effects of screening in primary care settings would be valuable. More direct evidence is needed on the harms associated with screening and behavioral interventions. The USPSTF found a preliminary study that evaluated the USAUDIT and USAUDIT-C, recent US adaptations of the AUDIT and AUDIT-C. Further test performance studies are needed to confirm their accuracy in identifying unhealthy alcohol use in various populations. More evidence on important clinical outcomes is needed, such as longer-term morbidity, mortality, health care utilization, and social and legal outcomes. Trials designed a priori to report subgroup effects in diverse populations (eg, by age, sex, race/ethnicity, or baseline severity) would be useful. Limited evidence is available to assess the effects of screening and behavioral counseling in adolescents, and high-quality studies specifically addressing this population are needed. In addition, studies in adolescents are often conducted in school settings, which may not translate to primary care settings. More studies of adolescents in primary care settings are needed.</p><h2>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h2><p>This recommendation replaces the 2013 USPSTF recommendation statement on screening and behavioral counseling interventions for alcohol misuse. The term &ldquo;alcohol misuse,&rdquo; used in the 2013 recommendation, has been replaced by the term &ldquo;unhealthy alcohol use.&rdquo;</p>","other":"<h2>Recommendations of Others</h2><p>The US Surgeon General,<sup>52</sup> NIAAA,<sup>2</sup> Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,<sup>34</sup> and ASAM<sup>53</sup> recommend routinely screening adult patients for unhealthy alcohol use and providing them with appropriate interventions, if needed. The US Department of Veterans Affairs recommends annual screening with the AUDIT-C and SASQ.<sup>54</sup> The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends screening all adolescent patients for alcohol use with a formal, validated screening tool (such as the CRAFFT) at every health supervision visit and appropriate acute care visits, and responding to screening results with the appropriate brief intervention and referral if indicated. Pediatricians should become familiar with adolescent SBIRT approaches and their potential for incorporation into universal screening and comprehensive care of adolescents in the medical home.<sup>55</sup> The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists<sup>56</sup> and WHO<sup>57</sup> recommend screening all women for unhealthy alcohol use before pregnancy and in their first trimester with a validated tool, and offering a brief intervention to all pregnant women who use alcohol.</p>","discussion":"<h2>Discussion</h2><h3 align=\"left\">Burden of Disease</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>High-risk drinking increased by almost 30% between 2001-2002 and 2012-2013.<sup>26</sup> In 2016, an estimated 26.2% of adults 18 years or older reported heavy-use (binge drinking) episodes and 6.6% reported heavy drinking within the previous month<sup>20</sup>; an estimated 7.8% of men and 4.2% of women met the criteria for AUD.<sup>20</sup> Unhealthy alcohol use is the third-leading preventable cause of death in the United States.<sup>6,39,40</sup> One of 10 deaths among adults aged 20 to 64 years can be attributed to excessive alcohol use.<sup>6,39,40</sup> In the United States, from 2006 to 2010, an estimated 88,000 deaths each year were attributed to alcohol use, with an estimated 2.5 million years of potential life lost.<sup>6</sup> Of these 88,000 deaths, 44% were from chronic conditions (eg, alcoholic liver disease) and 56% were from acute conditions (eg, injuries from motor vehicle collisions).<sup>6</sup> Excessive alcohol use also contributed to 3.2% to 3.7% of cancer deaths, including breast, gastrointestinal, oral cavity, and neck cancer.<sup>41</sup> Among adolescents aged 12 to 17 years, 9.2% reported being current alcohol users and 4.9% reported heavy use episodes in the previous month. Approximately 488,000 adolescents have AUD (2.4% and 1.5% of female and male adolescents, respectively).<sup>20</sup> In 2005, unhealthy alcohol use in college students aged 18 to 24 years contributed to an estimated death of 1825 students through unintentional injuries (eg, motor vehicle collisions),<sup>25,42</sup> and about 1 in 4 students report that alcohol use contributes to missing or falling behind in classes, low grades, and poor performance on examinations and papers.<sup>25,42</sup> In 2010, excessive alcohol use cost the United States an estimated $249 billion in loss in workplace productivity, health care expenses, criminal justice expenses, and motor vehicle collisions.<sup>43</sup> Alcohol use during pregnancy can result in preterm birth and low birth weight. It is a major preventable cause of birth defects and developmental disabilities, including fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, and affects development of the fetal brain, endocrine system, gastrointestinal tract, heart, kidney, and liver.<sup>7</sup> The 2011-2013 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey shows that 1 in 10 pregnant women aged 18 to 44 years reported consuming alcohol in the previous month, and 3.1% participated in binge drinking.<sup>44</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Scope of Review</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF commissioned a systematic evidence review to update its 2013 recommendation on screening for unhealthy alcohol use in primary care. In the previous recommendation, the USPSTF used the term &ldquo;alcohol misuse&rdquo; to define a wide range of drinking behaviors (eg, risky or hazardous alcohol use, harmful alcohol use, and alcohol abuse or dependence).<sup>45</sup> In accordance with the ASAM, the current recommendation uses the term &ldquo;unhealthy use&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;misuse.&rdquo; The ASAM defines &ldquo;unhealthy use&rdquo; as any use of alcohol that increases the risk of health consequences or that has already led to health consequences, including an AUD diagnosis.<sup>1,4</sup> The evidence review examined the effectiveness of screening to reduce unhealthy alcohol use, morbidity, mortality, or risky behaviors and to improve health, social, or legal outcomes; the accuracy of various screening approaches; the effectiveness of counseling interventions to reduce unhealthy alcohol use, morbidity, mortality, or risky behaviors and to improve health, social, or legal outcomes; and the harms of screening and behavioral counseling interventions. The review did not include treatment with medications because medications are used to treat severe AUD and are not routinely used in screen-detected persons. Interventions to prevent alcohol use in adolescents was determined to be out of scope for this review.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Accuracy of Screening Tests</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Forty-five studies (n = 277,881) addressed the accuracy of screening tools; 10 studies in adolescents, 5 in young adults, 27 in general adult populations, 1 in older adults, and 2 in pregnant or postpartum women. Twenty-eight studies were fair quality and 17 were good quality. Most studies took place in the United States (62%), and 51% of the studies recruited patients from primary care settings.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Studies evaluated AUDIT, AUDIT-C, ASSIST, and a variety of 1- or 2-item screening tests for detecting the full spectrum of unhealthy alcohol use. Screening instruments addressed a variety of elements, such as quantity of drinks, drinking frequency, or typical total number of drinks over a specific period (quantity &times; frequency), and a variety of response categories and cutoffs.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reference standards were structured diagnostic interviews (eg, Composite International Diagnostic Interview, Alcohol Use Disorder and Associated Disabilities Interview Schedule, or Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview Plus). Some studies used a diagnostic interview in combination with other instruments (eg, in combination with the ASSIST, to identify the full spectrum of unhealthy alcohol use) or a timeline follow-back interview.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For adults, the AUDIT, AUDIT-C, and 1- or 2-item screening tests had acceptable sensitivity and specificity to detect the full spectrum of unhealthy alcohol use. Studies of the SASQ reported sensitivity of 0.73 to 0.88 (95% CI range, 0.65-0.89) and specificity of 0.74 to 1.00 (95% CI range, 0.69-1.00) for detecting unhealthy alcohol use (4 studies [n = 44,461]). Other 1- or 2-item screening tests generally showed sensitivity of 0.70 or greater. The standard of 6 or more drinks per occasion tended to have decreased sensitivity compared with the standard of 5 (men)/4 (women) or more drinks, often with nonoverlapping confidence intervals. Other adult populations (young adults, older adults, and pregnant women) had similar results.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seven studies (n = 8852) evaluating the AUDIT for the detection of unhealthy alcohol use in general adult populations, using the recommended cutoff of higher than 8, reported a wide range of sensitivity (0.38-0.73 [95% CI, 0.33-0.84]) but high specificity (0.89-0.97 [95% CI, 0.84-0.98]). In many studies, sensitivity improved at lower cutoffs. Three studies (n = 2782) conducted in US primary care settings showed better accuracy (sensitivity, 0.64-0.86 [95% CI, 0.57-0.91] and specificity, 0.74-0.94 [95% CI, 0.68-0.95] at cutoffs of 3, 4, or 5).<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sensitivity of the AUDIT-C for detecting unhealthy alcohol use in adults was similar to that of 1- or 2-item screening instruments. In most studies, the range of sensitivity was 0.73 to 0.97 for females (95% CI, 0.62-0.99; 5 studies [n = 2714]) and 0.82 to 1.00 for males (95% CI, 0.75-1.00; 4 studies [n = 1038]) at the standard cutoffs of 3 or higher (female) and 4 or higher (male), but the range of specificity was much wider (0.28-0.91 [95% CI, 0.21-0.93] and 0.34-0.89 [95% CI, 0.25-0.92] for females and males, respectively). Evidence on the use of the AUDIT-C in younger adults, older adults, and pregnant women was lacking.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h4 align=\"left\">Pregnant Women</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>No studies among pregnant women reported on the test accuracy of any screening test for alcohol use or the full spectrum of unhealthy alcohol use (eg, AUDIT-C, AUDIT, ASSIST, TWEAK, or T-ACE).<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A study in American Indian women reported the test accuracy of 1- or 2-item screening instruments (quantity &times; frequency) to screen for any alcohol use during pregnancy. At the optimal cutoff, sensitivity was 0.77 (95% CI, 0.68-0.83) and specificity was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.86-0.96).<sup>46</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h4 align=\"left\">Adolescents</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Although multiple studies among adolescents demonstrated good accuracy of 1- or 2-item screening instruments and the AUDIT for detecting AUD, none reported on test accuracy for screening for the full spectrum of unhealthy alcohol use.<sup>1</sup> Only 1 study evaluated the accuracy of detecting unhealthy alcohol use in adolescents. One study (n = 225) in a German high school reported on the test accuracy of the AUDIT-C for detecting the full spectrum of unhealthy alcohol use (males and females combined), with a sensitivity of 0.73 (95% CI, 0.60-0.83) and a specificity of 0.81 (95% CI, 0.74-0.86) at the optimal cutoff of 5 or higher.<sup>47</sup> Evidence to determine whether brief (1- to 3-item) screening instruments or the AUDIT can detect alcohol use in adolescents was lacking.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Effectiveness of Screening and Behavioral Counseling Interventions</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>No trials examined the direct effects of screening for unhealthy alcohol use on alcohol use or health, social, or legal outcomes.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Alcohol Use and Other Risky Behaviors</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Ten good-quality trials and 58 fair-quality trials (n = 36,528) reported on alcohol use and other risky behaviors. The majority of trials (60%) were conducted in the United States. Intervention settings were predominantly in primary care clinics (62%).<sup>1</sup> Two trials were in adolescents, 22 in college-aged or young adults, 29 in general adult populations, 4 in older adults, and 11 in pregnant or postpartum women.<sup>1</sup> Trials were generally limited to study participants who reported a prespecified level of alcohol use on a screening instrument such as the AUDIT. Outcomes were generally reported at 6- to 12-month follow-up or during the late pregnancy/early postpartum period for abstinence during pregnancy. Trials demonstrated high heterogeneity; effect size was not clearly associated with any intervention characteristics. Data on effectiveness in important subpopulations were very limited.<sup>1</sup> The most commonly reported subpopulation analysis (by sex) did not show differences in the effectiveness of the interventions.<sup>1</sup> The most commonly reported alcohol use outcome was number of drinks per week. Among 37 adult trials (n = 15,974), adults in intervention groups reduced the number of drinks per week more than adults in control groups (weighted mean difference between groups in change from baseline, &minus;1.59 [95% CI, &minus;2.15 to &minus;1.03; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 63%). The proportion exceeding recommended drinking limits was reduced (odds ratio [OR], 0.60 [95% CI, 0.53 to 0.67]), as well as the proportion reporting a heavy-use episode (OR, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.58 to 0.77]). Analyses limited to trials conducted in US primary care settings suggest that effects in the most applicable trials were comparable or larger than the overall effect (weighted mean difference, &minus;2.82 [95% CI, &minus;3.87 to &minus;1.76]).<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interventions among adults resulted in an absolute increase of 14% more participants drinking within recommended limits, meaning 7 adults would need to be treated to achieve 1 adult drinking within recommended limits (number needed to treat, 7.2 [95% CI, 6.2 to 11.5]).<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interventions increased the proportion of pregnant women reporting abstinence (OR, 2.26 [95% CI, 1.43 to 3.56]). Based on these results, interventions doubled the odds that women remained abstinent from alcohol during pregnancy (number needed to treat, 6.0 [95% CI, 4.3 to 12.5]).<sup>1</sup> Evidence on the effects of interventions to reduce unhealthy alcohol use in adolescents was limited to 2 trials; both found mixed results for reduced alcohol use.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Benefits continued 24 months or beyond in 4 of 7 trials with longer-term outcomes. Very limited data suggest that benefits from alcohol use interventions can be maintained over 2 to 4 years, including the number of drinks per week and some health outcomes.<sup>1</sup> However, several trials in younger adults found that beneficial effects appeared at 6 months but were no longer statistically significant at 12 months, suggesting that beneficial effects may deteriorate more quickly in younger adults.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Few changes in other behavioral outcomes (eg, drug use, sex after alcohol use, and seeking help for unhealthy alcohol use) were either observed or were rarely reported.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Health, Social, and Legal Outcomes</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Forty-one good- and fair-quality trials (n = 20,324) reported health, social, and legal outcomes; however, no particular outcomes were commonly reported. In addition, reported outcomes were generally not statistically significant and inconsistently favored the intervention group.<sup>1</sup> In adults, 8 trials reported a statistically nonsignificant reduction in all-cause mortality (OR, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.34 to 1.19]).<sup>1</sup> One good-quality study showed reductions in emergency department visits and controlled substance or liquor violations at 4-year follow-up.<sup>48</sup> Trials in young adults demonstrated a small reduction in alcohol-related consequences (standardized mean difference, &minus;0.06 [95% CI, &minus;0.11 to &minus;0.01]).<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Potential Harms of Screening and Behavioral Counseling Interventions</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Potential harms of screening include stigma, labeling, discrimination, privacy concerns, and interference with the patient-clinician relationship.<sup>1</sup> In addition, there may be legal concerns for pregnant women in some states.<sup>49</sup> No studies evaluated the harms of screening for unhealthy alcohol use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One possible harm of behavioral counseling interventions could be an unexpected paradoxical increase in alcohol consumption. One good-quality and 5 fair-quality trials (n = 3650) reported on harms. There was very limited evidence on intervention harms.<sup>1</sup> Interventions reviewed and discussed above generally reported benefits, including reductions in alcohol consumption. Therefore, paradoxical and theoretical increases in alcohol use with interventions are unlikely.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Adequate evidence supports a moderate beneficial effect of screening for unhealthy alcohol use followed by brief behavioral counseling interventions in adults. Screening and behavioral counseling interventions in the primary care setting can reduce unhealthy drinking behaviors in adults, including heavy episodic drinking, high daily or weekly levels of alcohol consumption, and exceeding recommended drinking limits. Although the USPSTF found limited specific evidence for pregnant women, it determined that available studies of behavioral counseling interventions for unhealthy alcohol use in pregnant women supported increased likelihood of alcohol abstinence during pregnancy with intervention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Available studies have not focused on the effects of screening and behavioral counseling interventions on longer-term health outcomes, such as alcohol-related disease or death. However, adequate epidemiologic evidence links reduced levels of alcohol consumption with a reduced risk for morbidity and mortality, providing indirect support that behavioral counseling interventions that reduce acute and sustained alcohol intake levels can help improve some health outcomes of unhealthy alcohol use.8 A large body of observational evidence also links alcohol use in pregnant women with an increased risk for subsequent birth defects, such as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders.<sup>50,51</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given the noninvasive nature of screening and behavioral counseling interventions for unhealthy alcohol use, the USPSTF determined the magnitude of harms to be small to none in adults and pregnant women. Therefore, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the net benefit of screening and brief behavioral counseling interventions for unhealthy alcohol use in adults, including pregnant women, is moderate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Evidence in adolescents is limited. As such, the USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening and brief behavioral counseling interventions for unhealthy alcohol use in adolescents.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from June 5, 2018, to July 2, 2018. Some comments expressed concerns about the lack of discussion of specific populations. In response, the USPSTF added language about the harms of alcohol consumption in adolescents to the Clinical Considerations section and the harms of alcohol use during pregnancy to the Discussion section. The USPSTF also added more useful resources to the Clinical Considerations section. Some comments requested clarification on which screening tools were being discussed; the USPSTF clarified this by adding references.</p>","topic":"Unhealthy Alcohol Use in Adolescents and Adults: Screening and Behavioral Counseling Interventions","keywords":"Alcohol|Drinking|Unhealthy Alcohol Use|Alcohol Misuse","pubDate":"2018-11-13","categories":["1","8"],"tool":["207","209","208"]},"413":{"topicType":"Screening and Counseling","topicYear":2019,"uspstfAlias":"brca-related-cancer-risk-assessment-genetic-counseling-and-genetic-testing","specific":[507,508],"title":"BRCA-Related Cancer: Risk Assessment, Genetic Counseling, and Genetic Testing","rationale":"<h2>Rationale</h2><h3 align=\"left\">Importance</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Potentially harmful mutations of the <em>BRCA1/</em>2 genes are associated with increased risk for breast, ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal cancer.<sup>1-6</sup> For women in the United States, breast cancer is the most common cancer after nonmelanoma skin cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death.<sup>7</sup> In the general population, <em>BRCA1/2</em> mutations occur in an estimated 1 in 300 to 500 women and account for 5% to 10% of breast cancer cases and 15% of ovarian cancer cases.<sup>8-11</sup> A woman&rsquo;s risk for breast cancer increases if she has clinically significant mutations in the <em>BRCA1/2</em> genes.<sup>12,13</sup> Mutations in the <em>BRCA1/2</em> genes increase breast cancer risk to 45% to 65% by age 70 years.

It includes women who have never been diagnosed with <em>BRCA</em>-related cancer, as well as those with a previous breast, ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal cancer diagnosis who have completed treatment and are considered cancer free but have not been previously tested. While this recommendation applies to women, the net benefit estimates are driven by biological sex (ie, male/female) rather than gender identity. Persons should consider their sex at birth to determine which recommendation best applies to them.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Assessment of Risk</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Mutations in the <em>BRCA1/2</em> genes cluster in families, showing an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance in either the mother&rsquo;s or father&rsquo;s family. When taking medical and family history information from patients, primary care clinicians should ask about specific types of cancer, primary cancer sites, which family members were affected, and whether relatives had multiple types of primary cancer. Clinicians should also inquire about the age at diagnosis, age at death, and sex of affected family members, both immediate (ie, parents and siblings) as well as more distant (ie, aunts, uncles, grandparents, and cousins).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For women who have family members with breast, ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal cancer or have a personal history of these types of cancer, primary care clinicians may use appropriate brief familial risk assessment tools to determine the need for in-depth genetic counseling. Tools evaluated by the USPSTF include the Ontario Family History Assessment Tool (<a href=\"#tab1\">Table 1</a>), Manchester Scoring System (<a href=\"#tab2\">Table 2</a>), Referral Screening Tool (<a href=\"#tab3\">Table 3</a>), Pedigree Assessment Tool (<a href=\"#tab4\">Table 4</a>),&nbsp;7-Question Family History Screening Tool (<a href=\"#tab5\">Table 5</a>), International Breast Cancer Intervention Study instrument (Tyrer-Cuzick) (<a href=\"#tab6\">Table 6</a>), and brief versions of BRCAPRO. Each of these tools has been validated and accurately estimate the likelihood of carrying a harmful <em>BRCA1/2</em> mutation. They can be used to guide referrals to genetic counseling for more definitive risk assessment.<sup>28</sup> General breast cancer risk assessment models (eg, the National Cancer Institute Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool, which is based on the Gail model) are not designed to identify <em>BRCA</em>-related cancer risk and should not be used for this purpose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In general, these brief familial risk assessment tools include factors associated with increased likelihood of potentially harmful <em>BRCA1/2</em> mutations. These include breast cancer diagnosis before age 50 years, bilateral breast cancer, presence of both breast and ovarian cancer in one individual, male family members with breast cancer, multiple cases of breast cancer in the family, 1 or more family members with 2 primary types of <em>BRCA</em>-related cancer (such as ovarian cancer), and Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry. The USPSTF recognizes that each risk assessment tool has advantages and limitations and found insufficient evidence to recommend one over another.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Genetic Counseling</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The process of genetic counseling includes detailed kindred analysis and risk assessment for potentially harmful <em>BRCA1/2</em> mutations. It also includes identification of candidates for testing, patient education, discussion of the benefits and harms of genetic testing, interpretation of results after testing, and discussion of management options. Genetic counseling about <em>BRCA1/2</em> mutation testing should be performed by trained health professionals, including suitably trained primary care clinicians. Several professional organizations describe the skills and training necessary to provide comprehensive genetic counseling.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Genetic Testing</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Testing for <em>BRCA1/2</em> mutations should be performed only when an individual has personal or family history that suggests an inherited cancer susceptibility, when an individual is willing to talk with a health professional who is suitably trained to provide genetic counseling and interpret test results, and when test results will aid in decision-making. Clinical practice guidelines recommend that <em>BRCA1/2</em> mutation testing begin with a relative with known <em>BRCA</em>-related cancer, including male relatives, to determine if a clinically significant mutation is detected in the family before testing individuals without cancer.<sup>29</sup> If an affected family member with a <em>BRCA</em>-related cancer is not available, then the relative with the highest probability of mutation should be tested. The type of mutation analysis required depends on family history. Individuals from families with known mutations or from ancestry groups in which certain mutations are more common (eg, Ashkenazi Jewish founder mutations) can be tested for these specific mutations. Because risk assessment is primarily based on family history, it is unclear how women with a limited or unknown family history should be assessed for <em>BRCA1/2</em> mutation risk and potential referral to counseling or genetic testing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tests for <em>BRCA1/2</em> mutations are highly sensitive and specific for known mutations. The availability of testing options has changed since the 2013 US Supreme Court ruling that determined human genes are not patentable (<em>Association for Molecular Pathology et al v Myriad Genetics Inc et al</em>).<sup>30</sup> Previously, <em>BRCA1/2</em> mutation testing in the United States was mainly conducted by 1 laboratory. Since the ruling, the number of testing options has significantly increased, with more than 80 multigene panels that include <em>BRCA1/2</em>, as well as tests marketed directly to consumers.<sup>31</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Guidelines from the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, which were updated in 2015, recommend new standard terminology for reporting <em>BRCA1/2</em> mutations identified by genetic tests. These include a 5-tier terminology system using the terms &ldquo;pathogenic,&rdquo; &ldquo;likely pathogenic,&rdquo; &ldquo;uncertain significance,&rdquo; &ldquo;likely benign,&rdquo; and &ldquo;benign.&rdquo;<sup>32</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Treatment and Interventions</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Management of increased cancer risk related to <em>BRCA1/2</em> mutations is beyond the scope of this Recommendation Statement. In general, care for women with harmful <em>BRCA1/2</em> mutations consists of a variety of interventions to lower future cancer risk. This includes intensive screening, risk-reducing medications, and risk-reducing mastectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Additional Tools and Resources</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The National Cancer Institute Cancer Genetics Services Directory provides a list of professionals who offer services related to cancer genetics, including cancer risk assessment, genetic counseling, and genetic testing.<sup>33</sup></p><h2>Other Considerations</h2><h3 align=\"left\">Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Research on risk assessment and testing for <em>BRCA1/2</em> mutations has focused on short-term outcomes for highly selected women in referral centers. To determine the best approaches for population-based risk assessment and testing, more research is needed about mutation prevalence and effects on the general population as well as ethnicities or ancestries associated with <em>BRCA1/2</em> mutations. Because risk assessment is primarily based on family history, more research is needed to better understand how women with an unknown family history should be assessed for <em>BRCA1/2</em> mutation risk. Additional studies are needed, including comparative effectiveness trials, of approaches to risk screening and strategies to improve access to genetic counseling, as well as <em>BRCA1/2</em> testing for high-risk individuals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It would be helpful to understand which methods of delivery of genetic counseling are most effective, including those that can increase access to genetic counseling in rural or other settings with limited access. Trials comparing types of clinicians and protocols could address these questions. The consequences of genetic testing for individuals and their relatives require more study. Well-designed investigations using standardized measures and diverse study populations are needed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An expanded database or registry of patients receiving genetic counseling for inherited breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility or who are tested for <em>BRCA1/2</em> mutations would provide useful information about predictors of cancer and response to interventions. Additional data are needed from women of varying socioeconomic and racial/ethnic groups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For women who are <em>BRCA1/2</em> mutation carriers, studies about the effectiveness of intensive cancer screening and risk-reducing medications and the effects of age at intervention on improving long-term outcomes are needed. This research would increase knowledge of the relative benefits and harms of interventions that are provided on the basis of genetic risk information.</p><h2>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h2><p>In 2005 and 2013, the USPSTF recommended that women whose family history is associated with an increased risk for potentially harmful mutations in the <em>BRCA1/2</em> genes be referred for genetic counseling and evaluation for <em>BRCA1/2</em> testing. It also recommended against routine referral for genetic counseling or routine <em>BRCA1/2</em> mutation testing for women whose family history is not associated with an increased risk for potentially harmful mutations in the <em>BRCA1/2</em> genes.<sup>14,147</sup> This Recommendation Statement is consistent with the USPSTF&rsquo;s previous recommendation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since 2013, the validity of genetic testing for <em>BRCA1/2</em> mutations has been established and the potential benefits and harms of previously reviewed interventions, such as risk-reducing medications and surgery, have been studied for longer follow-up periods. In addition, there have been more studies of newer imaging techniques (breast MRI), surgical procedures (salpingo-oophorectomy rather than oophorectomy alone), and medications (aromatase inhibitors). The updated recommendation expands the population eligible for screening to include women with a previous breast, ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal cancer diagnosis who have completed treatment and are considered cancer free and more explicitly includes ancestry associated with <em>BRCA1/2</em> mutations (ie, founder mutations) as a risk factor.</p>","other":"<h2>Other Related USPSTF Recommendations</h2><p>The USPSTF recommends that clinicians offer to prescribe risk-reducing medications such as tamoxifen, raloxifene, or aromatase inhibitors to women at increased risk for breast cancer and at low risk for adverse medication effects (B recommendation). It recommends against the routine use of medications for risk reduction of primary breast cancer in women not at increased risk for breast cancer (D recommendation).<sup>34</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF recommends against screening for ovarian cancer in women (D recommendation). This recommendation does not apply to women with known genetic mutations that increase their risk for ovarian cancer (eg, <em>BRCA1/2</em> mutations).<sup>35</sup> The USPSTF found insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of performing screening pelvic examinations in asymptomatic women for the early detection and treatment of a range of gynecologic conditions (I statement).<sup>36</sup></p><h2>Recommendations of Others</h2><p>The National Comprehensive Cancer Network provides specific criteria for genetic counseling and testing.<sup>29</sup> The American College of Medical Genetics and the American Society of Clinical Oncology recommend testing for <em>BRCA1/2</em> mutations only when an individual has personal or family cancer history suggestive of inherited cancer susceptibility, the test can be adequately interpreted, and the results will aid in management.<sup>148,149</sup> The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends performing a hereditary cancer risk assessment and subsequent referral to a specialist in cancer genetics if necessary.<sup>150</sup> The Society for Gynecologic Oncology recommends that individuals with a likelihood of inherited predisposition to cancer based on personal or family history should be offered genetic counseling.<sup>151</sup> The American Society of Breast Surgeons recommends that genetic testing be made available to all patients with a personal history of breast cancer.<sup>152</sup> The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommends that health care professionals respond to a patient who presents with concerns but should not, in most instances, actively seek to identify persons with a family history of breast cancer.<sup>153</sup> It recommends that in some circumstances, including when a patient has concerns about relatives with breast cancer, a first- and second-degree family history be taken in primary care to assess risk. Referral to secondary care is recommended if risk factors are identified in family history taking.<sup>153</sup> The European Society for Medical Oncology follows the recommendations of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence for initial risk assessment and the decision when to perform genetic counseling and testing.<sup>154</sup></p>","discussion":"<h2>Discussion</h2><h3 align=\"left\">Burden of Disease</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>For women, breast cancer is the most common cancer in the United States after nonmelanoma skin cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death.<sup>37</sup> In 2017, an estimated 252,710 women were diagnosed with breast cancer in the United States and 40,610 died of the disease.<sup>37</sup> Ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer death in women in the United States.<sup>37</sup> In 2017, an estimated 22,440 women were diagnosed with ovarian cancer and 14,080 died of the disease.<sup>37</sup> Mutations of the <em>BRCA1/2</em> genes are estimated to occur in 1 in 300 to 500 women in the general population<sup>8-11</sup> and account for 5% to 10% of breast cancer cases and 15% of ovarian cancer cases.<sup>9,11,38</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Estimates of the prevalence of potentially harmful <em>BRCA1/2</em> mutations vary by population.

The USPSTF reviewed interventions to reduce the risk for breast, ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal cancer in women with potentially harmful <em>BRCA1/2</em> mutations, including intensive cancer screening (eg, earlier and more frequent mammography or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] of the breast), medications (eg, tamoxifen, raloxifene, or aromatase inhibitors), and risk-reducing surgery (eg, mastectomy or salpingo-oophorectomy). Although male breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, and melanoma are associated with <em>BRCA1/2</em> mutations, discussion of these types of cancer is outside the scope of this recommendation.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Accuracy of Familial Risk Assessment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed studies of familial risk stratification tools that could be used in primary care settings to determine the likelihood of potentially harmful <em>BRCA1/2</em> mutations. These tools are primarily intended for use by health care clinicians untrained in genetic cancer risk assessment to guide referral to genetic counselors for more definitive evaluation. In general, these tools elicit information about factors associated with increased likelihood of <em>BRCA1/2</em> mutations, including family and personal history of cancer (including types of cancer and age of diagnosis) and ancestry (Ashkenazi Jewish). Because risk assessment is primarily based on family history, it is unclear how women with an unknown family history should be assessed for <em>BRCA1/2</em> mutation risk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Models that have been validated in studies include the Ontario Family History Assessment Tool (<a href=\"#tab1\">Table 1</a>),<sup>15-18</sup> Manchester Scoring System (<a href=\"#tab2\">Table 2</a>),<sup>16-21,41</sup> Referral Screening Tool (<a href=\"#tab3\">Table 3</a>),<sup>22</sup> Pedigree Assessment Tool (<a href=\"#tab4\">Table 4</a>),<sup>23,24</sup> 7-Question Family History Screening Tool (<a href=\"#tab5\">Table 5</a>),<sup>25</sup> and the International Breast Cancer Intervention Study instrument (also known as Tyrer-Cuzick) (<a href=\"#tab6\">Table 6</a>), and their variations.<sup>26</sup> The USPSTF found that these tools are clinically useful predictors of which individuals should be referred for genetic counseling. Compared with results of other models or genetic testing in studies, these tools all have sensitivity estimates between 77% and 100% and areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve between 0.68 and 0.96,<sup>28</sup> although some models have been evaluated in only 1 study.<sup>22,25,26</sup> The USPSTF reviewed a study of brief versions of BRCAPRO (eg, BRCAPRO-LYTE), designed for primary care clinicians, followed by the full BRCAPRO (used by genetic counselors) and found that the sequential testing scheme identified a similar number of <em>BRCA</em> mutation carriers as the full BRCAPRO.<sup>42</sup> The USPSTF recognizes that each risk assessment tool has advantages and limitations and found insufficient evidence to recommend one tool over another.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Effectiveness of Genetic Counseling, Genetic Testing, and Interventions</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>To understand the full benefits and harms of genetic counseling, the USPSTF reviewed studies on pretest and posttest counseling, <em>BRCA1/2</em> mutation testing, and interventions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4 align=\"left\">Pretest and Posttest Counseling</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed 28 studies on pretest counseling.<sup>43-72</sup> Studies reported measures of distress associated with genetic counseling for <em>BRCA</em>-related cancer, including cancer worry (17 studies), anxiety (13 studies), and depression (7 studies). In general, pretest genetic counseling either decreased or had no effect on breast cancer worry, anxiety, and depression.<sup>28</sup> Twenty-two studies examined understanding of risk, with most reporting either improved understanding (14 studies)<sup>45,48,53,55-58,61,64,65,67-69,72,73</sup> or no association (6 studies),<sup>43,52,59,62,70,71</sup> 1 study reporting decreased understanding,<sup>60</sup> and 1 study reporting mixed results.<sup>46</sup> Five studies that evaluated the effects of genetic counseling on <em>BRCA1/2</em> mutation testing intention found decreased intent to test in 4 studies<sup>45,53,58,67</sup> and increased intent in 1 study.<sup>74</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although several studies included discussion of management options as part of the pretest counseling process, none evaluated benefits or harms of counseling conducted after receiving test results.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4 align=\"left\"><em>BRCA1/2</em> Mutation Testing</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>One good-quality trial (n = 1034) of women and men of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry evaluated population-based <em>BRCA1/2</em> mutation testing vs family history&ndash;based testing.<sup>75</sup> Results showed that a strategy of population-based testing for founder mutations detected more <em>BRCA1/2</em> mutation carriers than testing persons who met family history criteria. However, no clinical outcomes were reported and, because not all participants had <em>BRCA1/2</em> mutation testing, the accuracy of this strategy could not be determined. Genetic testing generally improved risk perception, with increased perceived risk of breast and ovarian cancer risk in <em>BRCA1/2</em> mutation carriers and decreased perceived risk in persons testing negative.<sup>76,77</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Interventions</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Studied interventions to reduce risk for cancer in women who are <em>BRCA1/2</em> mutation carriers include earlier, more frequent, or more intensive cancer screening (eg, breast MRI or mammography); use of risk-reducing medications (eg, selective estrogen receptor modulators or aromatase inhibitors); and risk-reducing surgery (eg, mastectomy or salpingo-oophorectomy).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed 11 randomized clinical trials of selective estrogen receptor modulators and aromatase inhibitors, although none were conducted specifically in women who were <em>BRCA1/2</em> mutation carriers. Results of meta-analysis<sup>78</sup> indicated clinically significant reductions in invasive breast cancer with the use of tamoxifen, raloxifene, and aromatase inhibitors, with 7 fewer events per 1000 women for tamoxifen (4 trials),<sup>79-82</sup> 9 fewer events per 1000 women for raloxifene (2 trials),<sup>83,84</sup> and 16 fewer events per 1000 women for aromatase inhibitors (2 trials),<sup>85-89</sup> assuming 5 years of treatment. Tamoxifen reduced invasive breast cancer more than raloxifene in the head-to-head trial (relative risk, 1.24 [95% CI, 1.05-1.47]).<sup>90</sup> Risk reduction persisted at least 8 years after discontinuation in the 2 tamoxifen trials providing long-term follow-up data. All medications reduced estrogen receptor&ndash;positive, but not estrogen receptor&ndash;negative, invasive breast cancer. Breast cancer&ndash;specific and all-cause mortality were not reduced.<sup>78</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In cohort studies of high-risk women and women who were <em>BRCA1/2</em> mutation carriers, risk-reducing surgery such as mastectomy (6 studies),<sup>91-97</sup> oophorectomy (7 studies),<sup>98-104</sup> or salpingo-oophorectomy (2 studies)<sup>91,105</sup> were associated with reduced risk for breast or ovarian cancer. Bilateral mastectomy was associated with a 90% to 100% reduced breast cancer incidence and 81% to 100% reduced breast cancer mortality. Oophorectomy was associated with 81% to 100% reduced ovarian cancer incidence. In general, there was no association between oophorectomy or salpingo-oophorectomy and reduced breast cancer risk, although some studies showed reduced risk in younger women (age &lt;50 years).<sup>78,98,99</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no studies on the benefits of intensive screening for <em>BRCA</em>-related cancer on clinical outcomes in women who are <em>BRCA1/2</em> mutation carriers.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Harms of Genetic Counseling, Genetic Testing, and Interventions</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed the psychological effects of test results. Nine studies evaluated breast cancer worry or distress after genetic testing. Increased worry was found in 7 studies,<sup>77,106-111</sup> particularly in women who are <em>BRCA1/2</em> mutation carriers, and 2 studies reported decreased worry.<sup>112,113</sup> Studies reporting anxiety related to genetic testing were mixed, with 4 reporting increased anxiety,<sup>106,109,113,114</sup> 2 reporting decreased anxiety,<sup>111,115</sup> and 6 reporting no association.<sup>75,108,112,116-118</sup> Two studies noted higher anxiety in women who were not tested compared with those who were tested.<sup>111,119</sup> Of the 8 studies evaluating depression, none reported increases in anxiety after genetic testing.<sup>75,108,111,112,115,117,118,120</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Intensive screening for breast and ovarian cancer is associated with false-positive results, additional imaging tests, and surgery for women without cancer. In a retrospective analysis of a cohort of women with potentially harmful <em>BRCA1/2</em> mutations or first-degree relatives with <em>BRCA1/2</em> mutations, women screened with mammography were more likely to have additional imaging tests than those screened with MRI.<sup>121</sup> In 2 studies comparing mammography with MRI for breast cancer screening in which 18% to 100% of study participants were <em>BRCA1/2</em> mutation carriers, MRI was associated with higher false-positive rates (14% vs 5.5% in the first round of screening; <em>P</em>&lt;0.001;<sup>122</sup>&nbsp;15% vs 11% in another study<sup>121</sup>). Intensive screening for ovarian cancer using transvaginal ultrasound demonstrated high false-positive rates (3.4%).<sup>123</sup> A second study in women who were <em>BRCA1/2</em> mutation carriers reported a diagnostic surgery rate of 55% after annual screening with transvaginal ultrasound and serum tumor marker cancer antigen<sup>125</sup> measurements for women without cancer.<sup>124</sup> Most women did not experience anxiety after screening with MRI, mammography, or clinical breast examination, although women recalled for additional testing reported transient anxiety.<sup>125</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eight placebo-controlled trials and 1 head-to-head trial of tamoxifen and raloxifene reported harms of risk-reducing medications. Raloxifene and tamoxifen increased risk for thromboembolic events compared with placebo, and raloxifene caused fewer events than tamoxifen in the head-to-head trial.<sup>78,126,127</sup> An increased risk of endometrial cancer was seen with tamoxifen (4 cases per 1000 women) but not with raloxifene or aromatase inhibitors. Women using tamoxifen had more cataract procedures compared with placebo or raloxifene.<sup>79,90</sup> The most common adverse effects were vasomotor symptoms and vaginal discharge, itching, or dryness for tamoxifen and vasomotor symptoms and leg cramps for raloxifene.<sup>28</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thirteen studies of mastectomy<sup>128-140</sup> and 9 studies of oophorectomy or salpingo-oophorectomy<sup>141-145</sup> reported harms associated with surgical interventions, although most were small in size and had mixed outcomes. For mastectomy, complication rates ranged from 49% to 69%.<sup>28</sup> Complications included numbness, pain, tingling, infection, swelling, breast hardness, bleeding, organizing hematoma, failed reconstruction, breathing problems, thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism.<sup>28</sup> Postsurgical complications associated with oophorectomy/salpingo-oophorectomy included bleeding, pain, infection, and hematoma formation, with 1% to 3% of women in 1 study reporting such complications.<sup>142</sup> In another small study of women who were <em>BRCA1/2</em> mutation carriers, most women reported worsening vasomotor symptoms and decreased sexual function.<sup>146</sup> Seven studies reported psychological outcomes in women receiving risk-reducing mastectomy<sup>132-140</sup> and 3 studies in those receiving risk-reducing oophorectomy/salpingo-oophorectomy.<sup>143-145</sup> Commonly reported symptoms included reductions in body image, sexual activity/satisfaction, and general mental health (anxiety/depression symptoms); however, many of these symptoms were transient.<sup>28</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>For women whose family or personal history is associated with an increased risk for harmful mutations in the <em>BRCA1/2</em> genes, there is adequate evidence that the benefits of risk assessment, genetic counseling, genetic testing, and interventions are moderate. For women whose family history is not associated with an increased risk for harmful mutations in the <em>BRCA1/2</em> genes, there is adequate evidence that the benefits of risk assessment, genetic counseling, genetic testing, and interventions are small to none.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the overall harms of risk assessment, genetic counseling, genetic testing, and interventions are small to moderate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For women whose family history is associated with an increased risk for harmful mutations in the <em>BRCA1/2</em> genes, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the net benefit outweighs the harm of risk assessment and referral to genetic counseling for consideration of testing, detection, and intervention is moderate. For women whose family history is not associated with an increased risk for harmful mutations in the <em>BRCA1/2</em> genes, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the harms of risk assessment and referral to genetic counseling for consideration of testing, detection, and intervention outweigh the benefits.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">How Does the Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The <em>BRCA1</em> and <em>BRCA2</em> genes are tumor suppressor genes. Harmful mutations of these genes have been linked to hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. Risks for breast, ovarian, and other types of <em>BRCA</em>-related cancer are greatly increased in patients who have inherited potentially harmful <em>BRCA1/2</em> mutations. Genetic testing may identify these mutations. Several options are available to reduce cancer risk in patients found to be mutation carriers.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A draft version of this Recommendation Statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from February 19 through March 18, 2019. In response to public comments, the USPSTF clarified language regarding risk assessment and included additional information on the risk assessment tools referenced in the recommendation. It also incorporated language clarifying that the recommendation includes women with a personal history of <em>BRCA</em>-related cancer who have completed treatment and are considered cured.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Comments requested that the population under consideration be expanded to include other <em>BRCA</em>-associated cancers such as pancreatic cancer, melanoma, and prostate cancer, as well as men with breast or prostate cancer. The USPSTF recognizes the association of <em>BRCA1/2</em> mutations with cancers such as pancreatic, prostate, and melanoma. However, the scope of the recommendation is limited to the prevention of breast, ovarian, tubal, and peritoneal cancer because the net benefit demonstrated was in the prevention of these cancers. The USPSTF did not review evidence on the benefits or harms of risk assessment, genetic counseling, and genetic testing in men.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several comments requested changes to the recommendation related to newer genetic testing options. This includes the use of multigene panels, expanding the recommendation to include other gene mutations linked to increased risk of cancer (eg, <em>TP53, ATM, PALB2</em>), and the use of direct-to-consumer testing. The USPSTF acknowledges that there is increasing access to multigene panels; however, the clinical significance of identifying pathogenic variants in multigene panels requires further investigation. The evidence is currently limited on other moderate penetrance genes, given their relatively low incidence in the population. The USPSTF&rsquo;s recommendation focuses on <em>BRCA1/2</em> mutations because they are more prevalent and the findings are clinically actionable. The USPSTF found no evidence on the benefits or harms associated with the use of direct-to-consumer testing. Current National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines recommend that multigene testing be offered in the context of professional genetic expertise for pretest and posttest.<sup>29</sup> The USPSTF added language emphasizing that the net benefit relies on genetic counseling to accompany testing results, including results from direct-to-consumer testing.</p><h2>Table 1.

However, these risk assessment tools perform modestly at best in discriminating between individual women who will or will not develop breast cancer over time. Overall, the USPSTF determined that the net benefit of taking medications to reduce risk of breast cancer is larger in women who have a greater risk for developing breast cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Potential Benefits of Risk-Reducing Medications</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found convincing evidence that risk-reducing medications (tamoxifen, raloxifene, or aromatase inhibitors) provide at least a moderate benefit in reducing risk for invasive estrogen receptor (ER)&ndash;positive breast cancer in postmenopausal women at increased risk for breast cancer (<a href=\"#tab\">Table</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both tamoxifen and raloxifene can reduce risk of some types of skeletal fractures, independent from the risk of breast cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found that the benefits of taking tamoxifen, raloxifene, and aromatase inhibitors to reduce risk for breast cancer are no greater than small in women not at increased risk for the disease.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Potential Harms of Risk-Reducing Medications</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found convincing evidence that tamoxifen and raloxifene are associated with small to moderate harms. Tamoxifen and raloxifene increase risk for venous thromboembolic events (VTEs); tamoxifen increases risk more than raloxifene (<a href=\"#tab\">Table</a>), and the potential for harms are greater in older women than in younger women. The USPSTF also found adequate evidence that tamoxifen, but not raloxifene, increases risk for endometrial cancer in women with a uterus. Tamoxifen also increases risk of cataracts. Vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes) are a common adverse effect of both medications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the harms of aromatase inhibitors are also small to moderate. These harms include vasomotor symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, musculoskeletal pain, and possible cardiovascular events, such as stroke. Aromatase inhibitors do not reduce, and may even increase, risk of fractures.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">USPSTF Assessment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that there is a moderate net benefit from taking tamoxifen, raloxifene, or aromatase inhibitors to reduce risk of invasive breast cancer in women at increased risk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the potential harms of taking tamoxifen, raloxifene, and aromatase inhibitors to reduce risk of breast cancer outweigh the potential benefits in women not at increased risk for the disease.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinicians should discuss the limitations of current clinical risk assessment tools for predicting an individual&rsquo;s future risk of breast cancer when discussing the benefits and harms of risk-reducing medications with women.</p><h2>Table.

This recommendation does not apply to women who have a current or previous diagnosis of breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Assessment of Risk for Breast Cancer</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Various methods are available to identify women at increased risk for breast cancer, including formal clinical risk assessment tools or assessing breast cancer risk factors without using a formal tool.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Numerous risk assessment tools, such as the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool,<sup>5</sup> estimate a woman&rsquo;s risk of developing breast cancer over the next 5 years. There is no single cutoff for defining increased risk for all women. Women at greater risk, such as those with at least a 3% risk for breast cancer in the next 5 years, are likely to derive more benefit than harm from risk-reducing medications<sup>6</sup> and should be offered these medications if their risk of harms is low. Some women at lower risk for breast cancer have also been included in trials documenting reduced risk for breast cancer when taking tamoxifen, raloxifene, or aromatase inhibitors.<sup>3,4</sup> However, when balancing the harms associated with these medications, the net benefit will be lower among women at lower risk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alternatively, clinicians may use combinations of risk factors (including some risk factors not included in risk assessment tools but that would have permitted enrollment in some of the risk reduction trials) to identify women at increased risk. Some examples of combinations of multiple risk factors in women at increased risk include (but are not limited to) age 65 years or older with 1 first-degree relative with breast cancer; 45 years or older with more than 1 first-degree relative with breast cancer or 1 first-degree relative who developed breast cancer before age 50 years; 40 years or older with a first-degree relative with bilateral breast cancer; presence of atypical ductal or lobular hyperplasia or lobular carcinoma in situ on a prior biopsy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Women with documented pathogenic mutations in the breast cancer susceptibility 1 and 2 genes (<em>BRCA1/2</em>) and women with a history of chest radiation therapy (such as for treatment of childhood or adolescent Hodgkin or non-Hodgkin lymphoma) are at especially high risk for breast cancer. The cumulative absolute risk of developing breast cancer in a woman who received chest radiation at age 25 years increases from an estimated 1.4% at age 35 years to an estimated 29% by age 55 years,<sup>7</sup> although this may vary by treatment regimen. Women who carry a <em>BRCA1</em> mutation have a cumulative risk for breast cancer of 72% by age 80 years; women who carry a <em>BRCA2</em> mutation have a 69% cumulative risk<sup>8</sup> (compared with a 12% lifetime risk in the general population<sup>9</sup>). Women who carry the <em>BRCA1</em> mutation tend to develop estrogen receptor (ER)&ndash;negative breast cancer,<sup>10</sup> while women who carry the <em>BRCA2</em> mutation tend to develop ER-positive breast cancer. However, the USPSTF was not able to find sufficient evidence on the benefits and harms of risk-reducing medications in women with <em>BRCA1/2</em> gene mutations or women with a history of chest radiation, and the comprehensive management of these risk factors is beyond the scope of this Recommendation Statement. Further information on comprehensive management strategies, including risk-reducing medications, for women with these conditions is available from other organizations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Women not at increased risk for breast cancer, such as women younger than 60 years with no additional risk factors for breast cancer, or women with a low 5-year risk of breast cancer should not be routinely offered medications to reduce risk of breast cancer, since the risk of harms from these medications likely outweighs their potential benefit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although evidence on the best interval at which to reassess risk and indications for risk-reducing medications is not available, a pragmatic approach would be to repeat risk assessment when there is a significant change in breast cancer risk factors, for instance when a family member is diagnosed with breast cancer or when there is a new diagnosis of atypical hyperplasia or lobular carcinoma in situ on breast biopsy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When considering prescribing breast cancer risk-reducing medications, potential benefit of risk reduction of breast cancer must be balanced against the potential harms of adverse medication effects. See below for more information on potential harms from risk-reducing medications.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Risk-Reducing Medications</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A systematic review of trials conducted for the USPSTF found that compared with placebo, tamoxifen reduced the incidence of invasive breast cancer by 7 events per 1000 women over 5 years (95% CI, 4-12), and raloxifene reduced incidence by 9 events (95% CI, 3-15) per 1000 women over 5 years.<sup>3,4</sup> Given that the study participants in tamoxifen vs placebo and raloxifene vs placebo trials differed with respect to breast cancer risk and age, direct comparisons of effectiveness between tamoxifen and raloxifene cannot be made based on these placebo-controlled trials. However, the large Study of Tamoxifen and Raloxifene (STAR) trial, which directly compared tamoxifen with raloxifene, found that tamoxifen reduced breast cancer risk more than raloxifene after long-term follow-up<sup>3</sup> (<a href=\"#tab\">Table</a>). For women with a predicted 5-year breast cancer risk of 3% or greater, the absolute benefits are likely even higher. Tamoxifen and raloxifene have been found to reduce risk for nonvertebral and vertebral fractures, respectively.<sup>3</sup> However, use of tamoxifen and raloxifene is also associated with increased risk for VTEs and vasomotor symptoms. Tamoxifen also increases the risk for endometrial cancer and cataracts. These risks are increased in older women, although women who have had a hysterectomy are not at risk for endometrial cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aromatase inhibitors were found to reduce the incidence of invasive breast cancer by 16 events per 1000 women over 5 years (<a href=\"#tab\">Table</a>).<sup>3</sup> As with tamoxifen and raloxifene, these absolute benefits are likely even higher for women with a predicted breast cancer risk of 3% or greater. Harms of aromatase inhibitors include vasomotor symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, and musculoskeletal pain. Data on harms of aromatase inhibitors for the primary risk reduction of breast cancer are limited, especially long-term harms. A trend toward increased cardiovascular events (such as transient ischemic attack and cerebrovascular accident) has been observed in some aromatase inhibitor trials for treatment of women with early-stage breast cancer (or DCIS).<sup>3,11,12</sup> Younger women with no risk factors for cardiovascular disease are less likely to have a cardiovascular event with aromatase inhibitor treatment. Aromatase inhibitors do not reduce, and may even increase, risk of fractures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tamoxifen, raloxifene, and aromatase inhibitors all reduce primary breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women. Use of raloxifene and aromatase inhibitors is indicated only in postmenopausal women; only tamoxifen is indicated for risk-reduction of primary breast cancer in premenopausal women.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Duration of Medication Use and Persistence of Effects</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In trials, participants typically used risk-reducing medications for 3 to 5 years.<sup>3</sup> Benefits of tamoxifen have been found to persist up to 8 years beyond discontinuation,<sup>13,14</sup> whereas risk for VTEs and endometrial cancer return to baseline after discontinuation of tamoxifen.<sup>15</sup> Data on similarly long-term persistence of effects are not available for raloxifene or aromatase inhibitors.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Additional Approaches to Prevention</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF has made recommendations on screening for breast cancer<sup>16</sup> and for risk assessment, genetic counseling, and genetic testing for <em>BRCA</em> genetic mutations.<sup>17</sup> The NCI and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provide information about potential ways to reduce risk of cancer, including lifestyle and diet changes.<sup>18,19</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Useful Resources</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF does not endorse any particular risk prediction tool. However, the NCI Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool<sup>5</sup> and the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium Risk Calculator<sup>20</sup> are based on models tested in US populations and are publicly available for clinicians and patients to use as part of the process of shared, informed decision-making about taking risk-reducing medications for breast cancer. Both tools have been calibrated in US populations, but their discriminatory accuracy of predicting which women will develop breast cancer may be more limited and there is no single cutoff for defining increased risk for all women.</p><h2>Other Considerations</h2><h3 align=\"left\">Implementation</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Prescribing risk-reducing medications for breast cancer is an uncommon practice among primary care clinicians. Based on limited survey data, 10% to 30% (depending on medication type) of primary care clinicians report ever prescribing risk-reducing medications for primary prevention of breast cancer, and most have only done so a few times.<sup>21-23</sup> The reported use of risk-reducing medications among women is also relatively low; 1 meta-analysis of 26 studies found that overall, 16.3% of women at increased risk for breast cancer used risk-reducing medications.<sup>24</sup> Although only exploratory, a number of studies have suggested that even women who are well informed about the risks and benefits have relatively little interest in taking risk-reducing medications for breast cancer and are primarily concerned with potential harms.<sup>25-29</sup> When considering prescribing risk-reducing medications for breast cancer, clinicians should discuss each woman&rsquo;s personal values and preferences with respect to breast cancer risk reduction, in addition to what is known about her personal risk for breast cancer and the potential benefits and harms of medications.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>More research is needed to better identify which individual women at increased risk for breast cancer could best benefit from risk-reducing medications. In particular, studies are needed that evaluate how medications may reduce breast cancer risk in women who are carriers of pathogenic <em>BRCA1</em> or <em>BRCA2</em> mutations. Additionally, given the higher breast cancer mortality rates in African American women, studies that include sufficient numbers of African American women are needed to better understand how medications may reduce risk in these women. Although currently available risk assessment tools can identify the number of cases of breast cancer expected to arise in a given population, better tools for predicting breast cancer risk in individual women are needed. Additionally, longer-term follow-up is needed for studies of raloxifene and aromatase inhibitors to better understand the persistence of both breast cancer risk reduction effects and potential harms from the medications. Longer-term data on harms of aromatase inhibitors for the risk reduction of primary breast cancer are also needed. This information could help clinicians weigh the benefits and harms of individual medications with their patients.</p><h2>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h2><p>This recommendations is consistent with the 2013 USPSTF recommendation.<sup>88</sup> As before, the USPSTF recommends offering risk-reducing medications to women at increased risk for breast cancer and at low risk for adverse medication effects (B recommendation) and recommends against routine use of risk-reducing medications in women not at increased risk (D recommendation). The current recommendation now includes aromatase inhibitors among medications that can reduce risk of breast cancer.</p>","other":"<h2>Recommendations of Others</h2><p>In 2013, the American Society of Clinical Oncology recommended discussing tamoxifen as an option to reduce risk of breast cancer in women at increased risk who are 35 years and older. It also recommended that raloxifene and exemestane be discussed as additional options for risk reduction in postmenopausal women.<sup>89</sup> The National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommends risk-reducing agents for women 35 years and older and tamoxifen for premenopausal women only; tamoxifen, raloxifene, anastrozole, or exemestane may be used in postmenopausal women.<sup>90</sup> The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists states that the risk-reduction agents tamoxifen and raloxifene (in postmenopausal women) may be considered for breast cancer risk reduction in <em>BRCA</em> mutation carriers.<sup>91</sup> Given the protective effects in other at-risk populations, aromatase inhibitors may be an alternative for women who cannot take tamoxifen.<sup>91</sup> Postmenopausal women taking tamoxifen should be closely monitored for symptoms of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer.<sup>92</sup> The American Academy of Family Physicians supports the 2013 USPSTF recommendation.<sup>93</sup> The American Cancer Society does not have formal recommendations on the use of risk-reducing medications for breast cancer.</p>","discussion":"<h2>Discussion</h2><h3 align=\"left\">Burden of Disease</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Breast cancer is the most common nonskin cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death in women.<sup>2</sup> In 2018, an estimated 266,120 new cases of breast cancer were diagnosed in women in the United States, representing 30% of all new cancer cases in women.<sup>2</sup> An estimated 40,920 women in the United States died of breast cancer, representing 14% of all cancer deaths in women.<sup>2</sup> Based on data from 2008 to 2014, the 5-year survival rate of breast cancer is an estimated 89.7%, ranging from 98.7% when cancer is diagnosed at localized stages to 27% when diagnosis occurs in the context of distant metastases.<sup>1</sup> Although incidence rates are similar among white and African American women (128.6 vs 126.9 cases per 100,000 persons, respectively), mortality rates are higher among African American women (28.7 deaths per 100,000 African American persons vs 20.3&nbsp;deaths per 100,000 white persons).<sup>1</sup> Incidence rates have increased among Asian/Pacific Islander, non-Hispanic African American, and Hispanic women but have remained stable among non-Hispanic white and American Indian/Alaskan Native women.<sup>9</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Scope of Review</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed evidence on the accuracy of risk assessment methods to identify women who could benefit from risk-reducing medications for breast cancer, as well as evidence on the effectiveness, adverse effects, and subgroup variations of these medications (specifically, the selective ER modulators tamoxifen and raloxifene and the aromatase inhibitors exemestane and anastrozole).<sup>3,4</sup> The USPSTF reviewed evidence from randomized trials, observational studies, and diagnostic accuracy studies of risk stratification models in women without preexisting breast cancer or DCIS. Studies that included women with pathogenic <em>BRCA1/2</em> genetic mutations were included in the review criteria; however, studies to understand the benefits and harms in this population were limited.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Effectiveness of Risk Assessment Models</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed evidence from 25 good- and fair-quality studies on 18 risk stratification models (n &gt;5,000,000).<sup>3,4</sup> Models reviewed included the Gail,<sup>30-36</sup> Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium,<sup>37-39</sup> Rosner-Colditz,<sup>40-43</sup> Tyrer-Cuzick,<sup>44-47</sup> Chlebowski,<sup>48</sup> and Italian<sup>49-51</sup> models, as well as variations of these models that focus on specific subpopulations or that include newer data on breast density or benign breast disease.<sup>3</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The original Gail model, the first model used clinically, includes age, age at first menstruation, age at first childbirth, family history of breast cancer in first-degree relatives, number of prior breast biopsies, and history of atypical hyperplasia.<sup>30</sup> The current version of the Gail model is used in the Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool, which is publicly accessible through the NCI website.<sup>5</sup> Expanding on the Gail model, newer models include race/ethnicity, prior false-positive mammography results or benign breast disease, body mass index or height, estrogen and progestin use, history of breastfeeding, menopause status or age, smoking, alcohol use, physical activity, education, breast density, and diet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several models have been tested in large US populations in good-quality studies that reported only low to modest accuracy. The Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium model was derived from more than 11,638 breast cancer cases that developed among a cohort of almost 2.4 million women.<sup>38</sup> The Rosner-Colditz model was derived from 1761 breast cancer cases that developed among 58,520 participants in the Nurses&rsquo; Health Study.<sup>40</sup> Chlebowski and colleagues<sup>48</sup> developed a model based on 3236 cases that developed in the Women&rsquo;s Health Initiative study. Models from Italy<sup>49-51</sup> and the United Kingdom<sup>44-47</sup> were also based on large populations but were not tested in the United States. Although these models demonstrate good calibration for predicting risk in a population (ie, the predicted number of breast cancer cases expected to arise in a population closely matched the observed number of cases), their discriminatory accuracy to correctly classify individual women who will develop breast cancer over the next 5 years from those who will not is modest at best; the C statistic for most models ranged from 0.55 to 0.65.<sup>3</sup> Models that include breast density, postmenopausal hormone use, and a more extensive family history minimally improve predictive estimates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most models report performance slightly better than age alone as a risk predictor. No studies evaluated optimal ages or frequencies for risk assessment.<sup>3</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Effectiveness of Risk-Reducing Medications</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed evidence from 10 trials that evaluated the effect of risk-reducing medications for breast cancer.<sup>3,4</sup> Four trials (n = 28,193) evaluated tamoxifen in premenopausal and postmenopausal women at increased risk for breast cancer<sup>13-15,52-60</sup> (in 1 additional trial of low-dose tamoxifen in postmenopausal women not at increased risk for breast cancer,<sup>61</sup> the low dose was not found to reduce risk of breast cancer and so was not considered further by the USPSTF); 2 trials (n = 17,806) evaluated raloxifene in postmenopausal women not at increased risk for breast cancer,<sup>62-78</sup> 1 trial (n = 19,747) directly compared raloxifene with tamoxifen in postmenopausal women at increased risk for breast cancer (STAR trial<sup>79-81</sup>), and 2 trials evaluated aromatase inhibitors (examestane<sup>82,83</sup> [n = 4560] and anastrozole<sup>84-86</sup> [n = 3864]) in postmenopausal women at increased risk for breast cancer. Each of the studies that targeted women at increased risk for breast cancer used different combinations of risk criteria, such as age, family history, previous abnormal but benign breast pathology, or predicted breast cancer risk as estimated by a risk tool (most commonly &gt;1.66% 5-year predicted risk of breast cancer, as calculated by the Gail model) to recruit participants. Women in the raloxifene trials were older (median age, 67-67.5 years)<sup>3</sup> than women in the other trials, given that these trials targeted postmenopausal women not at increased risk for breast cancer (the primary aim was for outcomes other than breast cancer risk reduction). In contrast, women in the tamoxifen trials were slightly younger, given that these trials included premenopausal women (median age range, 47-53 years).<sup>3</sup> Most trials were multicenter and conducted in numerous sites across several countries, predominantly in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Europe. Most trial participants were white (84%-97% white in studies that reported this information).<sup>3</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In trials, all 3 types of medications reduced invasive and ER-positive breast cancer but not ER-negative breast cancer.<sup>3</sup> Using pooled results of the placebo-controlled trials and projecting benefits over 5 years, the use of tamoxifen would result in 7 fewer cases of invasive breast cancer (risk ratio [RR], 0.69 [95% CI, 0.59-0.84]) and 8 fewer cases of ER-positive breast cancer (RR, 0.58 [95% CI, 0.42-0.81]) (unless otherwise stated, all numbers of cases are per 1000 women over 5 years of medication use).<sup>3</sup> Raloxifene use would result in 9 fewer cases of invasive breast cancer (RR, 0.44 [95% CI, 0.24-0.80]) and 8 fewer cases of ER-positive breast cancer (RR, 0.33 [95% CI, 0.15-0.73]).<sup>3</sup> Furthermore, in addition to reducing breast cancer risk, tamoxifen and raloxifene were also found to reduce risk for fractures: 3 fewer cases of nonvertebral fractures with tamoxifen (RR, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.45-0.98]) and 7 fewer cases of vertebral fractures with raloxifene (RR, 0.61 [95% CI, 0.53-0.70]).<sup>3</sup> Aromatase inhibitors would result in 16 fewer cases of invasive breast cancer (RR, 0.45 [95% CI, 0.26-0.70]) and 15 fewer cases of ER-positive breast cancer (RR, 0.37 [95% CI, 0.19-0.63]).<sup>3</sup> Risk reduction of both invasive and ER-positive breast cancer persisted up to 8 years after discontinuation of tamoxifen use in 2 trials<sup>14,15</sup> (data on similar length of long-term follow-up for raloxifene and aromatase inhibitors are not currently available). Effectiveness of medications (within trials) did not vary by age or menopausal status. One trial of tamoxifen<sup>60</sup> and 1 of anastrazole<sup>84</sup> found that risk reduction was greater for women with a history of breast abnormalities on biopsy, such as atypical hyperplasia or lobular carcinoma in situ. Most trials that reported on subpopulation results by 5-year predicted risk category (as determined by the Gail model) showed risk reduction across all risk categories,<sup>3,60,78,80,83</sup> and 1 study of tamoxifen also indicated that risk reduction may be greatest in the highest-risk groups.<sup>3,60</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although comparisons of effectiveness between the 3 medication types (tamoxifen, raloxifene, and aromatase inhibitors) cannot be made because of the different participant characteristics among the placebo-controlled trials, the large STAR trial directly compared tamoxifen with raloxifene for breast cancer risk reduction and found that tamoxifen provided a greater risk reduction for invasive breast cancer on long-term follow-up (5 fewer cases [95% CI, 1-9]).<sup>3</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Potential Harms of Risk Assessment and Risk-Reducing Medications</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The same 10 trials described above that reported on benefits of risk-reducing medications for breast cancer also reported harms.<sup>3,4</sup> When compared with placebo, tamoxifen was associated with 5 more cases of VTEs (RR, 1.93 [95% CI, 1.33-2.68]), 4 more cases of endometrial cancer (RR, 2.25 [95% CI, 1.17-4.41]), and 26 more cases of cataracts (RR, 1.22 [95% CI, 1.08-1.48]).<sup>3</sup> Vasomotor symptoms were also increased with tamoxifen use. No significant differences were found with tamoxifen use on rates of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, coronary heart disease (CHD) events, or stroke.<sup>3</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When compared with placebo, raloxifene was associated with 7 more cases of VTE (RR, 1.56 [95% CI, 1.11-2.60]).<sup>3</sup> Vasomotor symptoms were also increased with raloxifene use. No significant differences were found with raloxifene use on rates of CHD events, stroke, endometrial cancer, or cataracts. Based on the STAR trial, more harms were reported with tamoxifen compared with raloxifene: 4 more cases of VTE (95% CI, 1-7), 3 more cases of deep vein thrombosis (95% CI, 1-5), 5 more cases of endometrial cancer (95% CI, 2-9), and 15 more cases of cataracts (95% CI, 8-22) with tamoxifen than with raloxifene.<sup>3</sup> Both aromatase inhibitor trials reported more vasomotor and musculoskeletal symptoms with aromatase inhibitors compared with placebo.<sup>3,82-84</sup> No significant differences in rates of VTEs, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, CHD events, stroke, endometrial cancer, or cataracts were reported for aromatase inhibitors;<sup>3,82-84</sup>&nbsp;however, primary prevention studies were likely underpowered to detect any differences in these outcomes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other studies have evaluated the use of aromatase inhibitors for indications other than risk reduction of primary breast cancer. A recent meta-analysis of trials that evaluated extended aromatase inhibitor use for adjuvant treatment in women with early-stage ER-positive breast cancer suggests a potential increase in cardiovascular disease events (odds ratio [OR], 1.18 [95% CI, 1.00-1.40]; 7 studies; n = 16,349) with aromatase inhibitors compared with placebo or no treatment.<sup>12</sup> Another study that compared anastrozole with tamoxifen in treating women with DCIS found a significant increase in cerebrovascular events (OR, 3.36 [95% CI, 1.04-14.18]) and a nonsignificant increase in transient ischemic attacks (OR, 2.69 [95% CI, 0.90-9.65]) with anastrozole.<sup>11</sup> Another meta-analysis that evaluated studies of aromatase inhibitors compared with tamoxifen for treatment of early-stage breast cancer found no difference in VTEs, cerebrovascular events, or coronary artery disease events.<sup>87</sup> Literature from these other studies also suggest that aromatase inhibitors may increase the risk of fractures. Compared with tamoxifen (which reduces risk of fractures), more fractures were seen with aromatase inhibitors.<sup>11,87</sup> The meta-analysis that evaluated extended use of aromatase inhibitors compared with placebo or no treatment also found increased fractures associated with aromatase inhibitors (OR, 1.34 [95% CI, 1.16-1.55]); however, some of the participants who received placebo or no treatment in the extended treatment period may have received tamoxifen or raloxifene during the initial treatment period.<sup>12</sup> Given that these studies focused on treatment of women with breast cancer or DCIS and were often conducted in comparison with tamoxifen rather than placebo, it is unclear whether these findings are generalizable to a primary prevention population.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether risk-reducing medications provide a net benefit depends on a woman&rsquo;s risk for breast cancer, balanced with the potential for harms from the medications. Accordingly, the USPSTF recommendation for women at low risk for breast cancer is different than its recommendation for women at increased risk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For women at increased risk for breast cancer, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that taking medications to reduce risk for breast cancer confer a moderate net benefit. Tamoxifen is associated with a greater risk reduction of breast cancer compared with raloxifene but also with a greater risk of endometrial cancer (in women with a uterus), cataracts, and VTEs. These risks increase with age. Both tamoxifen and raloxifene decrease risk of fractures but increase risk of vasomotor symptoms. Aromatase inhibitors also decrease risk of breast cancer in women at increased risk for the disease. No studies are currently available that compare aromatase inhibitors with tamoxifen or raloxifene for risk reduction of primary breast cancer. Some trials of aromatase inhibitors used for the treatment of women with early-stage breast cancer or DCIS suggest that there may be a small increase in cardiovascular disease, such as stroke, with aromatase inhibitors; compared with tamoxifen, which reduces risk of fractures, aromatase inhibitors increase risk of fractures. Whether aromatase inhibitors increase risk of fractures compared with placebo or no treatment is unclear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For women not at increased risk for breast cancer, the USPSTF found that tamoxifen, raloxifene, and aromatase inhibitors provide only a small benefit in reducing risk for breast cancer but are associated with moderate harms. Overall, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the potential harms of tamoxifen, raloxifene, and aromatase inhibitors outweigh the potential benefits in women at low risk of breast cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from January 15 to February 11, 2019. In response to comments received, the USPSTF has clarified that the recommendation statement does not list every scenario in which medications could be considered but rather provides information on risk factors that clinicians could consider in assessing breast cancer risk with their patients. Some examples are provided to help clinicians understand how to consider these risk factors, but these examples should not be interpreted as a definitive list. Some comments expressed concern that the USPSTF was recommending risk-reducing medications at a lower 5-year breast cancer risk threshold than previously. The USPSTF has not lowered its risk threshold for which it has found a net benefit with risk-reducing medications. Instead, the current recommendation acknowledges the uncertainty around relying on a specific threshold calculated by risk assessment tools to identify women who may benefit from risk-reducing medications and offers an alternative approach to risk assessment of women, which includes clinician consideration of clinical risk factors. Some comments also expressed concern that the USPSTF was no longer recommending &ldquo;shared, informed decision making.&rdquo; As with all of its recommendations, the USPSTF encourages clinicians to discuss with patients the risks and benefits of clinical preventive services in the context of each individual&rsquo;s personal health values and preferences when considering a service. Language clarifying this has been added to the Clinical Considerations section. Last, as requested, additional information is provided on selection of medications and menopausal status, and information on harms of aromatase inhibitors has been clarified in the Clinical Considerations section.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Tamoxifen and raloxifene are selective ER modulators that inhibit ERs in breast tissue and reduce risk for ER-positive breast cancer by blocking the proliferation of estrogen-sensitive epithelial cells where breast cancer can develop. These medications have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for risk reduction of breast cancer. Aromatase inhibitors inhibit conversion of androgen to estrogen and can reduce risk of ER-positive breast cancer by decreasing the amount of estrogen available to bind to estrogen-sensitive epithelial cells. Aromatase inhibitors have been evaluated for risk reduction of breast cancer in clinical trials, although they are primarily used for treatment rather than risk reduction of primary cancer. Aromatase inhibitors are not currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for risk reduction of primary breast cancer.</p>","topic":"Breast Cancer: Medication Use to Reduce Risk","keywords":"breast cancer|risk reduction|chemoprevention|tamoxifen|raloxifene|aromatase inhibitor|exemestane|anastrozole|Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulator (SERM)|estrogen receptor|ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)|lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS)|endometrial cancer|thromboembolism|BRCA","pubDate":"2019-09-03","categories":["3"],"tool":["218","221","220","219"]},"415":{"topicType":"Screening","topicYear":2019,"uspstfAlias":"pancreatic-cancer-screening","specific":[504],"title":"Pancreatic Cancer: Screening","rationale":"<h2>Rationale</h2><h3>Importance</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (referred to hereafter as pancreatic&nbsp;cancer) is an uncommon cancer with an age-adjusted&nbsp;annual incidence of 12.9 cases per 100,000 person-years. However,&nbsp;the death rate is 11.0 deaths per 100,000 person-years&nbsp;because the prognosis of pancreatic cancer is&nbsp; poor.<sup>1</sup> Although its&nbsp;incidence is low, pancreatic cancer is the third most common&nbsp;cause of cancer death in the United States. Based on data from&nbsp;the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program from&nbsp;2009 to 2015, the overall 5-year survival rate for pancreatic cancer&nbsp;is 9.3%, and survival rates vary depending on the stage at&nbsp;which it is diagnosed. The 5-year survival rate for localized pancreatic&nbsp;cancer is 37.4%; when regional disease is present, the&nbsp;5-year survival rate is 12.4%, and when distant metastatic disease&nbsp;is present, the 5-year survival rate is 2.9%.<sup>1</sup> Surgical intervention&nbsp;at an early stage is the treatment most likely to improve chances&nbsp;of survival; however, most cases of pancreatic cancer are&nbsp;detected at an advanced stage,<sup>1</sup> when surgical resection is not&nbsp;likely to be beneficial. Because of the increasing incidence of pancreatic&nbsp;cancer, along with improvements in early detection and&nbsp;treatment of other types of cancer, it is estimated that pancreatic&nbsp;cancer may soon become the second-leading cause of cancer&nbsp;death in the United States.<sup>2</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2019, an estimated 56,770 persons will be diagnosed with&nbsp;pancreatic cancer and 45,750 persons will die of the disease.<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;About 85% to 90% of persons diagnosed with pancreatic cancer&nbsp;do not have known familial risk or genetic syndromes, 5% to 10%&nbsp;of persons have familial risk, and 3% to 5% of cases are due to&nbsp;inherited genetic cancer syndromes (such as Peutz-Jeghers syndrome).&nbsp;Familial pancreatic cancer is defined as a kindred with at&nbsp;least 2 affected first-degree relatives; a person&rsquo;s degree of familial&nbsp;risk depends on the number of affected relatives.<sup>3-5</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Reaffirmation Process</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2004, the USPSTF reviewed the evidence on screening for pancreatic cancer in asymptomatic adults and issued a D recommendation. The USPSTF decided to use a reaffirmation deliberation process to update this recommendation. The USPSTF uses the reaffirmation process for existing A or D grade recommendations for which only a very high level of evidence would justify a change in the grade of the recommendation. In its deliberation of the evidence, the USPSTF considers whether the new evidence is of sufficient strength and quality to change its previous conclusions about the evidence.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Detection</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no evidence on the accuracy of imaging-based screening tests (computed tomography [CT] scan, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], or endoscopic ultrasonography [EUS]) for detecting pancreatic cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Benefits of Detection and Early Treatment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no evidence that screening for pancreatic cancer or treatment of screen-detected pancreatic cancer improves disease-specific morbidity or mortality, or all-cause mortality. Based on the low incidence of pancreatic cancer in the general population, the uncertain accuracy of current candidate screening tests, and the poor prognosis for pancreatic cancer even when treated at an early stage, the USPSTF found adequate evidence to bound the benefits of screening for pancreatic cancer in asymptomatic adults as no greater than small. When direct evidence is limited, absent, or restricted to select populations or clinical scenarios, the USPSTF may place conceptual upper or lower bounds on the magnitude of benefit or harms.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Harms of Detection and Early Treatment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate indirect evidence to bound the magnitude of the harms of screening for pancreatic cancer and treatment of screen-detected pancreatic cancer as at least moderate, based on potential harms from false-positive results and the harms of treatment.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Using a reaffirmation deliberation process, the USPSTF concludes that there is no new evidence that warrants a change in the prior D recommendation and reaffirms its previous conclusion that the potential benefits of screening for pancreatic cancer in asymptomatic adults do not outweigh the potential harms.</p>","clinical":"<h2>Clinical Considerations</h2><h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This recommendation applies to asymptomatic adults not known to be at high risk of pancreatic cancer. Therefore, this recommendation does not apply to persons at high risk of pancreatic cancer due to an inherited genetic syndrome (eg, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, hereditary pancreatitis) or due to a history of familial pancreatic cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Persons with certain inherited genetic syndromes or a history of familial pancreatic cancer are at high risk of pancreatic cancer. This recommendation does not apply to these high-risk populations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other factors such as new-onset diabetes, preexisting diabetes, older age, cigarette smoking, obesity, or a history of chronic pancreatitis increase risk to a lesser degree. The USPSTF considers asymptomatic persons who have these other risk factors part of the general population, and they are included in this recommendation.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF does not recommend screening for pancreatic cancer in the general population using any method. Imaging-based methods, such as the CT scan, MRI, and EUS, have been studied as screening tests in trials of screening persons at high risk of pancreatic cancer due to inherited genetic syndromes or familial pancreatic cancer. There currently are no accurate, validated biomarkers for early detection of pancreatic cancer.<sup>6-11</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Treatment or Interventions</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Surgery (pancreaticoduodenectomy [known as the Whipple procedure] or total or distal pancreatectomy) is the generally recommended treatment for pancreatic cancer deemed to be resectable at the time of diagnosis. Neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy may be recommended, depending on the stage of cancer and other factors.</p><h2>Other Considerations</h2><h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Research is needed to develop effective screening tests with high sensitivity and high specificity for pancreatic cancer and, ideally, high-grade precursor lesions. Research is needed to better understand the prevalence and natural history of precursor lesions to pancreatic cancer, including the likelihood of progression of precursor lesions to pancreatic cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Studies investigating the benefits and harms of screening for pancreatic cancer in persons at high risk because of a history of familial pancreatic cancer and inherited genetic syndromes are an active area of research. Continued research in this area is needed to identify effective screening strategies and to determine the benefits (ie, improved clinical outcomes) and harms of screening for pancreatic cancer in this population. If a net benefit of screening is found in high-risk persons, studies of screening in persons who may be at increased risk (eg, adults with new-onset diabetes) may be warranted. Research on improved risk stratification may also help advance the field of pancreatic cancer screening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, pancreatectomy carries a significant risk of morbidity and mortality, and the prognosis for more advanced pancreatic cancer, which is not amenable to surgery, is poor. Research on better treatments for all stages of pancreatic cancer to improve long-term survival and decrease the harms of treatment is needed.</p>","other":"<h2>Recommendations of Others</h2><p>No organization currently recommends screening for pancreatic cancer in the general population of asymptomatic adults. The American College of Gastroenterology conditionally recommends surveillance for pancreatic cancer in certain high-risk persons (eg, those with known genetic syndromes associated with pancreatic cancer and those from familial pancreatic cancer kindreds who have an affected first-degree relative) and suggests that surveillance should be performed in experienced centers, ideally under research conditions.<sup>38</sup></p>","discussion":"<h2>Discussion</h2><h3>Burden of Disease</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Pancreatic cancer is uncommon, with an estimated incidence of 12.9 cases per 100,000 person-years. It has a poor prognosis, with an overall 5-year survival rate of 9.3%.<sup>1</sup> Surgical intervention at an early stage is the treatment most likely to improve chances of survival; however, most cases of pancreatic cancer are detected at an advanced stage,<sup>1</sup> when surgery is not likely to improve the survival rate. In 2019, an estimated 56,770 persons will be diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, and 45,750 persons will die of it, making it the third most common cause of cancer death in the United States.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>To update its 2004 recommendation on screening for pancreatic cancer, the USPSTF commissioned a systematic review on the benefits and harms of screening for pancreatic cancer, the diagnostic accuracy of screening tests for pancreatic cancer, and the benefits and harms of treatment of screen-detected or asymptomatic pancreatic cancer.<sup>12,13</sup> The USPSTF considered studies of screening in persons at high risk of pancreatic cancer due to familial history to determine whether this evidence might help inform its recommendation on screening for pancreatic cancer in the general population.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening Tests</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no studies that reported on the sensitivity or specificity of CT scan, MRI, or EUS as screening tests for pancreatic cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found 13 cohort studies of screening for pancreatic cancer, mostly in persons at high familial risk, using CT scan, MRI, or EUS (n = 1317) that reported on the yield of screening.<sup>14-26</sup> One study also included screening in a group of 161 participants who did not have known familial or genetic risks and detected no cases of pancreatic cancer in this group.<sup>22</sup> Among high-risk participants in all studies, a total of 18 cases of pancreatic cancer were found across all rounds of screening, for a yield of 15.6 cases per 1000 persons.<sup>12,13</sup> The applicability of these data to persons not at high risk of pancreatic cancer is uncertain, and the yield of screening in a population with a lower incidence of pancreatic cancer is likely to be much lower. Another important consideration is that any screening test used in a population with a lower incidence of pancreatic cancer would potentially have a lower positive predictive value and a higher rate of false-positive results.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no studies on the benefits of screening for pancreatic cancer or on the benefits of treatment of screen-detected or asymptomatic pancreatic cancer in the general population.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 13 cohort studies of screening in persons at high familial risk, a total of 57 screened patients underwent pancreatic surgery. Of the 57 patients undergoing surgery, 14 were found to have pancreatic cancer, 38 had precursor lesions (intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm, pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia, or both), and 5 had neuroendocrine tumors, liver hyperplasia, or a benign serous cystadenoma.<sup>12</sup> Because the risk of progression of precursor lesions (particularly low-grade lesions) to invasive cancer is not clear, the balance of the potential benefits or harms of detecting and undergoing pancreatic surgery to remove such lesions is unknown. Pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia is common, and most cases do not progress to cancer. In 2 studies, 26% to 54% of pancreata removed at surgery for reasons other than pancreatic cancer contained such lesions.<sup>27,28</sup> Another retrospective study, describing the experience at 3 US cancer centers with surgical resection of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms,<sup>29</sup> found that the International Consensus Guidelines criteria for the management of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas<sup>30</sup> had high sensitivity (98.4%) but low specificity (14.8%) to predict high-grade dysplasia or invasive cancer. These data suggest the possibility that screening in the general population might lead to overdiagnosis and overtreatment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the screening studies of high-risk persons, a total of 18 cases of pancreatic cancer were detected. As noted above, 14 of these cases were confirmed by surgery. The remaining 4 cases were detected with advanced-stage nonresectable disease. Twelve of the cases (66.7%) were detected at stage I or II or were classified as &ldquo;resectable.&rdquo;<sup>12,13</sup>&nbsp;Of the 18 detected cases of pancreatic cancer, longer-term follow-up was reported for only 10. Among those 10 cases, 5 persons were alive at 12 to 63 months of follow-up, 2 of whom were reported to have distant metastases.<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;These data are limited by incomplete reporting of follow-up for detected cases and by the small number of cases. The USPSTF did not find studies that compared health outcomes for screened and unscreened populations to determine the effectiveness of screening. In addition, the applicability of these results to a population not at high risk is uncertain.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Potential Harms of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed 10 cohort studies of screening for pancreatic cancer in high-risk persons to assess the potential harms of screening and treatment. In 2 studies (n = 271) that assessed the psychosocial harms of screening, the majority of participants reported normal levels of distress or worry at all time points.<sup>31,32</sup> One study reported no change in levels of perceived pancreatic cancer risk, worry, and general distress at baseline and 3 months after screening,<sup>31</sup> while a second study reported Cancer Worry Scale scores that decreased over time (compared with baseline scores).<sup>32</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eight studies reported on procedure-related harms of screening.<sup>14,15,17-22</sup> In 1 study of 216 persons who underwent EUS, 55 (25.5%) reported mild postprocedure pain, and 13 (6.0%) reported adverse events related to anesthesia.<sup>22</sup> Of 150 persons in 2 studies who underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography as a diagnostic test, 15 (10.0%) developed acute pancreatitis, 9 of whom required hospitalization.<sup>21,22</sup> The remaining 6 studies identified no harms related to screening.<sup>14,15,17-20</sup> The prevalence of incidental findings was not consistently reported in the available studies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Six studies reported on the harms of surgery (n = 32 persons receiving surgery).<sup>14,17,18,20,22,33</sup> One study reported a stricture to the hepaticojejunal anastomosis in 1 patient 11 months after surgery and unspecified postoperative complications in another patient.<sup>14</sup> In another study, 2 cases of postoperative fistula and 3 cases of diabetes were reported.<sup>17</sup> Four studies reported no harms.<sup>18,20,22,33</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pancreatectomy carries a significant risk of morbidity and mortality, and additional data on the harms of surgery are available from studies not specifically conducted in screen-detected persons. A German study of 428 patients undergoing pancreatectomy (primarily pancreaticoduodenectomy) reported a 33.6% rate of any complication.<sup>34</sup> One 2003 US study reported a 4.6% rate of perioperative mortality after pancreatectomy for neoplastic disease,<sup>35</sup> and another US study of 21,482 pancreatectomies performed between 2007 and 2010 found a 3.7% 30-day mortality rate.<sup>36</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF considered the evidence using a reaffirmation process and found no new evidence on the benefits of screening for pancreatic cancer. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the magnitude of the harms of screening for pancreatic cancer and treatment of screen-detected pancreatic cancer can be bounded as at least moderate. Therefore, the USPSTF reaffirms its previous conclusion that the potential benefits of screening for pancreatic cancer in asymptomatic adults do not outweigh the potential harms.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from February 5 through March 4, 2019. In response to public comment, the USPSTF added information on survival rates for pancreatic cancer by stage. The USPSTF added information about the consensus guidelines for the management of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas, and the accuracy (ie, sensitivity and specificity) of those guidelines in predicting the presence of pancreatic cancer or high-grade dysplasia. The USPSTF also added data on longer-term follow-up of screening studies in persons at high familial risk of pancreatic cancer. A few comments requested that the USPSTF make a recommendation on screening in persons with a history of familial pancreatic cancer or persons with an inherited genetic syndrome known to be associated with high risk of pancreatic cancer. In response, the USPSTF wants to clarify that these groups are outside the scope of this recommendation and that this recommendation does not apply to these persons.</p>","topic":"Pancreatic Cancer: Screening","keywords":"pancreatic cancer|screening|cancer|adult","pubDate":"2019-08-06","categories":["3"],"tool":["222","224","223"]},"417":{"topicType":"Counseling","topicYear":2020,"uspstfAlias":"tobacco-and-nicotine-use-prevention-in-children-and-adolescents-primary-care-interventions","specific":[585,586],"title":"Tobacco Use in Children and Adolescents: Primary Care Interventions","rationale":"<h2>Importance</h2><p>Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable death in the US.<sup>1</sup> An estimated annual 480,000 deaths are attributable to tobacco use in adults, including secondhand smoke.<sup>1</sup> It is estimated that every day about 1600 youth aged 12 to 17 years smoke their first cigarette<sup>2</sup> and that about 5.6 million adolescents alive today will die prematurely of a smoking-related illness.<sup>1,3</sup> Although conventional cigarette use has gradually declined among children in the US since the late 1990s,<sup>4</sup> tobacco use via electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) is quickly rising and is now more common among youth than cigarette smoking. e-Cigarette sales in the US market have risen rapidly since 2007,<sup>5</sup> and e-cigarette use by youth has been tracked in the National Youth Tobacco Survey since 2011.<sup>1</sup> From 2011 to 2019, current e-cigarette use increased from 1.5% to 27.5% among high school students<sup>6,7</sup> (from an estimated 220,000 to 4.11 million students); in 2019, 5.8% of high school students (an estimated 860,000 students) used conventional cigarettes.<sup>7</sup></p>\r\n<p>e-Cigarette products usually contain nicotine,<sup>8</sup> which is addictive, raising concerns about e-cigarette use and nicotine addiction in children.<sup>5</sup> Evidence suggests an association between e-cigarette use in nonsmoking adolescents and subsequent cigarette smoking in young adults. Ever use of e-cigarettes is associated with increased risk of ever use of combustible tobacco products.<sup>9</sup> In addition, as the degree of e-cigarette use increases, frequency and intensity of smoking cigarettes also increases.<sup>9</sup> Exposure to nicotine during adolescence can harm the developing brain, which may affect brain function and cognition, attention, and mood;<sup>1,5,10,11</sup> thus, minimizing nicotine exposure from any tobacco product in youth is important. In 2019, an outbreak of e-cigarette, or vaping, product use&ndash;associated lung injury (EVALI) occurred in the US; approximately 15% of patients hospitalized with EVALI were younger than 18 years.<sup>12</sup> Vitamin E acetate, an additive to some tetrahydrocannabinol-containing e-cigarettes, was found to be strongly linked to the outbreak.<sup>12</sup> Other tobacco products high school students report using include cigars, cigarillos, and little cigars (7.6%); smokeless tobacco (4.8%); hookahs (3.4%); and pipe tobacco (1.1%).<sup>7</sup> In 2019, cigar use (including cigarillos and little cigars) surpassed cigarette use in high school students.<sup>7</sup> See the Definitions section for more information on tobacco products and terminology used in this US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation.</p><h2>USPSTF Assessment of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h2><p>Available evidence on interventions to prevent and help youth quit tobacco use almost exclusively focus on cigarette smoking. For this recommendation, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) found this evidence to be most applicable to smoking combustible products (including cigarettes, cigars, cigarillos, and little cigars) and use of e-cigarettes (&ldquo;vaping&rdquo;).</p>\r\n<p>See <a href=\"#tab1\">Table 1</a> for more information on the USPSTF recommendation rationale and assessment. For more details on the methods the USPSTF uses to determine the net benefit, see the USPSTF Procedure Manual.<sup>13</sup> For a summary of the evidence that served as the basis for the recommendations, see the review of the evidence on the benefits and harms of primary care interventions for tobacco use prevention and cessation in children and adolescents.<sup>14,15</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Prevention</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that primary care&ndash;feasible behavioral interventions, including education or brief counseling, to prevent tobacco use in school-aged children and adolescents have a <strong>moderate net benefit</strong>. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that behavioral counseling interventions, such as face-to-face or telephone interaction with a health care clinician, print materials, and computer applications, can have a moderate effect in preventing initiation of tobacco use in school-aged children and adolescents. The USPSTF sought but found no evidence on the harms of behavioral counseling interventions for the prevention or cessation of tobacco use; however, the USPSTF bounds the magnitude of potential harms of behavioral counseling interventions as no greater than small, based on the absence of reported harms in the literature and the noninvasive nature of the interventions (<a href=\"#tab1\">Table 1</a>).</p>\r\n<h3>Cessation</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes that there is <strong>insufficient evidence</strong> to determine the balance of benefits and harms of primary care interventions for tobacco cessation among school-aged children and adolescents who already smoke, because of a lack of adequately powered studies on behavioral counseling interventions and a lack of studies on medications.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the benefit of behavioral counseling interventions for tobacco cessation in school-aged children and adolescents because many studies had small sample sizes and may not have been adequately powered to detect a benefit, making it unclear whether the observed lack of effect of interventions was the result of intervention failure or lack of statistical power. Although the USPSTF found no evidence on the harms of behavioral counseling interventions, it bounds the magnitude of potential harms of behavioral counseling interventions as no greater than small, based on the absence of reported harms in the literature and the noninvasive nature of the interventions.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the benefits and harms of medications for tobacco cessation in children and adolescents, primarily because of an inadequate number of studies that have evaluated tobacco cessation medications in this population. Potential harms depend on the specific medication (<a href=\"#tab1\">Table 1</a>).</p><h2>Table 1.

The USPSTF has issued a separate recommendation statement on interventions for tobacco use cessation in adults 18 years and older, including pregnant persons.<sup>16</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Definitions</h3>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Tobacco use&rdquo; refers to use of any tobacco product. As defined by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), tobacco products include any product made or derived from tobacco intended for human consumption (except products that meet the definition of drugs), including, but not limited to, cigarettes, cigars (including cigarillos and little cigars), dissolvable tobacco, hookah tobacco, nicotine gels, pipe tobacco, roll-your-own tobacco, smokeless tobacco products (including dip, snuff, snus, and chewing tobacco), vapes, e-cigarettes, hookah pens, and other electronic nicotine delivery systems. &ldquo;Smoking&rdquo; generally refers to the inhaling and exhaling of smoke produced by combustible tobacco products such as cigarettes, cigars, and pipes. &ldquo;Vaping&rdquo; refers to the inhaling and exhaling of aerosols produced by e-cigarettes.<sup>17</sup> Vape products usually contain nicotine, which is the addictive ingredient in tobacco. Substances other than tobacco can also be used to smoke or vape.</p>\r\n<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>\r\n<p>All youth are considered at risk of initiating tobacco use. Interventions to prevent the initiation of tobacco use should be provided to all youth who have not started using tobacco products yet, regardless of the presence or absence of other risk factors. The following risk factors may increase the risk of tobacco use in youth: being male, white race, not college-bound, from a rural area, having parents with lower levels of education, parental smoking, having childhood friends who smoke, being an older adolescent, experiencing highly stressful events, and perceiving tobacco use as low risk.<sup>18,19</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Interventions to Prevent Tobacco Use and Implementation Considerations</h3>\r\n<p>Various behavioral counseling intervention types are effective in preventing tobacco initiation in children, including face-to-face counseling, telephone counseling, and computer-based and print-based interventions.<sup>14</sup></p>\r\n<p>Individual interventions target specific audiences (the child/adolescent, the parent, or both) and a variety of age ranges. For example, in the reviewed studies,<sup>14</sup> interventions for children aged 7 to 10 years tended to be print-based materials, whereas face-to-face counseling and telephone- and computer-based interventions typically targeted children older than 10 years. Interventions targeting parents tended to be print- or telephone-based. The number of contacts made with intervention recipients also varied, ranging from 1 to 8 contacts.<sup>14</sup> The intensity of the interventions varied, with the content of the print materials ranging from stickers to informational newsletters or an activity book (for children) or activity guide (for parents). For telephone-based interventions, telephone counseling was usually provided in conjunction with another modality such as print materials or face-to-face counseling. Based on the evidence reviewed,<sup>14</sup> no specific component of behavioral counseling interventions (such as intervention modality, target audience, duration of intervention, or intervention setting) appeared to make an intervention more or less effective. Thus, clinicians have a broad range of effective behavioral counseling interventions from which to choose. For additional information about behavioral counseling interventions to prevent tobacco use, see <a href=\"#tab2\">Table 2</a>, the Additional Tools and Resources section, and the <a href=\"#box\">Box</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Most of the evidence on behavioral counseling interventions to prevent tobacco use focused on prevention of cigarette smoking.<sup>14</sup> Given the similar contextual and cultural issues currently surrounding the use of e-cigarettes in youth and the inclusion of e-cigarettes as a tobacco product by the FDA, the USPSTF concludes that the evidence on interventions to prevent cigarette smoking could be applied to prevention of e-cigarette use as well. The USPSTF also concludes that the evidence could be applied to prevention of cigar use, which includes cigarillos and little cigars.</p>\r\n<h3>Additional Tools and Resources</h3>\r\n<p>Primary care clinicians may find the resources listed in the <a href=\"#box\">Box</a>&nbsp;useful in talking with children and adolescents about the harms of tobacco use.</p>\r\n<h3>Other Related USPSTF Recommendations</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF has made recommendations on behavioral and pharmacotherapy interventions for tobacco smoking cessation in adults, including pregnant women,<sup>16</sup> and primary care behavioral interventions to reduce illicit drug and nonmedical pharmaceutical use in children and adolescents.<sup>35</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement on Cessation</h3>\r\n<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>\r\n<p>Nearly 90% of adult daily smokers smoked their first cigarette by age 18 years.<sup>1</sup> In 2019, an estimated 1.43 million high school and middle school students reported current use of cigars, 1.15 million high school and middle school students reported current use of conventional cigarettes, and 5.38 million high school and middle school students reported current use of e-cigarettes.<sup>7</sup> Of high school and middle school students who used any tobacco product in the past 12 months, 57.5% reported that they had at least 1 quit attempt;<sup>7</sup> however, most quit attempts fail, and about 80% will go on to smoke into adulthood.<sup>36</sup> Immediate adverse health effects in child and adolescent cigarette smokers include increased negative respiratory effects such as impaired lung growth, early onset of lung function decline, respiratory and asthma-related symptoms (eg, coughing and wheezing), and early abdominal aortic atherosclerosis.<sup>1,36</sup> Concerns regarding use of e-cigarettes in adolescence includes nicotine dependence and toxicity, harm to the developing brain, its use as a bridge to conventional cigarette smoking, and inhalation of carcinogens.<sup>5</sup></p>\r\n<p>Although the evidence on behavioral counseling interventions to prevent tobacco use in children and adolescents is robust, fewer studies with smaller sample sizes are available that evaluate the effect of behavioral counseling interventions or pharmacotherapy on tobacco cessation.<sup>14</sup> The pooled effect of the trials that evaluated behavioral counseling interventions for tobacco cessation in primary care settings did not find a significant reduction in smokers after the intervention.<sup>14</sup> However, the study interventions were heterogeneous and most of the studies were small, making it difficult to determine whether interventions were unsuccessful at helping children and adolescents to stop using tobacco, or whether they were underpowered to detect a difference in tobacco cessation.</p>\r\n<p>No medications are currently approved by the FDA for tobacco cessation in children and adolescents. The label for varenicline now states that it is not indicated in children and adolescents 16 years and younger because its efficacy in this population has not been demonstrated.<sup>37</sup> Few trials have been published on medication use for tobacco cessation in children and adolescents (1 trial on nicotine replacement therapy [NRT] and 2 trials on bupropion sustained-release [SR]). Trials were relatively small, and all included behavioral counseling in addition to pharmacotherapy. None found a significant difference in quit rates at the end of treatment.<sup>14</sup> One additional published trial on varenicline for cessation was identified; however, it was not considered in the USPSTF evidence review because the trial included young adults and the mean age of participants was older than the age in the inclusion criteria of the evidence review.</p>\r\n<p>Given the insufficient evidence to identify effective interventions to help youth quit using tobacco, the USPSTF is calling for more research in this area.<em>&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n<h4>Potential Harms</h4>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no evidence on harms from behavioral counseling interventions for tobacco cessation;<sup>14</sup> however, these harms are likely small to none based on the absence of reported harms in the evidence, the noninvasive nature of the interventions, and the low likelihood of serious harms.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found the evidence on harms from medications for tobacco cessation in children and adolescents to be inadequate. None of the published trials reported any serious harms; however, study sizes were relatively small.<sup>14</sup> The single trial of NRT found a greater number of headaches, cough, abnormal dreams, muscle pain, and patch-related adverse events with NRT.<sup>38</sup> Bupropion carries a boxed warning for increased risk of suicidality in children, adolescents, and young adults, with other concerns for increased risk of seizure, hypertension, mania, visual problems, and unusual thoughts and behaviors.<sup>39</sup> Varenicline is not indicated in children 16 years and younger; therefore, no warnings specific to this age group are included in its label.<sup>37</sup> For older populations, labeling includes warnings and precautions for neuropsychiatric adverse events, including suicidality, seizures, interaction with alcohol, cardiovascular events, sleepwalking, angioedema, serious skin reactions, and nausea.<sup>37</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Current Practice</h4>\r\n<p>Approximately one-third to one-half of children and adolescents who have visited a clinician in the past year were asked about their tobacco use.<sup>40,41</sup> Of those who reported tobacco use in the past 30 days, approximately one-fourth were advised to quit.<sup>40,41</sup></p><h2>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h2><p>This recommendation replaces the 2013 USPSTF recommendation on primary care interventions to prevent tobacco use in children and adolescents.<sup>42</sup> It is consistent with the 2013 recommendation, which similarly issued a B recommendation for primary care clinicians to provide interventions to prevent initiation of tobacco use among children and adolescents. New to the current recommendation is the inclusion of e-cigarettes as a tobacco product. Also new to the current recommendation is the I statement on insufficient evidence on interventions for cessation of tobacco use among this population. The USPSTF is calling for more research to identify interventions (behavioral counseling or pharmacotherapy) to help children and adolescents who use tobacco to quit.</p><h2>Table 2.

As mentioned previously, the USPSTF determined that this evidence could be applied to other forms of tobacco use, including e-cigarette use.</p>\r\n<h3>Prevention</h3>\r\n<p>Fourteen trials (n = 25,049) reported on the effects of behavioral counseling interventions to prevent the initiation of smoking.<sup>14</sup> Nine of these trials enrolled only children who were nonsmokers at baseline, while 5 trials enrolled both smokers and nonsmokers but reported results by baseline smoking status. The weighted mean age of participants was 12.8 years, although eligible ages ranged from 7 to 19 years across studies.<sup>14</sup></p>\r\n<p>Most studies used interventions that targeted the child/adolescent, although some targeted both children and parents/caregivers and a few targeted only the parents/caregivers. Intervention content included health education, readiness to act or change, and parenting skills (communication and positive parenting). Delivery settings of interventions varied and included primary care clinics, dental clinics, schools (after hours), and the child&rsquo;s home. Various types of interventions were used, including print materials, face-to-face counseling, telephone support, and computer-based interventions. Six of the studies used only a single intervention type, and 8 studies used combinations of various interventions (eg, telephone counseling plus print materials or face-to-face counseling plus a computer-based intervention). Most studies reported that fewer youth initiated smoking when they received a behavioral counseling intervention (follow-up was most commonly at 12 months but ranged from 7 to 36 months).<sup>14</sup> This finding was not always statistically significant for individual studies; however, this reduction was statistically significant when results from trials were pooled: 7.4% vs 9.2% of participants initiated smoking in the intervention groups vs the control groups (relative risk, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.73-0.92]; 13 studies; n = 21,700).<sup>14</sup> No effect modification was found by intervention type, setting, or target population (child vs parent).<sup>14</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Cessation</h3>\r\n<p>Nine trials (n = 2516) reported on the effects of behavioral counseling interventions on smoking cessation in youth; 6 trials had fewer than 65 participants analyzed per intervention group.<sup>14</sup> Four trials enrolled only smokers, while 5 trials enrolled both smokers and nonsmokers but reported results by baseline smoking status.<sup>14</sup> The weighted mean average age of participants in cessation trials was much older than in the prevention trials (16.6 years [range, 12-19 years]).<sup>14</sup></p>\r\n<p>Nearly all interventions targeted the child/adolescent and very few targeted parents/caregivers. Intervention content most commonly focused on assessing and facilitating the youth&rsquo;s readiness to change; a few interventions included health education. The delivery setting of interventions was most commonly a primary care or dental clinic; a few studies delivered interventions at home. Nearly all interventions used combinations of intervention types, most commonly face-to face counseling; telephone- and computer-based interventions and print materials (1 intervention) were used less commonly. Two trials reported significant increases in smoking cessation rates in youth receiving interventions.<sup>21,43</sup> One trial used a combination of motivational interviewing supplemented with handouts, a computer program, and telephone calls;<sup>21</sup> the other trial used a combination of 1 face-to-face session supplemented with 1 telephone call.<sup>43</sup> Meta-analysis of all 9 trials reported a risk reduction of percent smokers after the intervention that was not statistically significant (relative risk, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.93-1.01]); 80.6% of participants in the intervention groups were still smoking at the end of the study (range, 6-18 months), vs 84.1% in the control groups.<sup>14</sup> However, given the small study sizes, it was unclear whether this finding was a result of the studies being underpowered to detect a change in smoking behavior. Additional analyses were performed to evaluate if various factors, such as intervention type, setting, target population (child vs parent), or study duration may modify whether an intervention was effective. No factors were identified that modified the effect of interventions.<sup>14</sup></p>\r\n<p>Three trials (n = 788) reported on the effect of medications on smoking cessation in youth.<sup>14</sup> Two trials evaluated bupropion SR<sup>44,45</sup> and 1 trial evaluated NRT.<sup>46</sup> All trials were relatively small (211 to 312 participants per trial), and all trials also included behavioral counseling interventions in addition to medications. One of the bupropion SR trials also included NRT for all participants.<sup>44</sup> None of the trials reported that medications improved cessation rates; smoking rates remained high in both the treatment and the control groups in all trials. In the bupropion SR trials, 87.5% to 93.8% of participants were still smoking at the 6-month follow-up;<sup>44,45</sup> 95.6% of the NRT group and 93.4% of the control group were still smoking at 12 months in the NRT trial.<sup>46</sup> The USPSTF also identified 1 published trial of varenicline for tobacco cessation in older adolescents and young adults<sup>47</sup> and 1 unpublished trial of varenicline for tobacco cessation in adolescents.<sup>48,49</sup> Results from these trials were not considered by the USPSTF because of the older age of participants<sup>47</sup> and because the study results were not published in a peer-reviewed journal.<sup>48,49</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Primary Care Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF evaluated harms of behavioral counseling interventions from the 18 trials that reported on benefits of interventions on smoking prevention and smoking cessation, as well as 4 additional trials that reported on the effect of behavioral counseling interventions on smoking prevalence irrespective of baseline smoking status.<sup>14</sup> None of the 22 trials reported adverse events or harms associated with behavioral counseling interventions.<sup>14</sup> Some trials reported higher smoking rates at follow-up in intervention groups compared with control groups, but this finding was not statistically significant in any of the trials.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF evaluated harms of medications for smoking cessation from 4 trials (n = 914);<sup>14</sup> the 3 trials described above (2 of bupropion and 1 of NRT), as well as a fourth trial of bupropion SR that did not meet inclusion criteria for evidence on benefits because its follow-up was less than 6 months.<sup>50</sup> No difference in serious or severe adverse events was reported with bupropion vs control groups, although 2 trials reported that 4% of participants withdrew because of adverse events with bupropion.<sup>14</sup> Some studies reported more headaches, cough, dream disturbance, insomnia, and irritability with bupropion than the control group.<sup>14</sup> Although no cases were reported in the studies included in the current review, bupropion carries a boxed warning for increased risk of suicidality in children, adolescents, and young adults, and the insert also includes other concerns for increased risk of seizure, hypertension, mania, visual problems, and unusual thoughts and behaviors.<sup>39</sup> In the single NRT trial, NRT was associated with more headaches, cough, abnormal dreams, muscle pain, and patch-related adverse events than placebo.<sup>38</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from June 25 to July 22, 2019. Several comments requested that the USPSTF recommend behavioral counseling interventions for tobacco cessation in youth, given the known harms of tobacco use in youth and the lack of proven harms from counseling interventions. The USPSTF only recommends a preventive service when there is at least adequate evidence that there is a net benefit to providing the service; absence of harms from a service is not sufficient evidence for the USPSTF to recommend a preventive service. However, as with all findings of insufficient evidence, the USPSTF calls for more research on identifying ways to help youth who use tobacco to quit. The USPSTF has also clarified in its Practice Considerations section that given the finding of insufficient evidence, health care practitioners should determine if offering behavioral counseling for tobacco cessation to certain individuals is reasonable. Other comments requested clarification about which tobacco products the USPSTF recommendation addresses. The USPSTF clarified this in the USPSTF Assessment of Magnitude of Net Benefit section. Additional changes made to the recommendation statement in response to public comment include clarification of which population the recommendation applies to (see the Practice Considerations section), use of the term &ldquo;e-cigarettes&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS)&rdquo; throughout the document to be consistent with the field, and consideration of additional Research Needs and Gaps and Suggested Tools.</p><h2>Research Needs and Gaps</h2><p>More studies are needed to identify effective interventions to help children and adolescents who use tobacco products to quit.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Larger, adequately powered studies and studies of new behavioral counseling interventions for cessation are needed.\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>These studies should report tobacco cessation outcomes at 6 months or later and should also provide information on components of the behavioral counseling intervention provided in the study (such as intensity of delivery, frequency of contacts, content and type of counseling or materials provided, delivery setting of studies, and training of persons delivering the intervention).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>More studies are needed that evaluate the benefits and harms of medications to help youth with tobacco cessation.</li>\r\n<li>More research is needed on interventions tailored specifically to prevent initiation of use and promote cessation of e-cigarette use in youth. The landscape of e-cigarette devices is rapidly evolving, so research in this area is challenged by the need to be timely, flexible, and comprehensive.</li>\r\n<li>More research is also needed on interventions tailored specifically to prevent initiation of use and promote cessation of other types of tobacco (such as, but not limited to, cigars and smokeless tobacco) and interventions tailored to subpopulations with elevated tobacco use rates (such as African American youth, Native American/Alaska Native youth, LGBTQ youth, and youth with mental illness).</li>\r\n</ul><h2>Recommendations of Others</h2><p>The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that pediatricians provide brief counseling to all children and adolescents to prevent tobacco use initiation, and that all teenagers be screened for tobacco and nicotine use. For adolescents who want to stop using tobacco, it recommends that tobacco dependence treatment, referral, or both be offered, and that tobacco dependence pharmacotherapy can be considered for adolescents who are moderately to severely dependent on tobacco who want to stop smoking. e-Cigarettes are not recommended as a treatment for tobacco dependence.<sup>51</sup> The AAP also recommends that pediatricians screen children and adolescents, parents, and caregivers for e-cigarette use, and provide prevention counseling for children and adolescents. Further, it recommends that parents, caregivers, and adolescents who use e-cigarettes should be offered or referred to tobacco cessation counseling and FDA-approved tobacco dependence pharmacotherapy appropriate to their level of addiction and readiness to change and, again, that e-cigarettes are not recommended as a treatment for tobacco dependence. Last, the AAP recommends addressing parent and caregiver tobacco dependence as part of the pediatric visit.<sup>52</sup> According to the US Surgeon General, smoking cessation is beneficial at any age,<sup>53</sup> tobacco prevention efforts must focus on both adolescents and young adults,<sup>36</sup> and health care professionals should warn youth of the health risks of e-cigarettes and other nicotine-containing products.<sup>5</sup> The American Academy of Family Physicians supports the 2013 USPSTF recommendation.<sup>54</sup></p>","topic":"Tobacco Use in Children and Adolescents: Primary Care Interventions","keywords":"Tobacco|Cigarettes|E-cigarettes|E-cig|Vaping|Cigar|Cigarillos|Cigarettes|Nicotine|ENDS|Electronic Nicotine Delivery System(s)|Smoking|Childhood smoking|Adolescent smoking|Smoking cessation|Childhood smoking cessation|Adolescent smoking cessation|Smoking prevention|Childhood Smoking prevention|Adolescent smoking prevention|Tobacco cessation|Childhood tobacco cessation|Adolescent tobacco cessation|Tobacco prevention|Childhood tobacco prevention|Adolescent tobacco prevention|Nicotine Use|Childhood nicotine use|Adolescent nicotine use","pubDate":"2020-04-28","categories":["3","10","8","1"],"tool":["227","230","229","228"]},"419":{"topicType":"Screening","topicYear":2020,"uspstfAlias":"cognitive-impairment-in-older-adults-screening","specific":[523],"title":"Cognitive Impairment in Older Adults: Screening","rationale":"<h2>Importance</h2><p>According to the American Psychiatric Association&rsquo;s <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (Fifth Edition) (<em>DSM-5</em>), dementia (also known as major neurocognitive disorder) is defined by a significant decline in 1 or more cognitive domains that interferes with a person&rsquo;s independence in daily activities. The 6 cognitive domains identified in the <em>DSM-5</em> are complex attention, executive function, learning and memory, language, perceptual motor function, and social cognition.<sup>1</sup> Dementia affects an estimated 2.4 to 5.5 million persons in the United States, and its prevalence increases with age. Dementia affects an estimated 3.2% of persons aged 65 to 74 years, 9.9% of those aged 75 to 84 years, and 29.3% of those 85 years or older.<sup>2</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) differs from dementia in that the impairment is not severe enough to interfere with independent daily functioning. Some persons with MCI may progress to dementia, while some do not.

Early detection and diagnosis of dementia through the assessment of signs and symptoms recognized by the patient, family, or clinician, which may be subtle, are not considered screening and are therefore not the focus of this recommendation.</p>\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Assessment of Risk</h3>\r\n<p>Increasing age is the strongest known risk factor for cognitive impairment.<sup>9</sup> The &epsilon;4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (<em>apoE</em>) gene is a reported risk factor for Alzheimer disease in white and Asian populations.<sup>10</sup> Other risk factors include cardiovascular risk factors (eg, diabetes, hypertension, or hypercholesterolemia), depression, physical frailty, low education level, and low social support level.<sup>10-13</sup> Several dietary and lifestyle factors have been reported as associated with decreased risk of cognitive impairment. These include adequate folic acid intake, low saturated fat intake, higher longer-chain omega-3 fatty acid intake, high fruit and vegetable intake, the Mediterranean diet, moderate alcohol intake (1 to 6 drinks per week vs abstention), higher educational attainment, cognitive engagement, social engagement, and higher physical activity levels.<sup>10,11,14,15</sup></p>\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>Many different brief screening tests for cognitive impairment are available. Screening tests generally include asking patients to perform a series of tasks that assess 1 or more domains of cognitive function. These tests are not intended to diagnose MCI or dementia. A positive screening test result should lead to additional testing that can include blood tests, radiology examinations, and a medical and neuropsychologic evaluation to confirm the diagnosis of dementia and determine its subtype.</p>\r\n<p>The most well-studied screening instrument is the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Other screening instruments include the clock drawing test (CDT), Memory Impairment Screen (MIS)/MIS by Telephone (MIS-T), Mental Status Questionnaire (MSQ), Mini-Cog verbal fluency, 8-Item Informant Interview (AD8), Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ), 7-Minute Screen (7MS), Abbreviated Mental Test (AMT), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), St. Louis University Mental Status Examination (SLUMS), Telephone Instrument for Cognitive Status (TICS), and Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE). For more information on all screening instruments reviewed by the USPSTF, see the full evidence report.<sup>16,17</sup></p>\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Treatment and Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>Treatment of cognitive impairment may focus on one or more signs and symptoms, including cognition, quality of life, mood, and behavioral impairments.</p>\r\n<p>Several pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions aim to slow, prevent, or reverse cognitive impairment; stabilize or improve functional performance; improve caregiver burden and depression; or improve patient, caregiver, and clinician decision-making. Pharmacologic treatments approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for Alzheimer disease include acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) and memantine. Nonpharmacologic interventions include cognitive training, cognitive rehabilitation, cognitive stimulation interventions, exercise, peer support, psychoeducation, and care management.</p>\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>\r\n<h4 align=\"left\">Potential Preventable Burden</h4>\r\n<p>Dementia affects an estimated 2.4 to 5.5 million persons in the United States, and its prevalence increases with age. Dementia affects an estimated 9.9% of persons aged 75 to 84 years and 29.3% of those 85 years or older.<sup>2</sup> Subjective memory issues are common in adults, with studies showing that approximately 50%<sup>18</sup> to 75%<sup>19</sup> of adults have at least minor concerns about their memory.</p>\r\n<p>Although there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening for cognitive impairment, there may be important reasons to identify cognitive impairment early. Burdens of cognitive impairment include direct effects on the patient (eg, loss of function and relationships, financial misjudgments, and nonadherence with recommended therapies), direct effects on caregivers (eg, burden and depression), and effects on society (eg, costs of care). Early detection of cognitive impairment can allow for identification and treatment of reversible causes, may help clinicians anticipate problems patients may have in understanding and adhering to medical treatment plans, and may also be useful by providing a basis for advance planning on the part of patients and families. Clinicians should remain alert to early signs or symptoms of cognitive impairment (eg, problems with memory or language) and evaluate the individual as appropriate. However, none of the potential benefits of screening have been clearly demonstrated in clinical trials.</p>\r\n<h4 align=\"left\">Potential Harms</h4>\r\n<p>Evidence about the harms of screening is limited. One potential harm is labeling a person with an illness that is typically progressive and for which treatment appears to have limited effectiveness. Some studies have shown higher stress, greater depression, and lower quality of life in persons aware of a diagnosis of cognitive impairment,<sup>20</sup> while others have found no such association.<sup>21,22</sup> Evidence about the effects of false-positive results is limited. AChEIs are associated with harms, some of which are serious, including central nervous system disturbances, bradycardia, and falls. Evidence about the harms of nonpharmacologic interventions is limited, but these harms are assumed to be small.</p>\r\n<h4 align=\"left\">Current Practice</h4>\r\n<p>Most commonly, evaluation for or diagnosis of cognitive impairment occurs as a result of patient- or caregiver-reported concerns or symptoms, or clinician&rsquo;s suspicion. As many as 29% to 76% of patients with dementia are unrecognized in the primary care setting.<sup>23-25</sup> In 2011, Medicare added detection of cognitive impairment to its annual wellness visit. The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services recommend assessing a patient&rsquo;s cognitive function by direct observation; considering information and concerns reported by the patient, family members, friends, caregivers, and others; and, if deemed appropriate, using a brief validated, structured cognitive assessment tool.<sup>26</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Additional Tools and Resources</h4>\r\n<p>The National Institute on Aging has useful information on the definition, detection, and management of cognitive impairment for patients and clinicians, including links to some screening instruments, on its website.<sup>27</sup></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Other Related USPSTF Recommendations</h2><p>The USPSTF has recommendations related to several risk factors for cognitive impairment, including pharmacotherapy and counseling for tobacco cessation;<sup>28</sup>&nbsp;screening and counseling to reduce unhealthy alcohol use;<sup>29</sup>&nbsp;counseling to promote healthful diet and physical activity;<sup>30,31</sup>&nbsp;statins to reduce cardiovascular disease risk;<sup>32</sup>&nbsp;and screening for hypertension,<sup>33</sup> abnormal blood glucose levels,<sup>34</sup> and depression.<sup>35</sup></p><h2>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h2><p>This recommendation updates the 2014 USPSTF recommendation on screening for cognitive impairment in older adults. In 2014, the USPSTF concluded that the evidence was insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for cognitive impairment.<sup>36</sup> For the current recommendation, the USPSTF again concludes that the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for cognitive impairment in older adults.</p>","other":"<h2>Supporting Evidence</h2><h3 align=\"left\">Scope of Review</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>To update its 2014 recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a systematic review<sup>16,17</sup> on the benefits and harms of screening for cognitive impairment, including MCI and mild to moderate dementia, in community-dwelling adults, including those 65 years or older residing in independent living facilities. The systematic review included evidence on the accuracy of screening tests to detect cognitive impairment and the benefits and harms of treatments and interventions for older adults with cognitive impairment and their caregivers. The review focused on older adults with MCI or mild to moderate dementia, as these are the patients most likely to be identified by screening.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Accuracy of Screening Tests</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found 59 studies that evaluated 49 screening instruments to detect cognitive impairment. Among the studies, the prevalence of dementia ranged from 1% to 47% and the prevalence of MCI ranged from 10% to 52%. The mean age of participants ranged from 68 to 95 years. Education level of participants, which was reported in 22 studies, ranged from a mean of 5 to 16 years of education. Most of the instruments evaluated were very brief (evaluation time &le;5 minutes) or brief (evaluation time &le;10 minutes).[[16.17]]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Screening instruments evaluated in more than 1 study included the MMSE, CDT, MIS/MIS-T, MSQ, Mini-Cog verbal fluency, AD8, FAQ, 7MS, AMT, Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale, MoCA, SLUMS, TICS, and IQCODE. The MMSE was the most evaluated instrument (30 studies). The MMSE is an 11-item instrument with a maximum score of 30 points. In a pooled analysis of 14 studies using cutoffs of 23 or less or 24 or less (score considered a positive screening result) (n = 11,972), the MMSE had a sensitivity of 0.89 (95% CI, 0.85 to 0.92) and a specificity of 0.90 (95% CI, 0.86 to 0.93) to detect dementia. The other instruments were studied in fewer studies (2 to 9 studies), and cutoffs for screening instruments often varied across studies. Sensitivity and specificity of these instruments to detect dementia varied widely in these studies, from 0.43 to 1.0 and 0.54 to 1.0, respectively. Across all instruments, test accuracy (ie, sensitivity and specificity) was generally higher to detect dementia compared with MCI.[[16.17]]</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Benefits of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found 1 trial, IU-CHOICE<sup>37</sup> (n = 4005), that examined the effect of screening for cognitive impairment on health-related quality of life (HRQOL), health care utilization, and measures of advance care planning. This trial found no differences in HRQOL at 1, 6, or 12 months and no differences in health care utilization or measures of advance care planning at 12 months in screening compared with control groups. Limitations of this trial include that 38% of persons assessed for eligibility refused to participate, and 66% of participants who screened positive refused diagnostic assessment and follow-up. Additionally, the trial was missing 42% of HRQOL outcomes data at 12 months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found 48 trials (n = 22,431) that evaluated the effects of AChEIs (donepezil [18 studies; n = 6209], galantamine [10 studies; n = 7464], rivastigmine [8 studies; n = 4569], and memantine [12 studies; n = 4189]) on global cognitive function. Many of these trials reported differences in scores on the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale&ndash;Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog-11) or the MMSE. AChEIs and memantine improved measures of global cognitive function in the short term, but the magnitude of change was small. In pooled analyses, the differences in changes between patients taking AChEIs or memantine compared with patients taking placebo ranged from approximately 1 to 2.5 points on the ADAS-Cog-11 (scale range, 0-70) and 0.5 to 1 points on the MMSE (scale range, 0-30) over 3 months to 3 years of follow-up.[[16.17]] Changes of this magnitude would generally not be considered clinically important.<sup>38</sup> AChEIs and memantine increased the likelihood of improving or maintaining patients&rsquo; global function, typically as assessed by the Clinician&rsquo;s Interview-Based Impression of Change Plus Informant Input (CIBIC+), by 15% (for memantine) to 50% (for rivastigmine) in the short term; however, change at longer-term follow-up was not reported.[[16.17]]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the evidence on the effectiveness of AChEIs and memantine comes from trials involving persons with dementia, particularly those with moderate as opposed to mild dementia, and most commonly Alzheimer disease. Four trials (n = 1919) tested donepezil or memantine in persons with MCI. These trials showed no improvement in global cognitive function.[[16.17]]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Twenty-nine trials (n = 6489) evaluated other medications or supplements, including antihypertensives, statins, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, gonadal steroids, and dietary supplements and vitamins (multivitamins, B vitamins, vitamin E, and omega-3 fatty acids). None of the trials found any improvement in global cognition or physical function in persons with mild to moderate dementia or MCI.[[16.17]]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sixty-one trials (n = 7847) evaluated nonpharmacologic patient-level interventions, including cognitive-focused, exercise, multicomponent, and other interventions. In general, these trials were small and of limited duration. This body of evidence represented persons with dementia and MCI, with a mean age of 75 years. Among all interventions, there was no clear improvement in global or domain-specific measures of cognitive function compared with controls at 3 months to 2 years of follow-up.[[16.17]]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fifty-eight trials (n = 9139) evaluated psychoeducation interventions targeting the caregiver or caregiver-patient dyad. Most trials targeted patients with dementia, and the average MMSE score in studies that reported it was 16.2, consistent with moderate dementia. The interventions were highly variable, with most including training in problem solving, communications, and stress management, in addition to providing information about dementia and community resources. Overall, there was a small improvement in caregiver burden and depression measures, primarily in persons caring for patients with moderate dementia. For example, a pooled analysis of 9 trials (n = 1089) that reported change in the Zarit-22 (a 22-item scale of caregiver burden, with a score ranging from 0 to 88) found an average 2.5-point improvement (mean difference, &ndash;2.5 [95% CI, &ndash;3.9 to &ndash;1.0]), and a pooled analysis of 20 trials (n = 2603) that reported change in the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD) (a 20-item scale of depressive symptoms, with a score ranging from 0 to 60) found a mean 2.67-point improvement (mean difference, &ndash;2.67 [95% CI, &ndash;3.45 to &ndash;1.48]) in the intervention groups.[[16.17]]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seventeen trials (n = 3039) evaluated care or case management interventions. All interventions were intended for patients with dementia. Of the 12 trials that reported caregiver burden outcomes, 5 found a statistically significant improvement in scores. A pooled analysis of 8 trials (n = 1215) found a standardized pooled effect of &ndash;0.54 (95% CI, &ndash;0.85 to &ndash;0.22), translating to a between-group difference of approximately 3.5 to 4 points on the Zarit-22. Seven trials reported caregiver depression outcomes. A pooled analysis of 4 of these trials (n = 668) showed no improvement in caregiver depression measures.[[16.17]]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two trials reported the effects of interventions on planning or decision-making outcomes. One trial (n = 111)<sup>39</sup> reported the effects of a psychoeducational intervention on caregivers&rsquo; planning or decision-making related to caring for a relative with dementia. Three months after the intervention, caregivers in both the intervention and usual care groups reported significantly better planning for future needs, and there was no difference between the intervention and usual care groups. A second trial (the Maximizing Independence at Home [MIND] Care Coordination Trial) (n = 303)<sup>40</sup> assessed whether a care coordination intervention reduced unmet care needs related to dementia compared with usual care. Evaluators assessed 19 common care needs for participants (71 items) and caregivers (15 items) as being either &ldquo;fully met&rdquo; or &ldquo;unmet.&rdquo; After 18 months, there was no difference in reduction of total percentage of unmet needs in the intervention group vs usual care.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, the body of evidence on the potential benefits of screening for cognitive impairment is limited by several factors. These include the short duration of most trials (often &le;6 months for pharmacologic agents and &le;1 year for nonpharmacologic interventions), as well as the heterogeneous nature of interventions and inconsistency in the outcomes reported, which make cross-study comparisons difficult. As noted, for interventions for which studies reported an improvement in measures, the average effect sizes were small and of uncertain clinical importance. In addition, no interventions specifically targeted a screen-detected population. Most of the evidence suggesting improvement is applicable to persons with moderate dementia; thus, its applicability to a screen-detected population is uncertain.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Harms of Screening and Treatment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found 1 trial (IU-CHOICE)<sup>37</sup> that addressed the potential harms of screening for cognitive impairment. This trial and its limitations are described above. The trial found no differences in depression or anxiety (as measured by PHQ-9 and GAD-7) in participants randomized to screening vs control groups at 1, 6, or 12 months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Forty-eight randomized clinical trials (n = 22,431) and 3 observational studies (n = 190,076) reported on the harms of treatment with AChEIs and memantine.[[16.17]] Adverse effects of medications were common. Adverse events were significantly higher in patients receiving AChEIs, and more patients receiving AChEIs withdrew from studies or discontinued their medication compared with patients receiving placebo. Memantine was better tolerated, with no increase in adverse events or withdrawal rates compared with placebo. Overall, there was no increase in serious adverse events in patients taking AChEIs. However, some individual studies reported increased rates of serious adverse events, such as bradycardia, syncope, falls, and need for pacemaker placement among patients taking AChEIs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Twenty-one of the trials (n = 5688) that evaluated other medications or supplements reported on harms. Harms were not clearly significantly increased in intervention groups compared with control groups.[[16.17]]&nbsp;For nonpharmacologic patient-level interventions, few studies reported on harms. Little harm was evident in the 12 studies (n = 2370) that reported it.[[16.17]]</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from September 10, 2019, to October 7, 2019. Several comments agreed that the evidence on screening for cognitive impairment is insufficient. Several comments expressed that readers might misinterpret the I statement as a recommendation against screening, or interpreted the I statement as a recommendation against screening. In response, the USPSTF wants to clarify that its I statement is a conclusion that the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for cognitive impairment and is neither a recommendation for nor against screening. Several comments disagreed with the I statement and felt that the USPSTF should recommend screening for cognitive impairment based on the potential benefits mentioned in the Practice Considerations section. In response, the USPSTF clarified that while there <em>may</em> be important reasons to identify cognitive impairment early, none of the potential benefits mentioned in this section have been clearly demonstrated in controlled trials. Several comments noted that cognitive impairment often goes unrecognized. The USPSTF agrees and added language to the Practice Considerations section noting that clinicians should remain alert to early signs or symptoms of cognitive impairment. Some comments suggested additional studies that should be considered by the USPSTF. Some of the suggested studies investigated the prevention of cognitive impairment by controlling risk factors, such as hypertension, or by use of a multidomain intervention (eg, diet, physical activity, cognitive training, and risk factor control). However, none of these suggested studies met inclusion criteria for this recommendation; that is, they were not studies of screening for and/or treatment of cognitive impairment or mild to moderate dementia. Also, the USPSTF added the American Academy of Neurology&rsquo;s guidelines on the detection of cognitive impairment to the Recommendations of Others section.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Dementia can be the result of varied and different pathophysiologic processes affecting the brain, and the exact causal mechanism for many types of dementia is unknown. Therefore, the development of early interventions that result in important clinical effects on dementia has been challenging. The most common cause of dementia in the United States is Alzheimer disease, which is the target of all current drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for dementia. Since current medical therapies for dementia do not appear to affect its long-term course, the potential benefit of screening may be in devising effective interventions that can help patients and caregivers prepare for managing the symptoms and consequences of dementia.</p><h2>Research Needs and Gaps</h2><ul>\r\n\t<li>More research is needed on the effect of screening and early detection of cognitive impairment (MCI and mild to moderate dementia) on important patient, caregiver, and societal outcomes, including decision-making, advance planning, and caregiver outcomes.</li>\r\n\t<li>The body of evidence on screening and interventions for cognitive impairment would benefit from more consistent definitions and reporting of outcomes to allow comparisons across trials, especially from trials with longer-term follow-up.</li>\r\n\t<li>Studies are needed of the effects of caregiver or patient-caregiver dyad interventions on delay or prevention of institutionalization, and the effects of delay in institutionalization on caregivers.</li>\r\n\t<li>Research is needed on treatments that clearly affect the long-term clinical course of cognitive impairment. It is also important that studies on screening and interventions for cognitive impairment report harms and reasons for attrition of trial participants.</li>\r\n</ul><h2>Recommendations of Others</h2><p>The American Academy of Family Physicians supports the 2014 USPSTF recommendation on screening for cognitive impairment in older adults.<sup>41</sup> The American Academy of Neurology has published guidance on the detection of cognitive impairment during the annual wellness visit and recommends the use of a brief, validated cognitive assessment instrument to assess for cognitive impairment.<sup>42</sup></p>","topic":"Cognitive Impairment in Older Adults: Screening","keywords":"Dementia|Alzheimer's Disease|Cognitive Impairment|Screening|Adults|Older Adults","pubDate":"2020-02-25","categories":["8"],"tool":["231","235","234","233","232"]},"420":{"topicType":"Screening","topicYear":2019,"uspstfAlias":"hepatitis-b-virus-infection-in-pregnant-women-screening","specific":[503],"title":"Hepatitis B Virus Infection in Pregnant Women: Screening","rationale":"<h2>Rationale</h2><h3>Importance</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Screening for HBV infection during pregnancy identifies women whose infants are at risk of perinatal transmission. Data from a nationally representative sample showed a prevalence of maternal HBV infection of 85.8 cases per 100,000 deliveries from 1998 to 2011 (0.09% of live-born singleton deliveries in the United States).<sup>1,2</sup> Although there are guidelines for universal infant HBV vaccination, rates of maternal HBV infection have increased annually by 5.5% since 1998.<sup>1,2</sup> Persons infected with HBV during infancy or childhood are more likely to develop chronic infection. Chronic HBV infection increases long-term morbidity and mortality by predisposing infected persons to cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Reaffirmation</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2009, the USPSTF reviewed the evidence for screening for HBV infection in pregnant women and issued an A recommendation.<sup>3</sup> The USPSTF has decided to use a reaffirmation deliberation process to update this recommendation. The USPSTF uses the reaffirmation process for well-established, evidence-based standards of practice in current primary care practice for which only a very high level of evidence would justify a change in the grade of the recommendation.<sup>4</sup> In its deliberation of the evidence, the USPSTF considers whether the new evidence is of sufficient strength and quality to change its previous conclusions about the evidence.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Detection</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF previously reviewed the evidence on serologic testing for HBV (hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]) in pregnancy and found adequate evidence of its accuracy (sensitivity and specificity both &gt;98%).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Interventions</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found convincing evidence that universal prenatal screening for HBV infection substantially reduces perinatal transmission of HBV and the subsequent development of chronic HBV infection. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that vaccination of all infants against HBV infection and providing postexposure prophylaxis with hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) at birth to infants of mothers infected with HBV substantially reduce the risk for acquisition of HBV infection in infants.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Harms of Screening and Interventions</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found limited evidence on the harms of screening for HBV infection in pregnant women but bounded the potential harms of screening as no greater than small based on the high accuracy of screening and the low likelihood of harms from preventive interventions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Using a reaffirmation process, the USPSTF concludes with high certainty that the net benefit of screening for HBV infection in pregnant women is substantial.</p>","clinical":"<h2>Clinical Considerations</h2><h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>This recommendation applies to all pregnant persons.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The principal screening test for detecting maternal HBV infection is the serologic identification of HBsAg. Screening should be performed in each pregnancy, regardless of previous HBV vaccination or previous negative HBsAg test results.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Screening Interval</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A test for HBsAg should be ordered at the first prenatal visit. Women with unknown HBsAg status or with new or continuing risk factors for HBV infection (eg, injection drug use or a sexually transmitted infection) should be screened at the time of admission to a hospital or other delivery setting.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Treatment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Interventions to prevent perinatal transmission of HBV infection include screening all pregnant women for HBV, vaccinating infants born to HBV-negative mothers within 24 hours of birth, and completing the HBV vaccination series in infants by age 18 months. For HBV-positive mothers, case management during pregnancy includes HBV DNA viral load testing and referral to specialty care for counseling and medical management of HBV infection. For infants born to mothers who test positive for HBsAg, current guidelines for case management include HBV vaccination and hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) prophylaxis within 12 hours of birth, completing the vaccine series, and serologic testing for infection and immunity at age 9 to 12 months. For infants born to mothers with unknown HBsAg status, current guidelines for case management include HBV vaccination within 12 hours of birth, followed by HBIG prophylaxis.<sup>5</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Emerging evidence has demonstrated that administering tenofovir to HBV-positive women with acute infection significantly reduces the risk of HBsAg seropositivity in infants when combined with HBIG prophylaxis at birth and HBV vaccination.<sup>6,7</sup> As a result, recent guidelines recommend testing for viral load, antiviral treatment, and HBV vaccination and HBIG prophylaxis.<sup>5</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Useful Resources</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF has made recommendations on screening for other infections, including chlamydia and gonorrhea,<sup>8</sup> HBV in nonpregnant adults and adolescents,<sup>9</sup> genital herpes,<sup>10</sup> HIV,<sup>11</sup> and syphilis in pregnant women.<sup>12</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides more information about HBV infection, including perinatal transmission.<sup>13,14</sup></p><h2>Other Considerations</h2><h3>Implementation</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Universal screening for HBV infection in women during pregnancy is standard clinical practice in the United States. Presently, 26 states have laws mandating prenatal HBV screening.<sup>15</sup> Although rates of maternal screening for HBV infection range from 84% to 88%, screening rates during the first trimester are lower, with 60% of commercially insured and 39% of Medicaid-enrolled women screened during the first trimester.<sup>16</sup> Seventy-one percent of infants receive HBV vaccination within 3 days of birth.<sup>1,17</sup> Primary care clinicians and delivery settings must establish effective systems for the accurate and timely transfer of maternal HBsAg test results to labor, delivery, and newborn medical records to maximize benefit.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF has identified areas of needed research. Continued research on effective implementation of case management in vulnerable populations most at risk for perinatal transmission of HBV infection is needed. Additional studies on the effectiveness of prenatal antiviral medication to reduce perinatal transmission are needed. Analyses of recent data from existing case management programs, such as the Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program (PHBPP), would be helpful in understanding program performance and research needs.<sup>1</sup> There is emerging evidence on the use of antiviral therapy during pregnancy.<sup>1,6,7</sup>&nbsp;Further research is needed to examine the prevention of perinatal transmission.</p>","other":"<h2>Recommendations of Others</h2><p>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends screening for HBV with serologic testing for HBsAg in every pregnant patient at the earliest prenatal visit. These tests should be designated as &ldquo;prenatal.&rdquo; Pregnant women who test positive for HBsAg should then be tested for HBV DNA.<sup>29</sup> The CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices similarly recommends testing for HBsAg in all pregnant women during an early prenatal visit (e.g., in the first trimester) and HBV DNA testing for pregnant women who test positive for HBsAg.<sup>5</sup> The American Academy of Family Physicians recommends screening for HBV infection in pregnant women at their first prenatal visit.<sup>30</sup> The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases recommends screening in all pregnant women by testing for HBsAg and the hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs).<sup>24</sup></p>","discussion":"<h2>Discussion</h2><h3>Burden of Disease</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Hepatitis B is a viral infection of the liver transmitted through contact with the bodily fluids or blood of an infected individual. In the United States, prevalence estimates of chronic HBV infection range from approximately 850,000 to more than 2 million cases.<sup>1,18-20</sup> In the United States, new cases of HBV among adults are largely transmitted through injection drug use or sexual intercourse, but most prevalent cases of HBV infection are chronic infections from exposure occurring in infancy or childhood. Another major risk factor for HBV infection is country of origin. In the United States, adults with HBV born in high-prevalence countries were commonly infected during birth.<sup>19</sup> In US-born children, the primary source of infection is vertical transmission at birth.<sup>21</sup> According to the CDC, 800 to 1000 cases of perinatal transmission (3.8% of infants born to HBV-positive women) occurred yearly from 2000 to 2009.<sup>22</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since 1998, rates of maternal HBV infection have increased annually by 5.5%.<sup>1,2</sup> Older maternal age, race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic black and Asian populations), lower education, higher poverty levels, and lack of insurance coverage are risk factors for HBV infection among women.<sup>2,23</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Persons infected with HBV during infancy or childhood are more likely to develop chronic HBV infection and have poor long-term health outcomes (eg, chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, or hepatocellular carcinoma) compared with persons infected later in life.<sup>1</sup> Acute HBV infections progress to chronic disease in 80% to 90% of infected infants, 30% of acute infections progress before age 6 years, and less than 1% to 12% of acute infections progress in older children or adults. Approximately 25% of persons who become chronically infected during childhood and 15% of those infected as adults will die of cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma.<sup>1,5,24</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>To reaffirm its 2009 recommendation on screening for HBV infection in pregnant women, the USPSTF commissioned a reaffirmation evidence update. The aim of this update is to identify substantial new evidence sufficient enough to change the prior recommendation. Case management is the standard intervention in the United States for all HBV-positive pregnant women. As a result, the USPSTF targeted its evidence review to focus on the effectiveness and potential harms of screening and the effectiveness and harms of case management to prevent perinatal transmission.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening Tests</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The primary screening test for detecting maternal HBV infection is the serologic detection of HBsAg. Serologic immunoassays for detecting HBsAg have a reported sensitivity and specificity greater than 98%.<sup>25,26</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>No studies were identified that directly assessed the benefits or harms of universal HBV screening during pregnancy. Two fair-quality observational studies reported perinatal transmission rates (primary outcome) over time.<sup>1,27,28</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One study reported outcomes of case management from 1994 to 2008 for 155,081 infants born to HBV-positive women in the national PHBPP, administered by the CDC.<sup>1,27</sup> From 1994 to 2008, the estimated number of infants born to HBV-positive women increased in the United States from 19,208 to 25,600 (<em>P</em> &lt; .001). The proportion of infants born to HBV-positive women enrolled in the PHBPP for case management also increased during this period, from 42.1% to 47.9% (<em>P</em> = .002). The number of infants receiving case management increased from 7415 in 1994 to 12,033 in 2008 (<em>P</em> &lt; .001).<sup>1,27</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perinatal transmission outcomes were reported for infants born from 1999 to 2008 who received serologic testing (n = 55,362). There was a statistically significant decrease in the perinatal transmission rate (<em>P</em> = .001). In 1999, 1.9% of infants who received serologic testing were infected with HBV; by 2008, the rate had decreased to 0.8% (<em>P</em> = .001).<sup>1,27</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second observational study was conducted in a large regional health care system in the United States (Kaiser Permanente Northern California).<sup>1,28</sup> The case management program reported on 4446 infants born to HBV-positive women from 1997 to 2010. More than 97% of the infants received HBV vaccination and HBIG prophylaxis within 12 hours of birth. Overall rates of perinatal transmission were very low (0.75%), and a decreasing trend in perinatal transmission was reported (incidence rate ratio, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.82-1.00]).<sup>1,28</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The results on historical trends from the observational studies are at risk of bias because of changes in case management program implementation, other interventions (eg, antiviral medication), cultural or secular changes (eg, universal vaccination), changes in reporting methods, and differences in data collection procedures.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>No studies were identified that reported the potential harms of universal HBV screening during pregnancy or case management. Screening has a low false-positive rate, and treatment is rarely harmful.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF considered the evidence using a reaffirmation process. The USPSTF previously found adequate evidence that serologic testing for HBsAg accurately identifies HBV infection. Interventions are effective for preventing perinatal transmission, based on foundational evidence and observational studies of US case management programs. In addition, there is evidence that over time, perinatal transmission has decreased among women and infants enrolled in case management, providing an overall substantial health benefit. Therefore, the USPSTF reaffirms its previous conclusion that there is convincing evidence that screening for HBV infection in pregnant women provides substantial benefit.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from January 8, 2019, to February 4, 2019. A majority of the comments wanted more information about treatment with antiviral therapy.

However, the randomized trial evidence focuses almost entirely on men aged 65 to 75 years. In this Recommendation Statement, the recommendations are stratified by &ldquo;men&rdquo; and &ldquo;women,&rdquo; although the net benefit estimates are driven by biologic sex (ie, male/female) rather than gender identity. Persons should consider their sex at birth to determine which recommendation best applies to them.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Assessment of Risk</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Important risk factors for AAA include older age, male sex, smoking, and having a first-degree relative with an AAA.<sup>13-16</sup> Other risk factors include a history of other vascular aneurysms, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, atherosclerosis, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension.<sup>17-19</sup> Factors associated with a reduced risk include African American race, Hispanic ethnicity, Asian ethnicity, and diabetes.<sup>13,20-24</sup> Risk factors for AAA rupture include older age, female sex, smoking, and elevated blood pressure.<sup>1</sup> Clinicians should consider the presence of comorbid conditions and not offering screening if patients are unable to undergo surgical intervention or have a reduced life expectancy.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4 align=\"left\">Smoking Status</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Epidemiologic literature commonly defines an &ldquo;ever smoker&rdquo; as someone who has smoked 100 or more cigarettes. Indirect evidence shows that smoking is the strongest predictor of AAA prevalence, growth, and rupture rates.<sup>1</sup> There is a dose-response relationship, as greater smoking exposure is associated with an increased risk for AAA.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h4 align=\"left\">Family History</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Family history of AAA in a first-degree relative doubles the risk of developing AAA.<sup>25</sup> The risk of developing an AAA is stronger with a female first-degree relative (odds ratio [OR], 4.32) than with a male first-degree relative (OR, 1.61).<sup>1,25</sup> However, evidence is lacking on whether persons with family history experience a different natural history or surgical outcomes than those without such a history.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Screening Tests</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The primary method of screening for AAA is conventional abdominal duplex ultrasonography.<sup>26</sup> Screening with ultrasonography is noninvasive, is simple to perform, has high sensitivity (94%-100%) and specificity (98%-100%) for detecting AAA,<sup>1,27-31</sup> and does not expose patients to radiation. Computed tomography is an accurate tool for identifying AAA; however, it is not recommended as a screening method because of the potential for harms from radiation exposure.<sup>1</sup> Physical examination has been used in practice but has low sensitivity (39%-68%) and specificity (75%) and is not recommended for screening.<sup>32</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Screening Intervals</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Evidence is adequate to support 1-time screening for men who have ever smoked. All of the population-based randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of AAA screening used a 1-time screening approach; 7 fair- to good-quality cohort studies and 1 fair-quality case-control study (n = 6785) show that AAA-associated mortality over 5 to 12 years is rare (&lt;3%) in men with initially normal results on ultrasonography (defined as an AAA &lt;3 cm in diameter).<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Treatment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Treatment of AAA depends on aneurysm size, the risk of rupture, and the risk of operative mortality. Larger size is associated with an increased risk of rupture. The annual risk for rupture is nearly 0% for persons with AAAs between 3.0 and 3.9 cm in diameter, 1% for those with AAAs between 4.0 and 4.9 cm in diameter, and 11% for those with AAAs between 5.0 and 5.9 cm in diameter.<sup>1</sup> Surgical repair is standard practice for men with an AAA of 5.5 cm or larger in diameter or an AAA larger than 4.0 cm in diameter that has rapidly increased in size (defined as an increase of 1.0 cm in diameter over a 1-year period). Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) has become the most common approach for elective AAA repair. Open repair is a time-tested, effective treatment for AAA. In the United States, 80% of intact AAA repairs and 52% of ruptured AAA repairs are performed using EVAR.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The majority of screen-detected AAAs (&ge;90%) are between 3.0 and 5.5 cm in diameter and thus below the usual threshold for surgery. The current standard of care for patients with stable smaller aneurysms is to maintain ultrasound surveillance at regular intervals because the risk of rupture is small. Recommended surveillance intervals for monitoring the growth of small AAAs vary across guideline groups, and adherence with surveillance guidelines has been reported to be as low as 65%.<sup>1</sup> Repairing smaller aneurysms with a lower risk of rupture increases the harms and reduces the benefits of screening.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>\r\n\r\n<h4 align=\"left\">Potential Preventable Burden</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The estimated prevalence of AAA in women is reportedly less than that in men.<sup>1</sup> The Chichester trial reported a prevalence in women that was one-sixth of the prevalence in men (1.3% vs 7.6%), and most AAA-related deaths occurred in women 80 years or older (70% vs &lt;50% in men).<sup>33</sup> In women, small AAAs have an increased risk of rupture, and rupture at an older age than in men.<sup>1</sup> Studies estimate that one-fourth to one-third of women have an AAA with a diameter below the current 5.5-cm threshold at the time of rupture.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h4 align=\"left\">Potential Harms</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Operative mortality associated with AAA is higher in women than in men. Women had higher 30-day mortality rates (2.31%) than men (1.37%) after EVAR procedures (OR, 1.67 [95% CI, 1.38-2.04]) and open repair (5.37% vs 2.82%; OR, 1.76 [95% CI, 1.35-2.30]).<sup>1,34</sup> Women also experience higher rates of other harms, such as major surgical complications and hospital readmission, after elective open repair or EVAR compared with men.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h4 align=\"left\">Current Practice</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Evidence is insufficient to accurately characterize current practice patterns related to screening for AAA in women.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The standard of care for elective repair is that patients with an AAA of 5.5 cm or larger in diameter should be referred for surgical intervention with either open repair or EVAR.<sup>1</sup> This recommendation is based on RCTs conducted in men. The AAA size needed for surgical intervention in women may differ. As a result, guidelines from the Society for Vascular Surgery recommend repairing AAAs between 5.0 and 5.4 cm in diameter in women.<sup>26</sup> However, concerns about poorer surgical outcomes in women, who have more complex anatomy and smaller blood vessels, have led some to caution against lowering the threshold for surgical intervention in women.<sup>1</sup></p><h2>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h2><p>This recommendation incorporates new evidence and replaces the 2014 USPSTF recommendation.<sup>35</sup> It is consistent with the 2014 USPSTF recommendation, which was a B recommendation for 1-time screening for AAA with ultrasonography in asymptomatic men aged 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked, a C recommendation for selective screening in men aged 65 to 75 years who have never smoked, a D recommendation against routine screening in asymptomatic women who have never smoked, and an I statement for women aged 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked.</p>","other":"<h2>Supporting Evidence</h2><h3 align=\"left\">Scope of Review</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF commissioned a systematic evidence review to update its 2014 recommendation on screening for AAA. The USPSTF examined evidence regarding the effectiveness of 1-time and repeated screening for AAA, the associated harms of screening, and the benefits and harms of available treatments for small AAAs (3.0-5.4 cm in diameter) identified through screening.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Accuracy of Screening Tests and Risk Assessment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">Ultrasonography is the primary method used to screen for AAA in primary care because of its high sensitivity (94%-100%) and specificity (98%-100%).<sup>1</sup> It is also noninvasive, is simple to perform, and does not expose patients to radiation.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Benefits of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n\r\n<h4 align=\"left\">Screening</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Four large, population-based RCTs (n = 134,271) that predominantly enrolled men 65 years or older examined the effectiveness of 1-time screening for AAA: the good-quality Multicenter Aneurysm Screening Study (MASS) (n = 67,800);<sup>36</sup>&nbsp;the good-quality Viborg County, Denmark, screening trial (n = 12,639);<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;the fair-quality Chichester, United Kingdom, screening trial (n = 15,382);<sup>37</sup>&nbsp;and the fair-quality Western Australia screening trial (n = 38,480).<sup>38</sup> Reported mean (or median) ages ranged from 67.7 to 72.6 years; the oldest participants were aged 83 years.<sup>1</sup> The Western Australia screening trial<sup>38</sup> reported outcomes by smoking status in the screened group. The trial was underpowered to detect differences in subpopulations. No comparisons in the unscreened group were reported.<sup>1,39</sup>&nbsp;None of the 4 population-based screening RCTs reported family history of AAA in the trial populations.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The prevalence of AAA in male screening participants ranged from 4.0% to 7.6% across the studies. Most screen-detected AAAs were small (&le;4 to 4.5 cm in diameter); 0.3% to 0.6% of screened participants had an AAA measuring 5 cm or larger or 5.5 cm or larger in diameter.<sup>1</sup> Two of the population-based screening trials analyzed AAA-associated mortality by age. The Viborg trial found similar risk reduction in AAA-related mortality in screening men aged 64 to 65 years compared with men aged 66 to 73 years.<sup>13</sup> The Western Australia trial found no AAA-associated mortality benefit in men aged 65 to 74 years (rate ratio, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.62-1.36]) at 12.8-year follow-up; results were similar to findings for men aged 64 to 83 years.<sup>1,38</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As noted previously, only the Chichester trial included women (aged 65-80 years). It found a low prevalence of AAA in women (1.3%), and 75% of screen-detected AAAs in women were 3.0 to 3.9 cm in diameter. Rupture rates (0.2% in both groups), AAA-specific mortality (0.06% vs 0.04% in both groups), and all-cause mortality (10.7% vs 10.2%) at 5 years did not statistically significantly differ between the invitation-to-screening and control groups.<sup>1,33</sup> The trial was underpowered to draw definitive conclusions about health outcomes in women. Although the risk for rupture at a smaller aneurysm diameter seems to be higher in women than in men,<sup>1,40</sup> the overall rupture rate in women is low. In the Chichester trial, more than two-thirds of deaths from AAA occurred in women 80 years or older.<sup>1,33</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pooled analysis of AAA-related mortality from the 4 trials showed a statistically significant 35% reduction associated with invitation to screening (Peto OR, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.57-0.74]; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 80%).<sup>1</sup> The number needed to screen was 305 men (95% CI, 248-411) to prevent 1 AAA death. The MASS and Viborg trials each found a statistically significant reduction in AAA-related mortality in the groups invited to screening compared with the control groups up to 13 years after screening (hazard ratio [HR], 0.58 [95% CI, 0.49-0.69] and 0.34 [95% CI, 0.20-0.57], respectively).<sup>13,36</sup> The Chichester trial reported an HR of less than 1 (HR, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.60-1.32]), but it was not statistically significant.<sup>1,37</sup> Pooled analysis of all available trials also showed no effect on all-cause mortality (relative risk, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.98-1.00]; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 0%).<sup>1</sup> Of the individual trials, only MASS showed a statistically significant benefit of screening for all-cause mortality at up to 15-year follow-up (HR, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.95-0.99]).<sup>1</sup> Invitation to screening was associated with a statistically significant reduced rate of rupture in the pooled analysis of the 4 trials (Peto OR, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.55-0.70]; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 53%).<sup>1</sup> The number needed to screen was 246 men (95% CI, 207-311) to prevent 1 AAA rupture. Pooled results of the trials showed a reduction in emergency surgery in the invited-to-screening group (Peto OR, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.48-0.68]; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 27%).<sup>1</sup> Screening 1000 men for AAA would decrease the number of emergency operations by 2 (95% CI, 2-2).<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h4 align=\"left\">Treatment</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Four trials evaluated early surgical intervention compared with surveillance of smaller aneurysms (4-5.4 cm in diameter).<sup>41-44</sup> Two good-quality open repair trials (n = 2226) and 2 fair-quality EVAR trials (n = 1088) showed no differences in all-cause and AAA-related mortality. However, there was a reduction in rupture rate with early open surgery compared with surveillance for small AAAs<sup>12,16,37,38</sup> in the Aneurysm Detection and Management (ADAM) Veterans Affairs trial (relative risk, 0.18 [95% CI, 0.04-0.81]) and the UK Small Aneurysm Trial (UKSAT) (relative risk, 0.51 [95% CI, 0.26-0.99]).<sup>1,41,42</sup> Individual patient data meta-analysis of the 2 early open vs surveillance trials (ADAM and UKSAT) reported no differences in all-cause mortality effect by sex or age.<sup>1,36,37</sup> The UKSAT trial reported no difference in all-cause mortality by smoking status; there were no analyses stratifying by family history or race/ethnicity.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seven pharmacotherapy RCTs (n = 1553) of antibiotics, antihypertensive medications (eg, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, and propranolol), and a mast cell stabilizer showed no significant effect on AAA growth compared with placebo.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Harms of Screening and Treatment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>An individual&rsquo;s risk for death related to elective surgery for AAA is lower than that related to emergency surgery for aneurysm rupture. However, the increase in the overall rates of detection and surgery in the screening groups still potentially represents a harm. The extent of overdiagnosis and overtreatment is difficult to estimate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each of the 4 older screening trials and a more recent population-based screening RCT (n = 18,614), the Viborg Vascular (VIVA) trial, showed an increase in elective operations in the intervention vs control group.<sup>1,45</sup> There were approximately 40% more operations in the invitation-to-screen group than in the control group (5 studies; n = 175,085; Peto OR, 1.44 [95% CI, 1.34-1.55]), driven primarily by an increase in elective operations (5 studies; n = 175,085; Peto OR, 1.75 [95% CI, 1.61-1.90]).<sup>1</sup> There was no statistically significant difference in 30-day mortality rates between the invited and control groups for either elective or emergency operations at 12- to 15-year follow-up.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Five studies (n = 2734) reported mixed results on quality-of-life outcomes.<sup>1</sup> Overall, there were no substantial differences on quality-of-life measures or anxiety or depression scores at up to 12 months of follow-up between patients who screened positive for an AAA and patients who screened negative or were unscreened.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two trials of early open repair vs surveillance (ADAM and UKSAT trials) reported a 50% higher rate of procedures in the early intervention group, with no difference in 30-day operative mortality.<sup>1,41,42</sup> Readmission rates at 30 days were similar, and major surgical complications were lower in the early intervention group. Analysis of quality-of-life measures showed mixed results; although there was generally a decline in both groups over time, there were no statistically significant differences between the groups for up to 1 to 2 years. Only the ADAM trial showed higher general health scores in the early repair group in the first 2 years, but this difference did not persist over time.<sup>1</sup> One trial reported an increased incidence of impotence in the early repair group at up to 4 years&rsquo; follow-up.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Registry harms data were generally comparable to the findings of the 2 trials, with the exception of reintervention rates, which were higher in the registries than in the ADAM trial.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two trials of early EVAR vs surveillance reported approximately 100% more procedures in the early intervention group and similarly rare 30-day operative mortality rates between the groups.<sup>1,43,44</sup> In the Comparison of Surveillance vs Aortic Endografting for Small Aneurysm Repair (CAESAR) trial, the early intervention group had a higher percentage of patients with any adverse events (19% vs 5%; <em>P</em> &lt; 0.01), any major morbidity related to repair at 30 days (18% vs 6%; <em>P</em> = 0.01), endoleaks at 1 year (12% vs 2%; <em>P</em> = 0.028), and reintervention (6% vs 0%; <em>P</em> = 0.03) but similar rates of any major morbidity over the trial duration (3.3% vs 2.8%; <em>P</em> = 0.99).<sup>1,43</sup> The Positive Impact of Endovascular Options for Treating Aneurysms Early (PIVOTAL) trial reported similar rates of adverse events at 30 days (12% vs 10%) and at 1 year (26% vs 35%), as well as reintervention (3.7% vs 4.6%).<sup>1,44</sup> Reported complication rates from registry data were generally comparable with rates reported in the above trials for 30-day operative mortality and reintervention.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two propranolol trials reported high discontinuation rates related to adverse events (38% and 60% of participants in the propranolol groups withdrew from the trials).

Some comments expressed concerns about the harms of screening. In response, the USPSTF added information about overtreatment as a harm of screening to the Supporting Evidence section and added information about comorbid conditions to the Practice Considerations section. Some comments urged more research in diverse populations. The USPSTF clarified its call for research in the Research Needs and Gaps section. Some comments suggested expanding the populations for whom screening is recommended. The USPSTF did not expand the scope of its recommendation beyond the populations justified by its review of the current evidence and recommends research about the benefits and harms of screening in these groups.</p><h2>Research Needs and Gaps</h2><p>Addressing several key research gaps could help inform the benefit of screening for AAA in US-based populations:<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Although evidence shows that women who smoke or have a family history are at increased risk for AAA compared with nonsmoking women without a family history, evidence is insufficient that screening this population confers a net benefit. Ideally, appropriately powered RCTs among women with risk factors could answer these critical gaps in the evidence on screening for AAA. In the absence of new trial data, high-quality, well-calibrated modeling studies based on reliable data on the harms and benefits of screening in women who smoke or in men and women with a family history of AAA may be informative.</li>\r\n\t<li>Well-conducted cohort studies examining rescreening benefits (including growth rates and health outcomes) are needed for persons who initially screen negative for AAA to determine the benefit and timing of additional screening ultrasonography.</li>\r\n\t<li>External validation of risk prediction models that have already been developed will allow policy makers to assess their value for making more individualized screening recommendations.</li>\r\n\t<li>Epidemiologic studies on the current prevalence of AAA in the United States, including in subpopulations, would help inform the applicability of older population-based screening trials to the current US population.</li>\r\n\t<li>Well-designed studies, RCTs, or registry data on the thresholds for repair of AAA in women may inform the benefits and harms of screening in women, as evidence suggests that AAAs in women may rupture at a smaller size than in men.</li>\r\n\t<li>Studies examining systems approaches to improving implementation of evidence-based AAA screening in the United States are needed.</li>\r\n\t<li>Studies examining the efficacy of screening and treatment in diverse populations (eg, older adults, women, and racial/ethnic groups) are needed to inform the need for specific recommendations in subpopulations of Americans.</li>\r\n</ul><h2>Recommendations of Others</h2><p>The American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association jointly recommend 1-time screening for AAA with physical examination and ultrasonography in men aged 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked or in men 60 years or older who are the sibling or offspring of a person with AAA. These organizations do not recommend screening for AAA in men who have never smoked or in women.<sup>46</sup> The Society for Vascular Surgery recommends 1-time ultrasonography screening for AAA in all men and women aged 65 to 75 years with a history of tobacco use, men 55 years or older with a family history of AAA, and women 65 years or older who have smoked or have a family history of AAA.<sup>47</sup> The American College of Preventive Medicine recommends 1-time screening in men aged 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked; it does not recommend routine screening in women.<sup>48</sup></p>","topic":"Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm: Screening","keywords":"AAA|Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm","pubDate":"2019-12-10","categories":["5"],"tool":["239","240"]},"422":{"topicType":"Screening","topicYear":2019,"uspstfAlias":"asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-adults-screening","specific":[513,514],"title":"Asymptomatic Bacteriuria in Adults: Screening","rationale":"<h2>Importance</h2><p>Asymptomatic bacteriuria is defined as the presence of bacteria in the urine of a person without signs or symptoms of a urinary tract infection.<sup>1</sup> Among the general adult population, women (across all ages) have the highest prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria, although rates increase with age among both men and women.<sup>2</sup> The reported prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria ranges from 1% to 6% among premenopausal women to 22% among women older than 90 years.<sup>3,4</sup> Asymptomatic bacteriuria is present in an estimated 2% to 10% of pregnant women.<sup>5</sup> The condition is rare in men.<sup>4,6</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>During pregnancy, physiologic changes that affect the urinary tract increase the risk of asymptomatic bacteriuria and symptomatic urinary tract infections, including pyelonephritis (a urinary tract infection in which one or both kidneys become infected).<sup>7</sup> Pyelonephritis is one of the most common nonobstetric reasons for hospitalization in pregnant women.<sup>8</sup> Pyelonephritis is associated with perinatal complications including septicemia, respiratory distress, low birth weight, and spontaneous preterm birth.<sup>9</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The presence of asymptomatic bacteriuria has not been shown to increase the risk of adverse health outcomes among nonpregnant persons.<sup>6,10</sup></p><h2>USPSTF Assessment of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h2><h3 align=\"left\">Pregnant Persons</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF concluded with moderate certainty that screening for and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant persons has <strong>moderate net benefit</strong> in reducing perinatal complications (<a href=\"#tab\">Table</a>).

It does not apply to persons who have chronic medical or urinary tract conditions, such as end-stage renal disease; have indwelling urinary catheters, urinary stents, or spinal cord injuries; are hospitalized; reside in an institution (eg, a nursing home); or who are transplant recipients.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Definition of Asymptomatic Bacteriuria</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Asymptomatic bacteriuria occurs when the urinary tract is colonized with significant amounts of pathogenic bacteria, primarily from the gastrointestinal tract, in the absence of symptoms or signs of a urinary tract infection. The most common pathogen is <em>Escherichia coli</em>, although other bacteria such as <em>Klebsiella</em>, <em>Proteus mirabilis</em>, and group B streptococcus can be involved.<sup>4,11</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Assessment of Risk</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The risk of developing asymptomatic bacteriuria varies by age, sex, and pregnancy status.<sup>6</sup> Because of the location and length of the female urethra, women are predisposed to infections of the urinary tract, including asymptomatic bacteriuria.<sup>5</sup> Physiologic changes in both pregnant and older women increase the risk of asymptomatic bacteriuria and a urinary tract infection.<sup>7,11,12</sup> In general, men are at low risk of developing asymptomatic bacteriuria, although rates increase with older age.<sup>12</sup> Persons with diabetes are also at increased risk of developing asymptomatic bacteriuria.<sup>4,6</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Screening Tests</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria during pregnancy is done with a urine culture at 12 to 16 weeks of gestation or at the first prenatal visit. Urine culture is currently recommended for screening in pregnancy and is the established method for diagnosis.<sup>2</sup> A culture obtained using a midstream, clean-catch urine sample with greater than 100,000 colony-forming units (CFU) per milliliter of a single uropathogen is considered a positive test result.<sup>6</sup> Greater than 10,000 CFU/mL of group B streptococcus is an indicator of vaginal colonization and is commonly used as the threshold for treatment of infection in pregnancy.<sup>13</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Screening Intervals</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In general, screening is performed once at the first prenatal visit per clinical guidelines. However, there is little evidence on the optimal timing and frequency of screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy.<sup>2</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Treatment or Interventions</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Pregnant persons with asymptomatic bacteriuria usually receive antibiotic therapy, based on urine culture results and follow-up monitoring. The choice of antibacterial regimen for treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria during pregnancy is based on safety in pregnancy and patterns of antimicrobial resistance in the particular setting.<sup>6,7</sup></p><h2>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h2><p>In this update, the USPSTF continues to recommend screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant persons with urine culture and recommends against screening in nonpregnant adults. The USPSTF changed the grade for pregnant persons from an &ldquo;A&rdquo; to a &ldquo;B&rdquo; based on the reduced applicability of the previous evidence that included outdated antibiotic treatment regimens and newer evidence that shows a significantly lower risk of pyelonephritis than found in previous reviews. In addition, there are newer concerns about antibiotic use, such as antimicrobial resistance and adverse changes to the microbiome (not addressed in current studies), leading to an increase in the magnitude of potential harms. These factors led the USPSTF to reduce assessments of certainty and magnitude of benefit, resulting in the change of grade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since 1996, the USPSTF has maintained an &ldquo;A&rdquo; recommendation for 1-time screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria with urine culture in pregnant persons between 12 and 16 weeks of gestation. The original 1996 recommendation was reaffirmed in 2004 and again in 2008.<sup>14-16</sup> In 1996, the USPSTF found that there was insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening in older adult women or women with diabetes and, in a separate recommendation, that screening was not recommended in other asymptomatic adults or older adults who reside in an institution.<sup>14</sup> In 2004, these recommendations were combined into a single recommendation against screening, which was subsequently reaffirmed in 2008.<sup>15,16</sup></p>","other":"<h2>Supporting Evidence</h2><h3 align=\"left\">Scope of Review</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF commissioned a systematic evidence review to evaluate the evidence on the potential benefits and harms of screening for and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in community-dwelling adults, including pregnant persons.<sup>2,17</sup> This review was used to update the 2008 USPSTF recommendation statement.<sup>16</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Evidence on Benefits of Screening and Treatment</h3>\r\n\r\n<h4 align=\"left\">Pregnant Persons</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Two observational cohort studies conducted in Spain and Turkey between 1987 and 1999<sup>18,19</sup> (n = 5289) examined outcomes in screened and unscreened pregnant women. Both studies included patients screened at the first prenatal visit with urine culture and treated on detection of asymptomatic bacteriuria. In both studies, few cases of pyelonephritis developed in women in either cohort. Only one of the studies reported additional outcomes, including infant birth weight, prematurity, intrauterine death, and intrauterine growth restriction, although the study was not adequately powered to detect differences in these outcomes.<sup>2,18</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Twelve trials of pregnant women (n = 2377) screened for asymptomatic bacteriuria and randomized to either a treatment or control condition (placebo or no treatment) were included in the review.<sup>20-31</sup> Most studies were conducted in hospital-based obstetrics-gynecology clinics. Seven studies reported screening at the first prenatal visit, 2 studies reported the specific gestational age at which screening was performed, and 3 studies did not report the timing of screening.<sup>2</sup> All but 2 studies were published in the 1960s or 1970s, with the most recent studies published in 1987 and 2015.<sup>25,31</sup>&nbsp;In the older studies, there was sparse reporting on many patient characteristics such as age and race/ethnicity. In addition, treatment regimens for screen-detected asymptomatic bacteriuria varied according to the medication used, timing, duration, and dosage. Antibiotics were used in all studies except 1, although several antibiotics tested in the trials are no longer recommended for treatment of urinary tract infections in pregnancy.<sup>2</sup> Rates of pyelonephritis in the control groups were considerably higher in the 10 older studies than in the 2 more recent ones (7% to 36% vs 2.2% and 2.5%, respectively). Lower rates of pyelonephritis in newer studies suggests that the magnitude of benefit from screening may be reduced relative to screening in earlier cohorts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Patients in the control groups had higher rates of pyelonephritis than those in the treatment groups in all but one of the studies.<sup>25</sup> Pooled analysis demonstrated a 76% reduction in pyelonephritis among the intervention groups (pooled relative risk [RR], 0.24 [95% CI, 0.14-0.40]; 12 studies; n = 2068).<sup>2</sup> A sensitivity analysis that removed studies deemed to have high risk of bias demonstrated a similar risk reduction (pooled RR, 0.19 [95% CI, 0.11-0.34]; 7 studies; n = 1184).<sup>2</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seven treatment studies reported on the incidence of low birth weight. The pooled analysis found statistically significant reductions in the incidence of infants with low birth weight (pooled RR, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.46-0.90]; 7 studies; n = 1522).<sup>2</sup> Preterm birth and perinatal mortality were reported in 3 and 6 studies, respectively. For both outcomes, results were mixed and pooled estimates did not demonstrate statistical significance.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4 align=\"left\">Nonpregnant Adults</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>No studies were identified that directly evaluated the benefits of screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in the general adult population. Five trials (n = 777)<sup>32-36</sup> addressed the benefits of treatment of screen-detected asymptomatic bacteriuria in general adult populations. All 5 studies included participants who had 2 consecutive positive screening urine cultures using a midstream, clean-catch urine sample and using a cutoff of greater than 100,000 CFU/mL. Across all studies, 84% to 100% of participants were women. One study included women aged 20 to 65 years without diabetes, 1 study included only women with diabetes (mean age, 55 years), and 3 studies included only older patients living in independent living facilities. In general, characteristics of participants were sparsely reported across studies, with none reporting on race/ethnicity. Treatment varied across trials, ranging from a single dose to 3 months of antibiotics. No study found a difference in the rates of symptomatic infections or mortality between treated and untreated groups.<sup>2</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Evidence on Harms of Screening and Treatment</h3>\r\n\r\n<h4 align=\"left\">Pregnant Persons</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>One cohort study (n = 186) that compared screened and unscreened pregnant women reported on potential harms (congenital abnormalities) associated with the screening program, with no meaningful differences reported.<sup>18</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seven studies reported on harms associated with treatment of screen-detected asymptomatic bacteriuria.<sup>20,22-24,28,29,31</sup> Five studies (n = 961) reported on congenital malformations. All but 1 study reported fewer cases in the intervention group, although the number of cases was small and pooled estimates were not statistically significant.<sup>2</sup> Other infant or fetal harms, such as jaundice (2 studies), respiratory distress (1 study), and neonatal sepsis (1 study) were sparsely reported and event rates were low, which limited comparisons.<sup>2</sup> Adverse reactions to medications were reported in 2 studies; vaginitis and diarrhea were associated with ampicillin, and nausea and rashes were reported with use of nalidixic acid and nitrofurantoin.<sup>2</sup> Complications of pregnancy and delivery (such as third-trimester hemorrhage, premature rupture of the membranes, nonspontaneous onset of labor, or cesarean delivery before onset of labor) were inconsistently and sparsely reported, limiting any conclusions.<sup>2</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h4 align=\"left\">Nonpregnant Adults</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Two studies of treatment in nonpregnant women<sup>34,36</sup> and 2 studies in older adults<sup>32,35</sup> reported on rates of adverse events associated with treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria. Overall, harms were not reported consistently, which limited the conclusions that could be drawn from the current evidence base.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No studies were identified that addressed the harms of screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in nonpregnant adults.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The relationship between asymptomatic bacteriuria and adverse pregnancy outcomes is related to a combination of factors. Women are at increased risk of urinary tract infections, including asymptomatic bacteriuria, because of the anatomical placement of the urethra.<sup>2</sup> Conditions such as increased blood glucose levels and urinary stasis (in which the bladder is unable to completely empty) can increase risk for symptomatic urinary tract infections and pyelonephritis. Pregnancy further increases the risk because of changes in urine pH, bladder compression, and urethral dilation.<sup>37</sup> Pyelonephritis in pregnancy has been associated with worse pregnancy outcomes.<sup>9,37,38</sup> Screening for and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant persons could prevent cases of pyelonephritis and associated negative pregnancy outcomes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Antibiotics are the mainstay treatment for urinary tract infections, but there are consequences to their use. The use of antibiotics is known to lead to antimicrobial resistance. In addition, there is emerging evidence that bacterial colonization of the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts plays a protective role. Antibiotic use can disrupt these effects.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from April 23 through May 20, 2019. Commenters requested more information about how the USPSTF assessed older evidence. The USPSTF recognizes that older studies have certain limitations. However, in reviewing all available evidence on the benefits and harms of treating screen-detected asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant women, the USPSTF found the evidence to be adequate. Several comments sought clarification on the USPSTF&rsquo;s rationale for changing the grade of the recommendation from an &ldquo;A&rdquo; to a &ldquo;B&rdquo; for pregnant persons. A change in grade may occur when evidence has increased or decreased and results in a change in the certainty or magnitude of net benefit.<sup>39</sup> Newer evidence, such as the lower prevalence of pyelonephritis and a better understanding of the harms associated with antibiotic use, changed the USPSTF&rsquo;s assessment of both the certainty (from high to moderate certainty) and net benefit of screening (from substantial to moderate net benefit), leading to the grade change.</p><h2>Research Needs and Gaps</h2><p>The USPSTF identified several gaps in the evidence where more research is needed:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>There were few studies that examined asymptomatic bacteriuria and risk of serious outcomes (ie, pyelonephritis or urosepsis) in modern pregnant populations. Epidemiologic evidence suggests that the prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria has been low in recent decades, and many antibiotics used in older studies are no longer recommended for use in pregnancy. More observational studies examining this would help improve the applicability of the evidence base.</li>\r\n\t<li>Clinical trials, observational studies, and natural experiments in settings where asymptomatic bacteriuria screening and treatment are not the standard of care or where guidelines are changing would be useful in assessing benefits and harms.</li>\r\n\t<li>Newer understandings of the human microbiome suggest that bacterial colonization may play a protective role in both mothers and babies. For pregnant and nonpregnant populations, research is needed to better understand the microbiology of a healthy urinary tract and the natural history of asymptomatic bacteriuria.</li>\r\n\t<li>The role of current patterns of antibiotic use in the epidemiology of asymptomatic bacteriuria is unclear. Antibiotic use increases the risk of antimicrobial resistance and can change the microbiome. More research is needed to better understand potential harms of treatment and the effects of antibiotic use on newborn, child, and longer-term health.</li>\r\n</ul><h2>Recommendations of Others</h2><p>The Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant women and treatment for those who screen positive.<sup>40</sup> The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists endorses the Infectious Diseases Society of America&rsquo;s recommendations for screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant women and treatment for those who screen positive. The Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care recommends screening in pregnant women with urine culture once during the first trimester, although this was issued as a &ldquo;weak&rdquo; recommendation and the quality of evidence was considered low.<sup>41</sup> The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has no specific recommendation to screen for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant persons. However, the AAP recommends that clinicians treat pregnant persons and perform a test of cure if asymptomatic bacteriuria is found to be present on a urine culture. In 2008, the American Academy of Family Physicians recommended screening in pregnant women at 12 to 16 weeks of gestation or at the first prenatal visit, whichever comes first.<sup>42</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The AAP, the American Academy of Family Physicians, and the United Kingdom&rsquo;s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence all recommend against screening for and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in nonpregnant adults.<sup>42-44</sup> The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends against screening for and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in nonpregnant, premenopausal women.<sup>45</sup></p>","topic":"Asymptomatic Bacteriuria in Adults: Screening","keywords":"Bacteriuria|Urinary Tract infection|Pyelonephritis|Perinatal morbidity/mortality|Maternal morbidity/mortality|Fetal morbidity/mortality|Cystitis|Urine Culture|Dipstick testing|Dipslide testing","pubDate":"2019-09-24","categories":["11","2"],"tool":["241","243","242"]},"423":{"topicType":"Screening","topicYear":2020,"uspstfAlias":"hepatitis-c-screening","specific":[524],"title":"Hepatitis C Virus Infection in Adolescents and Adults: Screening","rationale":"<h2>Importance</h2><p>Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the most common chronic blood-borne pathogen in the US and a leading cause of complications from chronic liver disease.<sup>1</sup> Hepatitis C virus infection is associated with more deaths than the top 60 other reportable infectious diseases combined, including HIV.<sup>2</sup> The most important risk factor for HCV infection is past or current injection drug use.<sup>1</sup> In the US, an estimated 4.1 million persons have past or current HCV infection (ie, they test positive for the anti-HCV antibody).

The most important risk factor for HCV infection is past or current injection drug use. In the US, recent increases in HCV incidence have predominantly been among young persons who inject drugs (PWID).<sup>1,9</sup> Approximately one-third of PWID aged 18 to 30 years are infected with HCV, and 70% to 90% of older PWID are infected.<sup>9</sup> Clinicians may want to consider screening in adolescents younger than 18 years and in adults older than 79 years who are at high risk (eg, past or current injection drug use).</p>\r\n<p>Pregnant adults should be screened. HCV prevalence has doubled in women aged 15 to 44 years from 2006 to 2014.<sup>1,10,11</sup> From 2011 to 2014, 0.73% of pregnant women tested had an HCV infection, with a 68% increase in the proportion of infants born to HCV-infected mothers.<sup>1,10</sup> Approximately 1700 infected infants are born annually to 29,000 HCV-infected mothers.<sup>1,11</sup> Because of the increasing prevalence of HCV in women aged 15 to 44 years and in infants born to HCV-infected mothers, clinicians may want to consider screening pregnant persons younger than 18 years.</p>\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>Screening with anti-HCV antibody testing followed by polymerase chain reaction testing for HCV RNA is accurate for identifying patients with chronic HCV infection.<sup>9</sup> Currently, diagnostic evaluations are often performed with various noninvasive tests that have lower risk for harm than liver biopsy for diagnosing fibrosis stage or cirrhosis in persons who screen positive.<sup>12</sup></p>\r\n<p>Among patients with abnormal results on liver function tests (measurement of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, or bilirubin levels) who were tested for reasons other than HCV screening, finding the cause of the abnormality often includes testing for HCV infection and is considered case finding rather than screening; therefore, it is outside the scope of this recommendation.</p>\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Screening Intervals</h3>\r\n<p>Most adults need to be screened only once. Persons with continued risk for HCV infection (eg, PWID) should be screened periodically. There is limited information about the specific screening interval that should occur in persons who continue to be at risk for new HCV infection or how pregnancy changes the need for additional screening.</p>\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Screening Implementation</h3>\r\n<p>Important considerations for implementation of screening include (1) communicating to patients that screening is voluntary and undertaken only with the patient&rsquo;s knowledge and understanding that HCV screening is planned; (2) informing patients about HCV infection, how it can (and cannot) be acquired, the meaning of positive and negative test results, and the benefits and harms of treatment; and (3) providing patients the opportunity to ask questions and to decline screening.</p>\r\n<p>Some health care systems serving insured populations, some academic medical centers, and the Veterans Health Administration have achieved high rates of HCV screening and treatment. However, national HCV screening rates in community health centers and from the National Health Interview Study were 8.3% and 17.3%, respectively; 1 study of 4 safety-net primary care practices serving low-income and uninsured or underserved populations found that only 0.8% of persons born in 1945 through 1965 were screened over a 1-year period.<sup>13</sup> Implementation of successful screening may require addressing various barriers to screening and treatment in diverse populations, such as the uninsured.</p>\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The purpose of antiviral treatment regimens for HCV infection is to prevent long-term health complications of chronic HCV infection (eg, cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma).</p>\r\n<p>Currently, all oral direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimens without interferon have been accepted as the standard treatment for chronic HCV infection. Antiviral therapy is not generally considered during pregnancy because of the lack of data on the safety of newer DAA regimens during pregnancy and breastfeeding.<sup>14,15</sup></p>\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Additional Tools and Resources</h3>\r\n<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides strategies for implementing a testing program and additional risk factors at <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/hcv/guidelinesc.htm\">https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/hcv/guidelinesc.htm</a>.<sup>16</sup></p>\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Other Related USPSTF Recommendations</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF has made recommendations on screening for hepatitis B virus infection in pregnant persons,<sup>17</sup> screening for hepatitis B virus infection in adults,<sup>18</sup> and screening for HIV infection.<sup>19</sup></p><h2>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h2><p>This recommendation incorporates new evidence and replaces the 2013 USPSTF recommendation, which recommended screening for HCV infection in persons at high risk for infection and 1-time screening in adults born between 1945 and 1965 (B recommendation).<sup>20</sup> The new USPSTF recommendation expands the ages for screening to all adults from 18 to 79 years.</p>\r\n<p>The treatment of HCV continues to evolve, resulting in greater benefits and fewer harms than when the USPSTF last considered the evidence. Direct-acting antiviral regimens are of shorter duration, with higher rates of sustained virologic response (SVR) and fewer serious harms than previous treatment regimens. Since 2013, the prevalence of HCV infection has increased in younger persons aged 20 to 39 years. There are limited epidemiologic data available on HCV incidence in adolescents younger than 18 years. The HCV infection prevalence rates in older adults born between 1945 and 1965 remain relatively high, and prevalence in the elderly will increase as this population ages. Clinical trials of DAA treatment included adults in their early 80s, which increases the evidence for the benefits of screening in older adults. In addition, many older adults could experience the benefits of screening. As a result, the USPSTF concluded that broadening the age for HCV screening beyond its previous recommendation will identify infected patients at earlier stages of disease who could greatly benefit from effective treatment before developing complications.</p>","other":"<h2>Supporting Evidence</h2><h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF commissioned a systematic evidence review to update its prior review (from 2013) on screening for HCV infection.<sup>20,21</sup> The scope of this review is similar to that of the prior systematic review, except in the current review, the USPSTF also examined the evidence on adolescents.<sup>21</sup> For treatment, the USPSTF focused on currently recommended DAA regimens.</p>\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Accuracy of Screening Tests and Risk Assessment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF previously found HCV screening to be highly accurate.<sup>20</sup> The USPSTF found no new evidence on the yield of repeat vs 1-time screening or alternative screening strategies (eg, different risk- or prevalence-based methods).</p>\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Benefits of Early Detection or Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no direct evidence on the benefits of HCV screening vs no screening on health outcomes or the effects of prenatal HCV screening on the risk of vertical transmission.<sup>1</sup> Treatment studies focused on populations without cirrhosis who are more likely to be asymptomatic and identified by screening. Of the trials of DAA regimens (n = 7167; 26% to 69% female; mean age, 45 to 62 years), 14 were multinational; 11 were conducted in the US or Canada; and the remainder were conducted in New Zealand, Egypt, France, or Asia. In 29 trials, 60% to 100% of patients were white.<sup>1</sup> The trials evaluated a variety of DAA regimens recommended in current guidelines. Treatment duration was 12 weeks in all but 2 trials, which allocated patients to either 8 or 12 weeks of treatment. Eleven trials were of good quality and 22 were of fair quality. Forty-nine trials found DAA regimens to be associated with pooled SVR rates ranging from 95.5% to 98.9% across genotypes. Evidence was greatest for genotype 1 infection (32 trials), the most frequent genotype in the US.<sup>1</sup> Sustained virologic response rates were similar in trials that stratified patients according to age, sex, race/ethnicity, or treatment experience with non-DAA regimens.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<p>Direct evidence on the effects of current DAA regimens on health outcomes is limited.<sup>1</sup> Pooled analysis from 10 trials found small, short-term improvements in quality of life scale scores after treatment with a DAA regimen compared with baseline scores.<sup>1</sup> Trials reporting short-term mortality (&lt;1 year) found few events and were not designed to detect differences in mortality rates. Twenty-one trials reported no deaths; in the other 10 trials, there were 17 deaths (0.4% [17/3848] overall).<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF review evaluated the linkage between achieving SVR after antiviral therapy vs no SVR and health outcomes. Sustained virologic response after antiviral therapy was consistently associated with decreased risk of all-cause mortality (13 studies; pooled hazard ratio [HR], 0.40 [95% CI, 0.28-0.56]), liver mortality (4 studies; pooled HR, 0.11 [95% CI, 0.04-0.27]), cirrhosis (4 cohorts in 3 studies; pooled HR, 0.36 [95% CI, 0.33-0.40]), and hepatocellular carcinoma (20 studies; pooled HR, 0.29 [95% CI, 0.23-0.38]) vs no SVR, after adjustment for potential confounders.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found limited new evidence on the risk of vertical transmission. Five observational studies found no clear association between risk of vertical transmission of HCV infection and the mode of delivery.<sup>21</sup> One good-quality US study showed that prolonged rupture of membranes (&gt;6 hours) was associated with increased risk of HCV transmission in 189 mother-infant pairs compared with membrane rupture lasting less than 6 hours (adjusted odds ratio, 9.3 [95% CI, 1.5-180]).<sup>1,22</sup> One observational study in 188 mother-infant pairs found that internal fetal monitoring was associated with an increased risk of vertical transmission of HCV infection compared with external monitoring (adjusted odds ratio, 6.7 [95% CI, 1.1-35.9]).<sup>1,22</sup> Three observational studies did not find a clear association between breastfeeding and an increased risk of vertical transmission of HCV infection.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<p>The evidence is also limited in adolescents. Seven trials (n = 300) reported SVR rates in adolescents taking DAA regimens similar to those taken by adults (97%-100%).<sup>1</sup> However, some of the trials evaluated regimens that are not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use in adolescents.<sup>1</sup> Direct-acting antiviral regimens recommended and approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use in adolescents are ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, sofosbuvir/ribavirin, and glecaprevir/pibrentasvir.<sup>1</sup> The evidence on antiviral treatment and health outcomes in adolescents is very limited. One post hoc before-and-after analysis found that scores based on the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (ie, school and social functioning) improved from baseline to 24 weeks after treatment with a DAA regimen.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<p>Modeling studies that compared screening in all persons 18 years and older with birth cohort screening suggested that expanded screening strategies would be beneficial, despite different assumptions regarding chronic HCV infection progression and rates of linkage to care.<sup>1</sup> One analysis of a hypothetical cohort of the US population used more conservative assumptions and found that screening everyone 18 years and older would identify an estimated 256,000 additional HCV cases and lead to an estimated 280,000 additional individuals who achieve SVR and an estimated 4400 fewer cases of hepatocellular carcinoma over a lifetime.<sup>1,23</sup></p>\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Harms of Screening or Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF did not identify any new studies providing direct evidence on screening harms. Poor-quality evidence from the prior review suggested potential negative psychological and social effects from HCV screening.<sup>1,24</sup></p>\r\n<p>Direct-acting antiviral regimens are associated with fewer harms than older interferon-containing therapies. Treatment duration has shortened from 24 to 48 weeks with older interferon-containing regimens to 8 to 12 weeks.<sup>1</sup> In DAA trials (33 trials; n = 7167) with adverse event data, the pooled rate of any adverse event was 73.3%.<sup>1</sup> Rates of serious adverse events (1.9%) and withdrawal due to adverse events (0.4%) were low compared with rates reported for interferon-containing regimens.<sup>1</sup> Pooled rates of specific adverse events ranged from 2.4% for anemia to 18.4% for headache and were also lower when compared with rates reported for older interferon-containing therapies.<sup>1</sup> The most common adverse events were fatigue, headache, nausea, and diarrhea.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<p>Seven nonrandomized, open-label trials (n = 300) in adolescents examined treatment harms. Five trials reported no withdrawals due to adverse events; 1 trial reported a serious adverse event (grade 3 joint injury). The rate of any adverse event was 27% in 1 trial and 71% to 84% in 4 trials. Specific adverse event rates across trials ranged from 3% to 48% for headache (7 trials), 5% to 53% for fatigue (7 trials), and 3% to 28% for gastrointestinal adverse events (nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea) (5 trials).<sup>1</sup> Three trials reported no deaths in adolescents (n = 182) treated with DAA regimens.<sup>1</sup> These trials were not designed to evaluate long-term harms associated with DAA treatment during adolescence.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from August 27 to September 23, 2019. Some comments asked for a definition of &ldquo;high risk&rdquo;; however, an extensive list of risk factors is beyond the scope of this recommendation statement. The Additional Tools and Resources section provides a link to other resources. Some comments expressed concern about the lack of guidance on screening intervals for pregnant adults. In response, the USPSTF added language to the Practice Considerations section. Some comments raised concerns about implementation. In response, the USPSTF added language about counseling and consent to the Screening Implementation section. Some comments urged more research on the benefits and harms of treatment in pregnant adults. The USPSTF clarified its call for research in pregnant persons in the Research Needs and Gaps section.</p><h2>Research Needs and Gaps</h2><p>Addressing several key research gaps could help inform the benefit of screening for HCV infection in US-based populations:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Research is needed on the yield of repeat vs 1-time screening for HCV and different repeat screening intervals to inform recommendations on optimal screening intervals for persons at high risk.</li>\r\n<li>Research is needed to identify labor management practices (eg, prolonged rupture of membranes or use of internal fetal monitoring) and treatment of HCV infection prior to pregnancy to reduce the risk of mother-to-child transmission. Research is also needed on the benefits and harms of additional screening during pregnancy for low-risk persons who have been previously screened.</li>\r\n<li>Trials and cohort studies that measure effects on quality of life, function, and extrahepatic effects of HCV infection (eg, renal function, cardiovascular effects, or diabetes) would be helpful for evaluating the effects of DAA regimens on short-term health outcomes.</li>\r\n<li>Additional studies are needed to examine the epidemiology of HCV infection and the effectiveness of DAA regimens in adolescents.</li>\r\n</ul><h2>Recommendations of Others</h2><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is in the process of updating its HCV screening guidelines. Its draft screening guideline recommends screening for HCV at least once in a lifetime for all adults 18 years and older, except in settings where the prevalence is less than 0.1%. All pregnant persons should be screened for HCV during each pregnancy, except in settings where the prevalence of HCV infection is less than 0.1%. All persons with risk factors (eg, persons with HIV, prior recipients of blood transfusions, persons who ever injected drugs and shared needles, and persons who are born to an HCV-infected mother) should be tested for HCV, with periodic testing while risk factors persist.<sup>25</sup> The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends offering HCV screening to pregnant persons with risk factors.<sup>26</sup> The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends 1-time routine, opt-out HCV screening for all persons 18 years and older and 1-time testing for all persons younger than 18 years at increased risk of HCV exposure. They also recommend periodic testing for persons with an increased risk of HCV exposure and annual HCV testing for all PWID and for HIV-infected men who have unprotected sex with men.<sup>27</sup></p>","topic":"Hepatitis C Virus Infection in Adolescents and Adults: Screening","keywords":"Hepatitis C","pubDate":"2020-03-02","categories":["11"],"tool":["244","248","247","246","245"]},"425":{"topicType":"Preventive medication","topicYear":2019,"uspstfAlias":"ocular-prophylaxis-for-gonococcal-ophthalmia-neonatorum-preventive-medication","specific":[447],"title":"Ocular Prophylaxis for Gonococcal Ophthalmia Neonatorum: Preventive Medication","rationale":"<h2>Rationale</h2><h3 align=\"left\">Importance</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In the United States, the rate of gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum was an estimated 0.4 cases per 100,000 live births per year from 2013 to 2017.<sup>1-4</sup> Gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum can cause corneal scarring, ocular perforation, and blindness as early as 24 hours after birth.<sup>5-7</sup> In the absence of ocular prophylaxis, transmission rates of gonococcal infection from mother to newborn are 30% to 50%.<sup>8</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Reaffirmation</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2011, the USPSTF reviewed the evidence on prophylactic ocular topical medication for all newborns to prevent gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum and issued an A recommendation.<sup>5</sup> The USPSTF has decided to use a reaffirmation deliberation process to update this recommendation.

While screening and treatment programs have reduced the rates of gonorrhea in pregnant women, there are large disparities in access to prenatal care in the United States.<sup>1,12</sup> Risk-based prophylaxis has also been proposed as an alternative strategy for preventing gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum.

Several European countries, including Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom, no longer require universal prophylaxis, instead opting for a prevention strategy of increased screening and treatment of pregnant women.<sup>22</sup> In 2017, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommended screening all pregnant women at risk for gonorrhea or who live in a high-prevalence area at the first prenatal visit; women with gonococcal infection should be retested in 3 to 6 months, preferably in the third trimester.

Gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum occurs when gonococcal infection is transmitted to newborns during delivery by women infected with <em>N gonorrhoeae</em>.<sup>10</sup> The rates of gonococcal conjunctivitis in infants are directly related to the rates of gonorrhea among women of reproductive age.<sup>3</sup> In the United States, adolescents and young adult women have the highest rates of gonorrhea, with rates peaking at age 19 years (872.2 cases per 100,000 women); among women aged 20 to 24 years, there were 648.8 cases per 100,000 women in 2017.<sup>1</sup> Estimated rates of gonorrhea among pregnant women in the US primary care setting are not available. Although gonococcal infection rates have declined since national screening programs were implemented in the 1970s, reported gonorrhea cases have increased recently, from 105.3 cases to 171.9 cases per 100,000 population from 2013 to 2017, respectively.<sup>1</sup> An estimated 6.2% of births in the United States occur among women receiving little to no prenatal care, although rates as high as 20% have been documented in certain populations based on location and race/ethnicity.<sup>12</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Data based on infant age (younger than 1 year) and specimen source (conjunctiva or eye) indicate there were an estimated 42 infections (&le;0.4 cases) per 100,000 live births per year from 2013 to 2017.<sup>1</sup> However, limitations in reporting suggest this is an underestimate.<sup>14</sup> Using a broader definition that includes cases with unknown, other, or missing specimen sources, the prevalence of gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum during that period could possibly be higher.<sup>3</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Untreated gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum can result in severe and lasting conditions, including corneal scarring, ocular perforation, and blindness.<sup>7</sup> There are no contemporary estimates of blindness related to gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum in the United States.

Comments also supported risk-based prophylaxis as an alternative strategy for prevention. However, there are no tools for assessing the risk of infection in newborns and no studies examining the use of risk-based vs universal prophylaxis. The USPSTF revised the recommendation to clarify this point. In addition, a number of comments promoted the use of iodine solutions (povidone-iodine) as an alternative to erythromycin ophthalmic ointment. The evidence review found limited studies on the use of iodine solutions and notes that they are not approved for use in the United States as ocular prophylaxis for gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum.

Bacterial vaginosis occurs when there is a shift in this flora to include a greater proportion of mixed anaerobic bacteria, such as the <em>Gardnerella</em>, <em>Prevotella</em>, and <em>Atopobium</em> species.<sup>12,13</sup> Most often, bacterial vaginosis is asymptomatic. When symptoms occur, they include off-white, thin, homogenous discharge, a vaginal &ldquo;fishy&rdquo; odor, or both.</p>\r\n<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>\r\n<p>Persons who are not at increased risk for preterm delivery include pregnant persons with no history of previous preterm delivery or other risk factors for preterm delivery. While multiple factors increase risk for preterm delivery, one of the strongest risk factors is prior preterm delivery.</p>\r\n<p>See the Potential Preventable Burden section for additional information on risk factors for preterm delivery.</p>\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>Screening tests for bacterial vaginosis are performed on vaginal secretions obtained during a pelvic examination in a primary care setting. Available screening tests include nucleic acid assays, sialidase assays, and clinical assessment (ie, using the Amsel criteria of pH, vaginal discharge, clue cells, and &ldquo;whiff test&rdquo;).</p>\r\n<h3>Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>Oral metronidazole and oral clindamycin, as well as vaginal metronidazole gel or clindamycin cream, are the usual treatments for symptomatic bacterial vaginosis. The optimal treatment regimen for pregnant persons with bacterial vaginosis is unclear.</p>\r\n<h3>Additional Tools and Resources</h3>\r\n<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website provides current treatment recommendations.<sup>14</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>\r\n<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>\r\n<p>Bacterial vaginosis occurs in as many as 29% of women in the US<sup>15</sup> and in 5.8% to 19.3% of pregnant women, depending on the specific population being studied.<sup>1,16</sup> Reported factors that increase the likelihood of a diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis include African American race, poverty, smoking, increased body mass index, vaginal douching, low educational attainment, and certain sexual behaviors, including a high number of partners, lack of condom or contraceptive use, vaginal sex, sex with a female partner, and concurrent sexually transmitted infections.<sup>6,15,17,18</sup></p>\r\n<p>Causes of preterm delivery are likely multifactorial, and numerous risk factors are associated with an increased risk for preterm birth.<sup>6</sup> History of a prior preterm delivery is associated with a 2.5-fold higher odds for preterm delivery in subsequent pregnancies.<sup>19</sup> While bacterial vaginosis during pregnancy is associated with a 2-fold higher odds for preterm delivery,<sup>2</sup> it is not clear that bacterial vaginosis is a cause of preterm delivery. Other additional risk factors for preterm delivery include, but are not limited to, cervical insufficiency, multifetal gestation, young or advanced maternal age, low maternal body mass index (&lt;20, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared), genitourinary infections, HIV infection, and other maternal medical conditions.<sup>6,20-23</sup> The association of these additional risk factors with preterm delivery is small to moderate, and factors can act in isolation or in combination. Preterm birth rates also vary by race/ethnicity in the US; recent data report preterm birth rates of 8.6% among Asian women, 11.8% among Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander women, 9.7% among Hispanic women, 11.5% among American Indian/Alaska Native women, 14.1% among black women, and 9.1% among white women.<sup>7</sup> Among women with a prior preterm delivery, the rate of recurrent preterm delivery in African American women is 4 times higher than the rate of recurrent preterm delivery in white women.<sup>20</sup> Even when these risk factors are present, it is unclear whether screening and treating asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis in pregnant persons at increased risk for preterm delivery prevents preterm delivery.</p>\r\n<p>African American race is both associated with bacterial vaginosis and strongly associated with preterm delivery. Other factors associated with both bacterial vaginosis and preterm delivery include young age, nulliparity, current tobacco use, low educational attainment, lower income, and concurrent sexually transmitted infections.</p>\r\n<p>Five studies provided evidence on the benefit of treatment of bacterial vaginosis in women with a previous preterm delivery for reducing the incidence of preterm delivery. Four of these studies evaluated the treatment of bacterial vaginosis with oral metronidazole6 and reported the incidence of preterm delivery at less than 37 weeks. Three of these studies reported statistically significant absolute reductions in preterm delivery after treatment (ranging from 18% to 29% absolute reductions in risk), and 1 study reported no significant difference. Limitations of the evidence, including imprecision, the fact that some of the results were from subgroup analyses, and the inconsistency of results, prevented a definitive conclusion about the benefit.<sup>6</sup> Two studies (1 evaluating oral metronidazole and the other evaluating vaginal clindamycin) presented results for preterm delivery at less than 34 weeks, and the results were mixed.<sup>6</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Potential Harms</h4>\r\n<p>The harms of screening for bacterial vaginosis in pregnant persons and treatment with antibiotics generally involve adverse effects such as gastrointestinal upset and vaginal candidiasis.<sup>6</sup> Four observational studies and 2 large meta-analyses of observational studies on the use of metronidazole during pregnancy for any reason (not limited to bacterial vaginosis) reported no increase in congenital malformations or incident cancer in children exposed in utero.<sup>24-29</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Current Practice</h4>\r\n<p>No data are available on how frequently pregnant persons at increased risk for preterm delivery are screened for bacterial vaginosis during pregnancy, but screening in asymptomatic pregnant persons is not recommended by any large US professional organization. Clinicians routinely test and treat pregnant persons for symptomatic bacterial vaginosis.</p><h2>Other Related USPSTF Recommendations</h2><p>The USPSTF has also issued recommendations on screening for numerous conditions in pregnant persons, including asymptomatic bacteriuria,<sup>30</sup> syphilis,<sup>31</sup> hepatitis B,<sup>32</sup> and HIV.<sup>33</sup></p><h2>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h2><p>The USPSTF last issued a recommendation on this topic in 2008. Although newer evidence was reviewed, the recommendations have essentially remained the same. The language used to describe a pregnant person&rsquo;s risk for preterm delivery has been updated to be more consistent with other current USPSTF recommendations.</p>","other":"<h2>Supporting Evidence</h2><h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n<p>To update its 2008 recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a systematic review<sup>6,34</sup> to evaluate the accuracy of screening and the benefits and harms of screening for and treatment of bacterial vaginosis in asymptomatic pregnant persons.</p>\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed evidence from 25 cross-sectional studies that reported on test accuracy of the BD Affirm VPIII test (Becton, Dickinson), BD Max system, OSOM BVBLUE test (Sekisui Diagnostics), and the Amsel clinical criteria to diagnose bacterial vaginosis.<sup>6,34</sup> The vast majority of studies were conducted in nonpregnant and symptomatic women; only 2 studies were conducted exclusively in asymptomatic pregnant women, and 2 additional studies were conducted in symptomatic pregnant women. None of the available evidence indicated that accuracy would differ between pregnant and nonpregnant populations. Studies were conducted in a variety of settings, including academic, hospital-based outpatient, or community obstetrics-gynecology clinics; sexually transmitted infection and family planning clinics; local health department clinics; and longitudinal cohorts; most (13 studies) were conducted in the US.</p>\r\n<p>Pooled sensitivity and specificity of the BD Affirm VPIII test was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.80-0.92) and 0.81 (95% CI, 0.73-0.88), respectively (5 studies; n = 2936).<sup>6</sup> Only 1 study (n = 1338) reported accuracy of the BD Max system; sensitivity was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.91-0.94) and specificity was 0.92 (95% CI, 0.90-0.94).<sup>6</sup> Three studies reported accuracy of the OSOM BVBLUE test (n = 864); sensitivity ranged from 0.61 to 0.92, and specificity ranged from 0.86 to 0.99.<sup>6,34</sup> Fifteen studies (n = 7171) reported on accuracy of complete Amsel criteria (having at least 3 of the following 4 criteria to detect bacterial vaginosis: vaginal pH &gt;4.5, presence of clue cells, thin homogeneous discharge, and a positive whiff test result [an amine, &ldquo;fishy&rdquo; odor when potassium hydroxide is added to vaginal discharge]). Pooled sensitivity and specificity from 14 of those studies were 0.76 (95% CI, 0.63-0.85) and 0.95 (95% CI, 0.89-0.98), respectively.<sup>6,34</sup>Five studies (n = 2674) reported on the accuracy of using modified Amsel criteria (having at least 2 of the following 3 criteria to detect bacterial vaginosis: presence of clue cells, thin homogeneous discharge, and a positive whiff test result). Pooled sensitivity from 4 studies was 0.67 (95% CI, 0.54-0.78) and specificity was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.93-0.98).<sup>6,34</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>No studies were identified that directly evaluated the benefit of screening for bacterial vaginosis in asymptomatic pregnant persons on reducing preterm delivery and related morbidity and mortality.<sup>6,34</sup></p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed evidence from 13 randomized clinical trials that reported on the effect of treatment of asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis in pregnant women on preterm delivery and related morbidity.<sup>6</sup> Most studies enrolled pregnant women in their second trimester of pregnancy. Ten trials targeted a general obstetric population and enrolled participants without regard to risk for preterm delivery.<sup>6,34-44</sup> Zero percent to 10.9% of participants in these trials had a history of prior preterm delivery, and 2 of these trials reported results by subgroup of participants who had a history of prior preterm delivery. Three additional trials specifically targeted pregnant women who had a history of prior preterm delivery.<sup>6,34,45-47</sup> Of the 7 trials that reported information on race/ethnicity of participants, the percentage of participants who were nonwhite ranged from 2% to 85%. Four trials were conducted in the US; the others were conducted in Europe and Australia. Interventions evaluated included oral metronidazole (3 trials), oral metronidazole plus erythromycin (1 trial), oral clindamycin (2 trials), and intravaginal clindamycin (7 trials).</p>\r\n<p>Findings from trials targeting a general obstetric population were largely consistent in reporting no benefit across a variety of preterm delivery outcomes. No statistically significant reduction was found in all-cause preterm delivery prior to 37 weeks (pooled relative risk [RR], 1.02 [95% CI, 0.86-1.20%]; 6 studies; n = 6307), spontaneous preterm delivery prior to 37 weeks (pooled RR, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.56-1.07]; 8 studies; n = 7571), preterm delivery prior to 32 weeks (pooled RR, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.54-1.42]; 3 studies; n = 5564), birth weight less than 2500 g (pooled RR, 1.03 [95% CI, 0.83-1.29]; 5 studies; n = 5377), birth weight less than 1500 g (pooled RR, 1.05 [95% CI, 0.50-2.18]; 3 studies; n = 5149), or premature rupture of membranes (PROM) or preterm PROM (pooled RR, 1.11 [95% CI, 0.72-1.72]; 4 studies; n = 3568).<sup>6,34</sup></p>\r\n<p>Findings from the 5 trials reporting outcomes for women with a history of prior preterm delivery were inconsistent. Four trials (n = 451) reported on preterm delivery prior to 37 weeks in women with a history of prior preterm delivery.<sup>6</sup> RRs ranged from 0.17 to 1.33; 3 of the studies had statistically significant findings favoring treatment, while 1 did not.<sup>6,34</sup> Two trials (n = 102) reported on preterm delivery prior to 34 weeks in women with a history of prior preterm delivery. RRs were 1.00 (95% CI, 0.07-14.05) in 1 study and 0.41 (95% CI, 0.08-2.11) in the other study.<sup>6</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Screening and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>No studies that directly evaluated the harms of screening for bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy were identified.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed evidence on harms of treatment of bacterial vaginosis during pregnancy from 8 randomized clinical trials that reported on maternal harms and from 4 observational studies and 2 meta-analyses of observational studies that reported on harms to children from in utero exposure.</p>\r\n<p>The 8 trials that reported on maternal harms of treatment of bacterial vaginosis during pregnancy also reported on benefits of treatment, so study characteristics are described above. Four trials<sup>35,36,42,47</sup> (n = 1718) reported on adverse events from intravaginal clindamycin. No serious adverse events were reported. Minor adverse effects such as vaginal candidiasis, troublesome discharge, and study withdrawal because of itching were reported infrequently and at similar rates between intervention and control groups. Maternal harms of oral clindamycin were reported in 2 trials<sup>38,41</sup> (n = 3345). Only 1 trial reported on serious adverse events and did not observe any in either treatment group. Both studies reported a higher incidence of stopping medication in the oral clindamycin group, although findings were statistically significant in only 1 study. Maternal harms of oral metronidazole were reported in 2 trials<sup>39,40</sup> (n = 2776). A higher incidence of adverse events was reported with oral metronidazole in both studies, although the finding was only statistically significant in 1 study.</p>\r\n<p>Three observational studies<sup>27,28</sup> (n = 62,271) and 2 meta-analyses<sup>24,25</sup> (n &gt;199,541) reported on congenital malformations among children exposed to metronidazole in utero for any clinical indication (not just bacterial vaginosis). The studies included in this body of evidence dated back to the 1960s to 1990s; the 3 observational studies were based on registry data from Denmark, Hungary, and Israel. None reported any significant increase in congenital malformations. A single observational study (n = 328,846) of the Tennessee Medicaid program reported on cancer incidence before age 5 years among children exposed to metronidazole in utero, and no significant increase with exposure was observed.<sup>29</sup></p>\r\n<p>Overall, the USPSTF found few reported maternal harms and no reported fetal harms in the literature. In addition, use of metronidazole and clindamycin to treat bacterial vaginosis during pregnancy has become the standard of care, with no signal of significant maternal or fetal adverse effects to date.</p>\r\n<h3>Is the Evidence Consistent With Biological Understanding?</h3>\r\n<p>Causes of preterm delivery are likely multifactorial, and the exact mechanism of how some risk factors may lead to preterm delivery is poorly understood. Epidemiologic data suggest that risk for preterm delivery may be higher when asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis is present (pooled odds ratio, 2.16 [95% CI, 1.56-3.00]; 32 studies; 30,518 participants).<sup>2</sup> However, the causal pathway of how bacterial vaginosis may lead to preterm delivery is unclear. Earlier theories postulated that bacterial vaginosis may lead to upper genital tract infections, which may in turn contribute to&nbsp; preterm PROM or preterm labor. More recently, it has been suggested that maternal vaginal mucosal immune response may play a role in preterm labor or preterm PROM, as well as acquisition of bacterial vaginosis. Although the evidence is clear that treating asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis in pregnant persons not at increased risk for preterm delivery does not prevent preterm delivery, it is still unclear whether treating asymptomatic pregnant persons at increased risk for preterm delivery may help prevent preterm delivery.</p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from October 8 to November 4, 2019. In response to public comments, language has been added clarifying that the current recommendation statement applies to screening for asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis. The current recommendation does not address treatment of symptomatic bacterial vaginosis, which is addressed by other treatment guidelines. Additionally, the need for studies that evaluate screening test accuracy in pregnant persons has been added to the Research Needs and Gaps section. Some comments requested additional information on subgroups and additional screening tests. Although this information was sought in the systematic evidence review that informed the recommendation, no additional evidence was identified.</p><h2>Research Needs and Gaps</h2><p>More studies are needed to evaluate screening for and treatment of asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis in pregnant persons at increased risk for preterm delivery. These studies should</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Include pregnant persons with a history of prior preterm delivery, as well as other risk factors for preterm delivery, such as cervical insufficiency, multifetal gestation, young or advanced maternal age, low maternal body mass index (&lt;20), and African American, Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander, or American Indian/Alaska Native race/ethnicity.</li>\r\n<li>Be adequately powered to detect a reduction of all-cause preterm delivery prior to 37 weeks&rsquo; gestation.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>If a reduction in preterm delivery is found with treatment of asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis in pregnant persons at increased risk for preterm delivery, then additional research is needed on ways to better identify persons at increased risk for preterm delivery. Additionally, given the biochemical and hormonal changes that occur during pregnancy, further studies of bacterial vaginosis screening tests in pregnant persons are needed to confirm test accuracy in this population.</p><h2>Recommendations of Others</h2><p>Most organizations in the US do not recommend screening for bacterial vaginosis in asymptomatic pregnant women. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists states that several specific screening tests, including testing for bacterial vaginosis, have been proposed to assess a woman&rsquo;s risk of preterm delivery; however, intervention studies based on these screening tests in asymptomatic women (for preterm delivery) have not demonstrated improved perinatal outcomes, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists does not recommend the use of these tests as a screening strategy.<sup>48</sup> The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states that &ldquo;Evidence does not support routine screening for bacterial vaginosis in asymptomatic pregnant women at high risk for preterm delivery. Symptomatic women should be evaluated and treated.&rdquo;<sup>49</sup> The American Academy of Family Physicians endorses the 2008 USPSTF recommendation on screening for bacterial vaginosis.<sup>50</sup></p>","topic":"Bacterial Vaginosis in Pregnant Persons to Prevent Preterm Delivery: Screening","keywords":"Bacterial Vaginosis|Pregnancy|BV|vaginitis","pubDate":"2020-04-07","categories":["11","2"],"tool":["253","255","254"]},"429":{"topicType":"Preventive medication and Counseling","topicYear":2021,"uspstfAlias":"tobacco-use-in-adults-and-pregnant-women-counseling-and-interventions","specific":[1905,1906,1908,1907],"title":"Tobacco Smoking Cessation in Adults, Including Pregnant Persons: Interventions","rationale":"<h2>Importance</h2><p>Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of disease, disability, and death in the US. In 2014, it was estimated that 480,000 deaths annually are attributed to cigarette smoking, including second hand smoke.<sup>1</sup> Smoking during pregnancy can increase the risk for miscarriage, congenital anomalies, stillbirth, fetal growth restriction, preterm birth, placental abruption, and complications in the offspring, including sudden infant death syndrome and impaired lung function in childhood.<sup>1-4</sup> In 2019 (the most recent data currently available), an estimated 50.6 million US adults (20.8% of the adult population) used tobacco; 14.0% of the US adult population currently smoked cigarettes; and 4.5% of the US adult population used electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes).<sup>5</sup> According to data from the National Vital Statistics System, in 2016, 7.2% of women who gave birth smoked cigarettes during pregnancy.<sup>6</sup> There are disparities in smoking behaviors associated with certain sociodemographic factors: smoking rates are particularly high in non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native persons; lesbian, gay, or bisexual adults; adults whose highest level of educational attainment is a General Educational Development certificate; persons who are uninsured and those with Medicaid; adults with a disability; and persons with mild, moderate, or severe generalized anxiety symptoms.<sup>5</sup> According to the 2015 National Health Interview Survey, which reported responses from 33,672 adults, 68% of adults who smoked reported that they wanted to stop smoking and 55% attempted quitting in the past year;<sup>7</sup> only 7% reported having recently quit smoking and 31% reported having used cessation counseling, medication, or both when trying to quit.<sup>7</sup></p><h2>USPSTF Assessment of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h2><p>The USPSTF concludes with high certainty that the net benefit of behavioral interventions and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)&ndash;approved pharmacotherapy for tobacco smoking cessation, alone or combined, in nonpregnant adults who smoke is <strong>substantial</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes with high certainty that the net benefit of behavioral interventions for tobacco smoking cessation on perinatal outcomes and smoking cessation in pregnant persons is <strong>substantial</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes that the evidence on pharmacotherapy interventions for tobacco smoking cessation in pregnant persons is <strong>insufficient</strong> because few studies are available, and the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes that the evidence on the use of e-cigarettes for tobacco smoking cessation in adults, including pregnant persons, is <strong>insufficient</strong>, and the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined.

The USPSTF has issued a separate recommendation statement on primary care interventions for the prevention and cessation of tobacco use in children and adolescents.<sup>9</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Definitions</h3>\r\n<p>Key definitions related to tobacco use are reported in the <a href=\"#box\">Box</a>. Although tobacco use refers broadly to the use of any tobacco product, cigarette smoking has historically been the most prevalent form of tobacco use in the US, and most of the evidence surrounding cessation of tobacco products relates to quitting combustible cigarette smoking. Thus, the current USPSTF recommendations focus on interventions for tobacco smoking cessation. Additionally, although e-cigarettes are considered a tobacco product that should also be the focus of tobacco prevention and cessation efforts, for this recommendation statement, the evidence on e-cigarettes as a potential cessation aid for cigarette smoking was also evaluated.</p>\r\n<h3>Assessment of Tobacco Use</h3>\r\n<p>All patients should be asked about their tobacco use, whether or not risk factors for use are present, and encouraged to stop using tobacco. When smoking is identified, all patients should be provided interventions to quit smoking. Higher smoking prevalence has been observed in men; persons younger than 65 years; non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native persons; persons who are lesbian, gay, or bisexual; persons whose highest level of educational attainment is a General Educational Development certificate; persons with an annual household income less than $35,000; persons with a disability; and persons with mild, moderate, or severe anxiety symptoms.<sup>5</sup></p>\r\n<p>Common approaches for clinicians to assess patients&rsquo; tobacco use include the following.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The 5 As: (1) Ask about tobacco use; (2) Advise to quit through clear, personalized messages; (3) Assess willingness to quit; (4) Assist in quitting; and (5) Arrange follow-up and support.<sup>12</sup></li>\r\n<li>&ldquo;Ask, Advise, Refer,&rdquo; which encourages clinicians to ask patients about tobacco use, advise them to quit, and refer them to telephone quit lines, other evidence-based cessation interventions, or both.<sup>12</sup></li>\r\n<li>Vital Sign: Treating smoking status as a vital sign and recording smoking status at every health visit are also frequently used to assess smoking status.<sup>12</sup></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Because many pregnant women who smoke do not report it, using multiple choice questions to assess smoking status in this group may improve disclosure.<sup>12</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Interventions for Tobacco Cessation and Implementation Considerations</h3>\r\n<h4>Nonpregnant Adults</h4>\r\n<p>Effective tobacco smoking cessation interventions for nonpregnant adults include behavioral counseling and pharmacotherapy, either individually or in combination.<sup>13,14</sup></p>\r\n<p><strong>Combined behavioral counseling interventions and pharmacotherapy.</strong> Combining behavioral and pharmacotherapy interventions has been shown to increase tobacco smoking cessation rates compared with either usual care/brief cessation interventions alone or pharmacotherapy alone.<sup>13</sup> Most combination interventions include behavioral counseling involving several sessions (&ge;4), with planned total contact time usually ranging from 90 to 300 minutes.<sup>13</sup> The largest effect was found in interventions that provided 8 or more sessions, although the difference in effect among the number of sessions was not significant.<sup>13</sup></p>\r\n<p><strong>Behavioral counseling interventions.<em> </em></strong>Many behavioral counseling interventions are available to increase tobacco smoking cessation in adults. These interventions can be delivered in the primary care setting or can be referred to community settings with feedback to the primary care clinician. Effective behavioral interventions include physician advice, nurse advice, individual counseling with a cessation specialist, group behavioral interventions, telephone counseling, and mobile phone&ndash;based interventions.<sup>13</sup> Behavioral counseling interventions used in studies typically targeted individuals who were motivated to quit tobacco smoking.<sup>13</sup> For additional information about behavioral counseling interventions in nonpregnant adults, see <a href=\"#tab2\">Table 2</a>.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Pharmacotherapy.<em> </em></strong>The current pharmacotherapy interventions approved by the FDA for the treatment of tobacco smoking dependence in adults are nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) (including nicotine transdermal patches, lozenges, gum, inhalers, or nasal spray), bupropion hydrochloride sustained-release (SR), and varenicline.<sup>46</sup> All 3 types of pharmacotherapy increase tobacco smoking cessation rates. Using a combination of NRT products (in particular, combining short-acting plus long-acting forms of NRT) has been found to be more effective than using a single form of NRT.<sup>13</sup> Based on a smaller number of studies, varenicline appears to be more effective than NRT or bupropion SR.<sup>13</sup> Information on dosing regimens is available in the package inserts of individual medications or in the 2020 Surgeon General Report on Smoking Cessation.<sup>47</sup><em>&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n<h4>Pregnant Persons</h4>\r\n<p><strong>Behavioral counseling interventions.</strong> Providing any psychosocial intervention to pregnant persons who smoke tobacco can increase smoking cessation. The behavioral counseling intervention type most often studied in pregnant persons who smoke was counseling. Behavioral interventions were more effective when they provided more intensive counseling, were augmented with messages and self-help materials tailored for pregnant persons, and included messages about the effects of smoking on both maternal and fetal health and strong advice to quit as soon as possible.<sup>12,13</sup> Although smoking cessation at any point during pregnancy yields substantial health benefits for the expectant mother and infant, quitting early in pregnancy provides the greatest benefit to the fetus.<sup>12,13</sup> Other interventions included feedback, incentives, health education, and social support, although provision of health education alone, without counseling, was not found to be effective.

The Surgeon General&rsquo;s report issued some additional findings regarding internet-based interventions for cessation and describes some suggestive but not sufficient evidence about specific e-cigarette use behaviors and increased cessation. Overall, the Surgeon General&rsquo;s report found that there is inadequate evidence to conclude that e-cigarettes increase smoking cessation. More information on the Surgeon General&rsquo;s Report on Smoking Cessation is available at <a href=\"https://https:/www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/sgr/2020-smoking-cessation/%23fact-sheets\">https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/sgr/2020-smoking-cessation/#fact-sheets</a>.</p>\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statements</h3>\r\n<h4>Pharmacotherapy for Pregnant Persons</h4>\r\n<p>According to data from the National Vital Statistics System, in 2016, 7.2% of women who gave birth smoked cigarettes during pregnancy,<sup>6</sup> and among 1071 pregnant women aged 18 to 44 years, 3.6% reported using e-cigarettes.<sup>48</sup> Smoking during pregnancy reduces fetal growth, increases the risk of preterm birth, and doubles the risk for delivering an infant with low birth weight. It also increases the relative risk for stillbirth death by 25% to 50%.<sup>1,2</sup> Quitting smoking early in pregnancy can reduce or eliminate the adverse effects of smoking on fetal growth.<sup>47</sup> For pregnant persons for whom behavioral counseling alone does not work, evidence to support other options to increase smoking cessation during pregnancy are limited. Few clinical trials have evaluated the effectiveness of NRT for smoking cessation in pregnant women. Although most studies were in the direction of benefit, no statistically significant increase in cessation was seen.<sup>13</sup> There is limited evidence on harms of NRT from trials in pregnant persons. Potential adverse maternal events reported in studies of NRT include slightly increased diastolic blood pressure and skin reactions to the patch.<sup>13</sup> Potential adverse events reported in nonpregnant adults include higher rates of low-risk cardiovascular events, such as tachycardia.<sup>13</sup> It has been suggested that NRT may be safer than smoking during pregnancy given that cigarette smoke contains harmful substances in addition to nicotine. The USPSTF identified no studies on bupropion SR or varenicline pharmacotherapy for tobacco smoking cessation during pregnancy.</p>\r\n<p>In the absence of clear evidence on the balance of benefits and harms of pharmacotherapy in pregnant women, clinicians are encouraged to consider the severity of tobacco dependence in each patient and engage in shared decision-making to determine the best individual treatment course.</p>\r\n<h4>e-Cigarettes in Nonpregnant Adults and Pregnant Persons</h4>\r\n<p>No tobacco product use is risk-free, including the use of e-cigarettes. Tobacco smoking cessation can be difficult for many individuals; thus, having a variety of tools available to help persons quit smoking would potentially be helpful. Findings from small surveys and qualitative data report mixed findings on whether physicians are recommending e-cigarettes to patients to help them quit smoking.<sup>13,49-51</sup> Few randomized trials have evaluated the effectiveness of e-cigarettes to increase tobacco smoking cessation in nonpregnant adults, and no trials have evaluated e-cigarettes for tobacco smoking cessation in pregnant persons.<sup>13</sup> Overall, results were mixed on whether smoking cessation increased with e-cigarettes; however, continued e-cigarette use after the intervention phase of trials remained high, indicating continued nicotine dependence. Trial evidence on harms of e-cigarettes used for smoking cessation is also limited. The most commonly reported adverse effects from e-cigarette use reported in trials included coughing, nausea, throat irritation, and sleep disruption.<sup>13</sup> Generally, no significant difference in short-term serious adverse events associated with e-cigarette use was reported.<sup>13</sup> Evidence on potential harms of e-cigarette use in general (whether for tobacco smoking cessation or not) has been reviewed in the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine report Public Health Consequences of E-Cigarettes.<sup>52</sup> For example, the report found conclusive evidence that in addition to nicotine, most e-cigarette products contain and emit numerous potentially toxic substances. Additionally, an outbreak of e-cigarette, or vaping product, use&ndash;associated lung injury (EVALI) that occurred in the US in late 2019 also suggests potential harms of e-cigarette use. The vast majority of cases have been associated with tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)&ndash;containing e-cigarettes.<sup>53</sup></p>\r\n<p>Given the high rates of e-cigarette use in children and adolescents currently in the US,<sup>54</sup> the USPSTF recognizes that an overall public health question remains on whether the potential use of e-cigarettes as a tobacco smoking cessation aid (if ever proven effective) could be balanced with the high rates of e-cigarette use in youth as a driver for increasing overall tobacco use. The USPSTF has issued a separate recommendation statement on the prevention of tobacco use, including e-cigarettes, in children and adolescents.<sup>9</sup> The current USPSTF recommendation statement for adults evaluated the evidence on the benefits and harms of e-cigarettes to increase tobacco cessation; the USPSTF found this evidence to be insufficient. Given the proven effectiveness of behavioral counseling interventions in both nonpregnant and pregnant adults, and of pharmacotherapy in nonpregnant adults, the USPSTF recommends that clinicians focus on offering behavioral counseling and pharmacotherapy to increase smoking cessation in nonpregnant adults, and behavioral counseling to increase smoking cessation in pregnant persons.</p>\r\n<h3>Other Related USPSTF Recommendations</h3>\r\n<p>In 2020, the USPSTF recommended that primary care clinicians provide interventions, including education or brief counseling, to prevent the initiation of tobacco use (including e-cigarettes) in school-aged children and adolescents.<sup>9</sup> The USPSTF found the evidence on primary care interventions for the cessation of tobacco use in youth to be insufficient.</p><h2>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h2><p>This recommendation statement replaces the 2015 USPSTF recommendation statement on behavioral and pharmacotherapy interventions for tobacco smoking cessation in adults, including pregnant women.<sup>55</sup> The current recommendation statement has been updated to reflect newer evidence and language in the field of tobacco cessation and includes a description of the 2019 EVALI outbreak in the US. However, the recommendations on the services primary care clinicians should provide for tobacco cessation are the same as in 2015.</p><h2>Table 2.

The vast majority of evidence identified focused on cigarette smoking cessation.</p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Tobacco Cessation Interventions</h3>\r\n<h4>Nonpregnant Adults</h4>\r\n<p><strong>Behavioral counseling interventions.</strong> The USPSTF reviewed evidence on the benefits of behavioral counseling interventions on tobacco use cessation in general adults primarily from 20 systematic reviews that covered approximately 830 RCTs and more than 500,000 participants.<sup>13</sup> The evidence almost exclusively evaluated interventions for cessation of cigarette smoking. Physician advice, nurse advice, individual counseling with a cessation specialist, group behavioral interventions, telephone counseling, and mobile phone&ndash;based interventions have all been found to be effective to increase cessation of cigarette smoking.<sup>13</sup></p>\r\n<p>Based on a 2013 systematic review that pooled 26 trials (n = 22,239), rates of smoking cessation at 6 months or more were an average of 8.0% in groups that received physician advice compared with 4.8% in groups that received no advice or usual care (risk ratio [RR], 1.76 [95% CI, 1.58-1.96]).<sup>13,56</sup> When stratified by intensity level, both minimal advice (defined as a single session lasting &lt;20 minutes with &le;1 follow-up sessions) and intensive advice (defined as a single session lasting &ge;20 minutes or &gt;1 follow-up session) from a physician was associated with significantly increased cessation rates compared with no advice. Although not definitive, some subgroup analyses suggest that more intensive physician counseling (&gt;20 minutes for initial consult, use of additional materials, or &gt;1 follow-up visit) may be associated with an increase in cessation rates, particularly in patients who have smoking-related disease.<sup>13,56</sup></p>\r\n<p>Based on a 2017 systematic review that pooled 44 trials evaluating nurse advice, 14.2% of participants who received interventions from nurses achieved smoking cessation at 6 months or more compared with 12.2% of those who received usual care or minimal intervention (RR, 1.29 [95% CI, 1.21-1.38]).<sup>13,57</sup> No evidence of effect modification was found when comparing higher- or lower-intensity counseling provided by nurses.</p>\r\n<p>A systematic review from 2017 that pooled 33 trials (n = 13,762) found that an average of 11.4% of participants who received individual counseling with a cessation specialist achieved smoking cessation, compared with 7.7% of those who received minimal contact of less than 15 minutes of advice (RR, 1.48 [95% CI, 1.34-1.64]).<sup>13,58</sup> The review found some evidence suggesting that more intensive counseling was associated with higher cessation rates. Another systematic review published in 2017 that pooled 13 trials (n = 4395) also found that participants receiving group behavioral interventions had higher cessation rates compared with those who received a self-help program (10.4% cessation rate in intervention group vs 5.8% cessation rate in control group; RR, 1.88 [95% CI, 1.52-2.33]).<sup>13,59</sup></p>\r\n<p>A 2019 review on telephone counseling interventions found that proactive telephone counseling (where telephone counselors called participants directly either to initiate counseling or in response to a participant calling a quitline) was associated with increased cessation rates.<sup>13,60</sup> If the telephone counseling was a &ldquo;cold call&rdquo; from telephone counselors to initiate counseling, smoking cessation rates were 11.0% in control participants and 13.9% in telephone counseling recipients (RR, 1.25 [95% CI, 1.15-1.35]; 65 trials; n = 41,233).<sup>13,60</sup> If telephone counseling occurred in response to a participant contacting a quitline, cessation rates were 7.8% in control participants and 10.8% in intervention recipients (RR, 1.38 [95% CI, 1.19-1.61]; 14 trials; n = 32,484).<sup>13,60</sup></p>\r\n<p>A 2019 review that pooled 13 trials (n = 14,133) found higher cessation rates associated with mobile phone&ndash;based interventions.<sup>13,61</sup> All studies primarily used text messaging as the main intervention component, although a limited number of studies looked at individual mobile phone applications. Smoking cessation rates were an average of 5.6% in participants receiving usual or minimal care and 9.5% in those receiving mobile phone&ndash;based interventions (RR, 1.54 [95% CI, 1.19-2.00]).</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF considered evidence on other behavioral counseling interventions such as print-based, nontailored self-help materials, internet-based interventions, motivational interviewing, biofeedback, exercise, acupuncture, and hypnotherapy;<sup>13</sup> however, limited evidence was available on these interventions.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Pharmacotherapy.</strong> The USPSTF reviewed evidence from 4 systematic reviews on pharmacotherapy that reported smoking cessation at 6 months or more.<sup>13</sup></p>\r\n<p>A 2018 review on NRT (133 studies; n = 64,640)<sup>62</sup> found that 16.9% of participants taking any form of NRT achieved smoking abstinence at 6 months or more compared with 10.5% of participants receiving placebo or taking no NRT (RR, 1.55 [95% CI, 1.49-1.61]). All forms of NRT (patch, gum, inhaler, intranasal, and tablets) were found to be effective. Another review found that using combination NRT (patch plus a fast-acting form) was associated with higher smoking cessation rates than using a single form of NRT (16.9% vs 13.9%; RR, 1.25 [95% CI, 1.15-1.36]).<sup>63</sup></p>\r\n<p>A 2020 systematic review on the use of antidepressants for smoking cessation (46 studies; n = 17,866) found that bupropion SR was associated with a significantly higher rate of smoking abstinence at 6 months or more than placebo or no bupropion SR (19.0% vs 11.0%; RR, 1.64 [95% CI, 1.52-1.77]).<sup>64</sup></p>\r\n<p>Based on pooled analyses of 27 studies (n = 12,625), a 2016 systematic review found that varenicline was associated with higher rates of smoking cessation over placebo (25.6% vs 11.1%; RR, 2.24 [95% CI, 2.06-2.43]).<sup>65</sup></p>\r\n<p>Smaller subsets of studies from these reviews directly compared types of pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation. Eight studies (n = 6264) compared varenicline and NRT and found that varenicline was associated with a greater smoking cessation rate over any form of NRT.65 Six studies (n = 6286) evaluated varenicline vs bupropion SR and found that varenicline was associated with a higher cessation rate.<sup>64,65</sup> Smoking cessation rates among participants using NRT vs bupropion SR at 6 months or more did not significantly differ (10 studies; n = 9230).<sup>64</sup></p>\r\n<p><strong>Combined behavioral counseling interventions and pharmacotherapy.</strong> Combinations of behavioral counseling and pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation were also effective, and potentially more effective than behavioral counseling or pharmacotherapy alone.<sup>13</sup> A 2016 systematic review (52 studies; n = 19,488)<sup>66</sup> found that participants who received combination pharmacotherapy and intensive behavioral counseling had a higher abstinence rate at 6 months or more compared with control participants who received usual care, self-help materials, or brief advice on quitting (which was less intensive than the counseling or support given to the intervention groups) (15.2% vs 8.6%; RR, 1.83 [95% CI, 1.68-1.98]). These combination interventions often have behavioral components delivered by specialized smoking cessation counselors or trained staff; however, no difference in effectiveness was seen in studies in which a nonspecialist provided the counseling.<sup>13</sup> Most studies used NRT as the pharmacotherapy. The intensity and format of the behavioral counseling component of the intervention varied greatly, with the majority of studies offering at least 4 behavioral counseling sessions, with a total planned contact time generally ranging from 90 to 300 minutes. Most of the behavioral counseling was delivered by a specialized smoking cessation counselor or trained trial staff.</p>\r\n<p>Another systematic review,<sup>67</sup> which pooled analyses of 65 studies (n = 23,331), found that cessation rates at 6 months or more were modestly higher in participants who received behavioral support as an adjunct to pharmacotherapy than in those who received pharmacotherapy alone. Most studies offered NRT as the pharmacotherapy. Participants in the control group may have also received some counseling or support, but it was less intensive than in the intervention group. The addition of behavioral support to pharmacotherapy was associated with significantly higher cessation rates, approximately 17% in persons using pharmacotherapy alone vs 20% in those using a combination of pharmacotherapy and behavioral support (RR, 1.15 [95% CI, 1.08-1.22]).<sup>13</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Pregnant Persons</h4>\r\n<p>For benefits of tobacco use cessation interventions in pregnant persons, the USPSTF reviewed evidence from an existing systematic review on behavioral counseling interventions<sup>68</sup> and from primary studies of pharmacotherapy. As with the evidence base in nonpregnant adults, the available evidence primarily addressed smoking cessation.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Behavioral counseling interventions.</strong> Based on a systematic review from 2017,<sup>68</sup> the USPSTF found that behavioral counseling interventions in pregnant women were effective at improving rates of smoking cessation as well as some perinatal health outcomes. Pooled analyses from 97 studies (n = 26,637) found that use of any psychosocial intervention was associated with higher smoking cessation rates in late pregnancy relative to control groups (an average quit rate of 12.2% in control groups and 16.4% in intervention groups) (RR, 1.35 [95% CI, 1.23-1.48]). The majority of studies used counseling interventions, and analyses of only counseling interventions (51 studies; n = 18,276) found a significant increase in smoking cessation rates late in pregnancy, from 10.8% in control groups to 14.5% in intervention groups (RR, 1.31 [95% CI, 1.16-1.47]). Studies of other intervention types (health education, feedback, incentives, social support, and exercise) were much fewer, with fewer total participants. Findings of smoking cessation effectiveness by intervention type were all in the direction of benefit, although not all were statistically significant. No subgroup differences by intervention type were found. The same systematic review also assessed the association of behavioral counseling interventions with perinatal outcomes and found lower rates of low birth weight (RR, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.72-0.94]; 18 trials; n = 9402) and increased mean birth weight (mean difference, 55.6 g [95% CI, 29.82-81.38]; 26 trials; n = 11,338). No statistically significant difference in rates of preterm births or stillbirths was found.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Pharmacotherapy.</strong> The USPSTF identified 5 placebo-controlled trials on NRT during pregnancy.13 All 5 trials included behavioral counseling or support in addition to NRT. One trial used NRT gum as the intervention, one used an inhaler, while the other 3 trials used a NRT patch. Adherence to NRT in studies was low (&lt;10% in 1 study). Findings of the 5 trials were all generally in the direction of benefit with NRT; however, none of the studies, either individually or when pooled, found a statistically significant difference in smoking cessation (11.9% in NRT intervention groups vs 10.1% in control groups; RR, 1.11 [95% CI, 0.79-1.56]; 5 trials; n = 2033).<sup>13</sup> Seven trials (the 5 placebo-controlled trials previously mentioned plus 2 additional non&ndash;placebo-controlled trials) reported on perinatal and health outcomes with NRT during pregnancy;<sup>13</sup> findings were inconsistent and imprecise. No studies on bupropion SR or varenicline for smoking cessation during pregnancy were identified.</p>\r\n<h4>e-Cigarettes in Nonpregnant Adults and Pregnant Persons</h4>\r\n<p>The FDA classifies e-cigarettes as a tobacco product and to date, no e-cigarettes have been approved as a smoking cessation aid. Approximately 4.5% of adults<sup>5,69</sup> and 3.6% of pregnant women<sup>48</sup> report using e-cigarettes. Higher e-cigarette use is reported among young adults aged 18 to 24 years (7.6%)<sup>70</sup> and has been increasing in recent years.<sup>70</sup> In addition to young adults, e-cigarette use among adults is higher in men; non-Hispanic White adults and other non-Hispanic adults; lesbian, gay, or bisexual<sup>5</sup> persons; and persons with chronic illnesses (such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, and depression).<sup>13,71</sup> Most adult e-cigarette users report that quitting smoking and health improvement are major reasons why they started using e-cigarettes.<sup>72,73</sup> This is in contrast to youth, where it has been found that e-cigarette use increases risk of ever smoking cigarettes.<sup>52</sup> Nineteen percent of tobacco users use 2 or more tobacco products, the most common combination being cigarettes and e-cigarettes.<sup>74</sup></p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF identified 5 RCTs (n = 3117) on e-cigarettes for smoking cessation in nonpregnant adults<sup>13,75-80</sup> and no studies in pregnant persons.<sup>13</sup> All 5 studies were conducted outside of the US (2 in New Zealand, 1 in Italy, 1 in Korea, and 1 in the UK). Four of the studies included participants who either wanted to stop smoking or were attending a stop smoking service. The type of e-cigarette interventions (nicotine content, whether NRT was also given, nicotine cartridge vs e-liquid, and whether behavioral support was also provided) and control interventions (NRT vs nonnicotine e-cigarette) varied across studies, making comparisons difficult. Only 3 of the e-cigarettes used in the studies are currently available in the US. Study size ranged from 150 to 1124 participants.</p>\r\n<p>Reported trial findings were mixed. The 2 largest and most recent trials reported a statistically significant increase in smoking cessation at 6 months; 1 study reported smoking cessation rates of 4% in control groups vs 7%<sup>79</sup> in intervention groups; the second trial reported smoking cessation rates of 25% in control groups vs 35%<sup>78</sup> in intervention groups. The 3 remaining trials reported no statistically significant differences in smoking cessation rates. Three of the studies reported on continued e-cigarette use after achievement of smoking cessation in intervention groups at 6 months to 1 year, with continued e-cigarette use ranging from 38% to 80%. One study reported that 26.9% of all study participants were using e-cigarettes at 1 year.<sup>77</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Tobacco Cessation Interventions</h3>\r\n<h4>Nonpregnant Adults</h4>\r\n<p><strong>Behavioral counseling interventions.</strong> The USPSTF identified limited evidence on harms from behavioral counseling interventions for tobacco cessation. Three systematic reviews (1 on internet-based interventions, another on incentives, and 1 on hypnotherapy) did not find evidence of serious adverse events associated with interventions.<sup>13</sup></p>\r\n<p><strong>Pharmacotherapy.</strong> The USPSTF identified 4 systematic reviews on NRT that reported on harms<sup>13</sup>: 3 reviews compared harms of NRT vs placebo<sup>62,81,82</sup> and 1 compared harms from various types of NRT.<sup>63</sup> Twelve to 21 studies (n = 10,234 to 11,647) reported on cardiovascular harms. Statistically significantly more cardiovascular adverse events (in particular, heart palpitations and chest pain) were found for participants randomized to NRT vs placebo (RR, 1.81 [95% CI, 1.35-2.43]; 21 trials; n = 11,647).<sup>82</sup> However, when analyses focused on major cardiovascular adverse events (combined outcome of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke), findings were no longer statistically significant (RR, 1.38 [95% CI, 0.58-3.26]; 21 trials; n = 11,647).<sup>82</sup> Other reported harms associated with NRT included nausea, vomiting, gastrointestinal symptoms, and insomnia. Localized increased skin irritation at the NRT patch site has also been reported. No statistically significant increase in headaches, dizziness, anxiety, or depression were found. Cardiac adverse events and other serious adverse events did not differ by type of NRT.<sup>63</sup></p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF considered evidence on harms from bupropion SR for tobacco smoking cessation from 4 systematic reviews.13 No difference in serious adverse events (RR, 1.30 [95% CI, 1.00-1.69]; 33 trials; n = 9631),<sup>83</sup> cardiovascular adverse events (RR, 1.03 [95% CI, 0.71-1.50]; 27 trials; n = 10,402),<sup>82</sup> or major cardiovascular events (RR, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.31-1.04]; 27 trials; n = 10,402)<sup>82</sup> were found with bupropion SR (compared with placebo or no bupropion SR). No difference in moderate and severe neuropsychiatric events, including rates of suicidal behavior and ideation, were found with bupropion SR (compared with varenicline or NRT) in the recent Evaluating Adverse Events in a Global Smoking Cessation Study (EAGLES) trial.<sup>84,85</sup></p>\r\n<p>Evidence on harms of varenicline for tobacco cessation are available from 3 systematic reviews on varenicline in unselected smokers, 4 systematic reviews of varenicline among persons with severe mental illness, and 1 review on varenicline for cessation of smokeless tobacco.<sup>13</sup> Common adverse effects reported with varenicline include nausea, insomnia, abnormal dreams, headache, and fatigue.<sup>13</sup> One review found an increase in serious adverse events with varenicline in unselected smokers (RR, 1.25 [95% CI, 1.04-1.49]; 29 trials; n = 15,370); however, many of these events included comorbidities that were mostly considered by the study authors to be unrelated to the treatments.<sup>65</sup> Across 3 systematic reviews (encompassing 18 to 38 studies; n = 8587 to 12,706), no statistically significant difference in cardiovascular adverse events or cardiovascular severe adverse events was found.<sup>13</sup> Additionally, no statistically significant increase in neuropsychiatric adverse events (including depression, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempt) was found across several systematic reviews.<sup>13</sup></p>\r\n<p><strong>Combinations of behavioral counseling interventions and pharmacotherapy.</strong> The USPSTF did not identify any reports of adverse events related to combinations of behavioral counseling interventions and pharmacotherapy. Any harms of combined therapy are assumed to be similar to those of the pharmacotherapy being used.</p>\r\n<h4>Pregnant Persons</h4>\r\n<p><strong>Behavioral counseling intervention.</strong> The primary review that informed the USPSTF on the benefits of behavioral counseling interventions for smoking cessation during pregnancy also summarized evidence on harms of behavioral counseling interventions.<sup>68</sup> Based on analyses of 13 trials (n = 5831), no increase in adverse effects from psychosocial interventions was seen.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Pharmacotherapy.</strong> Nicotine in general has been shown in animal studies to cause fetal harms. However, NRT does not contain many harmful substances, such as hydrogen cyanide and carbon monoxide, that are present in cigarette smoke.<sup>86</sup> Evidence on harms of NRT during pregnancy is limited; the USPSTF identified 5 placebo-controlled trials (n = 3117), 2 non&ndash;placebo-controlled trials (n = 233), and 3 cohort studies (n = 306,721).<sup>13</sup> Findings on potential harms of NRT on birth outcomes from trial evidence is mixed, although most studies reported findings in the direction of benefit rather than harm. Observational evidence from cohort studies generally did not indicate an increase in stillbirth or low birth weight with NRT. Based on observational evidence, there was no evidence of increased risk of premature delivery, small for gestational age, stillbirth, or congenital anomalies associated with the use of NRT, bupropion, and varenicline vs smoking. According to FDA labeling, some fetal harms with bupropion were noted in animal studies, but currently, no adequate, well-controlled studies of bupropion SR use during pregnancy (for any indication) in humans are available.<sup>87</sup> Labeling for varenicline states that available studies cannot definitively establish or exclude varenicline-associated risk during pregnancy.<sup>88</sup></p>\r\n<h4>e-Cigarettes in Nonpregnant Adults and Pregnant Persons</h4>\r\n<p>The USPSTF identified 9 RCTs (n = 3942) that reported on harms of e-cigarette interventions for tobacco smoking cessation in nonpregnant adults<sup>13</sup> (the 5 trials previously described that reported cessation rates at 6 months or more, as well as an additional 4 trials that reported on cessation rates at less than 6 months). No trials on harms of e-cigarettes for smoking cessation in pregnant persons was identified. The most commonly reported adverse effects from e-cigarette use reported in trials include coughing, nausea, throat irritation, and sleep disruption.<sup>13</sup> Generally, no significant difference in short-term serious adverse events associated with e-cigarette use was reported.<sup>13</sup> Data on potential long-term harms of e-cigarette use are currently lacking.</p>\r\n<p>Additional evidence on harms from e-cigarette use (whether used for tobacco cessation or not) considered by the USPSTF included data of the 2019 EVALI outbreak in the US<sup>53</sup> and the 2018 report Public Health Consequences of E-Cigarettes by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.<sup>52</sup> In late 2019, an outbreak of EVALI occurred in the US. Symptoms of EVALI include cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, diarrhea, fever, chills, and weight loss. As of February 2020, more than 2800 cases of EVALI were reported, with 68 deaths.<sup>53</sup> Based on testing of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples of patients with EVALI<sup>89</sup> and testing of products used by patients with EVALI,<sup>53</sup> vitamin E acetate (an additive in some THC-containing e-cigarettes) was found to be strongly linked to EVALI.<sup>53</sup> However, evidence is not sufficient to rule out the contribution of other chemicals of concern, including chemicals in either THC- or non&ndash;THC&ndash;containing products, in some reported EVALI cases.<sup>53</sup></p>\r\n<p>The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine report found that in youth and young adults, there is substantial evidence that e-cigarette use increases risk of ever using combustible tobacco and moderate evidence that e-cigarette use increases the frequency and intensity of subsequent cigarette smoking.<sup>52</sup> The report also found conclusive evidence that e-cigarettes contain and emit potentially toxic substances, although substantial evidence shows that other than nicotine, there is significantly lower exposure to potentially toxic substances from e-cigarettes compared with combustible tobacco cigarettes.<sup>52</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Response to Comments</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from June 2, 2020, to June 29, 2020. Several comments expressed concern about the insufficient evidence statement on e-cigarettes for cessation. Some respondents wanted the USPSTF to recommend against e-cigarettes for tobacco cessation, while others wanted the USPSTF to recommend in favor of e-cigarettes. Based on the evidence reviewed, the USPSTF could not determine whether e-cigarettes are effective in helping persons to quit smoking cigarettes, nor could it determine what the potential long-term harms of e-cigarette use are; thus, it cannot recommend for or against their use. Some comments were also received requesting that the USPSTF recommend NRT for smoking cessation during pregnancy. Too few trials were identified for the USPSTF to determine whether NRT during pregnancy provides overall more benefits or harms, and the USPSTF calls for more research on NRT and other pharmacotherapy to help pregnant persons quit using tobacco. Last, edits to clarify language, as well as additional information from the recent 2020 Surgeon General&rsquo;s Report on Smoking Cessation, have been provided in response to comments.</p>\r\n<h3>How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?</h3>\r\n<p>Because of the well-established health benefits of smoking cessation,<sup>1,12,47</sup> most of the research on interventions for smoking cessation focuses on cessation (rather than health outcomes) as a primary outcome. The current review identified 1 study<sup>90</sup> of middle-aged men at high risk for cardiorespiratory disease that found lower (although not statistically significant) total mortality, fatal coronary disease, and lung cancer death at 20 years of follow-up in participants who received advice from medical practitioners.<sup>91</sup> The study also found some reduction in all-cause mortality, coronary disease mortality, and lung cancer incidence and mortality at 20 years of follow-up, although these outcomes were not significant.<sup>91</sup></p>\r\n<p>Although not zero, less toxins have been found to be released by e-cigarettes than by cigarettes. It is hypothesized that health outcomes may be improved in adults who completely switch from cigarette smoking to e-cigarette use, although long-term data are not available yet to support this. Evidence on long-term harms of e-cigarette use in general is lacking and is needed. Additionally, emerging evidence suggests that toxicant levels in dual users of e-cigarettes and cigarettes may be higher than in conventional cigarette&ndash;only users.<sup>92</sup></p><h2>Research Needs and Gaps</h2><p>The greatest research needs are to gain a better understanding of the effectiveness of e-cigarettes for smoking cessation, as well as potential short- and long-term harms of e-cigarette use, and to understand whether there are effective pharmacotherapy options for pregnant persons.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>e-Cigarettes: Given the potential negative effect that increasing e-cigarette use in youth is having on overall tobacco control efforts, there is an urgent need for research that provides both a clearer understanding of whether e-cigarettes may increase adult tobacco smoking cessation, as well as the potential harms of e-cigarette use as a tobacco product. Future research on e-cigarettes for smoking cessation in adults should address the following:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Studies must be well-designed RCTs that compare e-cigarette interventions with placebo, as well as established, effective combinations of pharmacotherapy and behavioral support.</li>\r\n<li>Studies should be adequately powered to detect differences in continued smoking abstinence rates at 6 months or more.</li>\r\n<li>Given the high rate of continued e-cigarette use after smoking cessation, research on both the short- and long-term harms of e-cigarette use is needed, as well as the harms in dual users of e-cigarettes and conventional cigarettes. More research is needed on smoking relapse rates in adults who have used e-cigarettes for smoking cessation and how to help with cessation of e-cigarette use once smoking abstinence has been achieved.</li>\r\n<li>Given the rapidly evolving landscape of e-cigarettes, trials should include current generations of e-cigarettes. Additionally, to successfully conduct these types of studies, standardization of how to quantify e-cigarette use and levels of nicotine exposure from e-cigarettes is needed.</li>\r\n<li>More research is needed to understand the patterns of e-cigarette use in youth and the risk factors for their transition from e-cigarette use to conventional cigarette smoking.</li>\r\n<li>More research is also needed to better understand patterns of e-cigarette use in pregnant persons and potential harms of e-cigarette use to both pregnant persons and their offspring.</li>\r\n<li>More research is needed on understanding how to help adults quit e-cigarettes.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Pharmacotherapy in pregnant persons: Although behavioral counseling interventions have been found to be effective in improving smoking cessation during pregnancy, additional research is needed on pharmacotherapy options, in particular NRT, for pregnant persons for whom behavioral counseling interventions alone are not effective.\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Larger studies adequately powered to detect an effect on both smoking cessation rates (during pregnancy and postpartum) and changes in perinatal and child health outcomes are needed.</li>\r\n<li>A better understanding of why adherence rates to NRT during pregnancy is so low would also be helpful.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Although the benefits of behavioral counseling interventions and pharmacotherapy in nonpregnant adults and the benefits of behavioral counseling interventions in pregnant adults are well established, additional research on effective components of behavioral counseling and who to target specific interventions to would be informative. More research on newer modalities and remotely delivered interventions (mobile phone apps, internet-based interventions) would also be helpful. Additionally, the effectiveness of interventions for cessation of other forms of tobacco and whether interventions need to be tailored to individual tobacco product types are also needed. Last, more research is needed on interventions to prevent relapse of tobacco use.</p><h2>Recommendations of Others</h2><p>Numerous professional societies and health organizations, including the American Academy of Family Physicians,<sup>93</sup> American College of Physicians,<sup>94</sup> and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG),<sup>95</sup> recommend that clinicians screen for tobacco use and provide interventions to patients who smoke.</p>\r\n<p>For pregnant persons, ACOG recommends brief behavioral counseling and the use of evidence-based smoking cessation aids as effective strategies for achieving smoking cessation, even for very heavy smokers.<sup>96</sup> ACOG also recommends that NRT should be considered only after a detailed discussion with the patient of the known risks of continued smoking, the possible risks of NRT, and need for close supervision.<sup>95</sup></p>\r\n<p>The American Academy of Pediatrics also has a policy statement recommending that pediatricians screen for the tobacco exposure of children during pediatric care visits and recommend nicotine dependence treatment, including behavioral interventions and pharmacotherapy, to tobacco-dependent parents.<sup>97</sup></p>\r\n<p>More recently some organizations have addressed e-cigarette use in their tobacco use guidelines. The American Academy of Family Physicians,<sup>98</sup> the American College of Preventive Medicine,<sup>99</sup> and the American Heart Association<sup>100</sup> recommend that clinicians screen for e-cigarette use. Organizations vary somewhat in terms of whether they recommend e-cigarettes for smoking cessation. ACOG recommends against use of e-cigarettes in pregnant and postpartum individuals.<sup>95,101</sup> The American Cancer Society does not recommend e-cigarettes as a smoking cessation method,<sup>102</sup> and the American Heart Association<sup>100</sup> states that there is not enough evidence for clinicians to counsel patients on using e-cigarettes as a primary smoking cessation aid.</p>","topic":"Tobacco Smoking Cessation in Adults, Including Pregnant Persons: Interventions","keywords":"Tobacco Use|Smoking|ENDS|cigarette|nicotine|cessation","pubDate":"2021-01-19","categories":["3","8","1"],"tool":["256","263","262","261","260","259","258","257"]},"430":{"topicType":"Counseling","topicYear":2020,"uspstfAlias":"sexually-transmitted-infections-behavioral-counseling","specific":[1445],"title":"Sexually Transmitted Infections: Behavioral Counseling","rationale":"<h2>Importance</h2><p>Bacterial and viral sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are common in the US.

In the US, common STIs with significant clinical and public health effects include HIV, herpes simplex virus, human papillomavirus (HPV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em>, <em>Neisseria gonorrhea</em>, <em>Treponema pallidum</em> (syphilis), and <em>Trichomonas vaginalis</em>.<sup>1-4</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>\r\n<p>All sexually active adolescents are at increased risk for STIs because of the high rates of STIs in this age group and should receive behavioral counseling interventions. Adults at increased risk for STIs include those who currently have an STI or were diagnosed with one within the past year, do not consistently use condoms, have multiple sex partners, or have sex partners within populations with a high prevalence of STIs. Populations with a high prevalence of STIs include persons who seek STI testing or attend STI clinics; sexual and gender minorities; persons who are living with HIV, inject drugs, have exchanged sex for money or drugs, or have entered correctional facilities; and some racial/ethnic minority groups.<sup>1-4</sup> Difference in STI rates among racial/ethnic groups may reflect differences in social determinants of health.<sup>2</sup> To determine which adolescents are sexually active, and which adults might engage in activities that may increase their risk for STIs, clinicians should routinely ask their patients for pertinent information about their sexual history.</p>\r\n<h3>Behavioral Counseling Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>Intervention approaches include in-person counseling, videos, websites, written materials, telephone support, and text messages. Most successful approaches provide information on common STIs and STI transmission; assess the person&rsquo;s risk for acquiring STIs; aim to increase motivation or commitment to safer sex practices; and provide training in condom use, communication about safer sex, problem solving, and other pertinent skills. Interventions that include group counseling and involve high total contact times (defined in the evidence review as more than 120 minutes), often delivered over multiple sessions, are associated with larger STI prevention effects. However, some less intensive interventions have been shown to reduce STI acquisition, increase condom use, or decrease number of sex partners.

Most reported STI outcomes after 12 or more months of follow-up. About one-half of trials were conducted in, or recruited participants from, US STI clinics. Other trials recruited participants from primary care, adolescent health, family planning, women&rsquo;s health, or behavioral health clinics, mostly in the US. A few trials recruited participants directly from the community. Nine trials enrolled members of populations with higher rates of STIs such as sexually active adolescents or young adults and persons who reported unprotected intercourse, sex with multiple concurrent sex partners, or other STI risk behaviors. Eleven trials enrolled persons classified as at &ldquo;highest risk for STI&rdquo; who had current, recent, or suspected STI diagnosis or were attending STI clinics. Most participants were younger than 25 years, female, heterosexual, and reported African American or Hispanic race/ethnicity, and most trials specifically enrolled subpopulations defined by race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, age, gender, pregnancy, or other factors.</p>\r\n<p>Many interventions used techniques or concepts from motivational interviewing, cognitive behavioral therapy, or other established behavioral counseling approaches that aimed to increase STI risk perception, knowledge, motivation, and skills for preventing STI acquisition; to increase consistent condom use; and to reduce unprotected intercourse and the number and concurrency of sex partners. Interventions for adolescents who were not yet sexually active aimed to delay sexual activity or encourage abstinence. Interventions were delivered in person and through computer, video, telephone, text message, or print formats over 1 or more sessions. A majority of the interventions that were shorter than 30 minutes delivered the content in a single session. Control conditions included usual care, attention controls, wait list, or minimal interventions (such as less than 15 minutes of STI information).</p>\r\n<p>Behavioral counseling interventions were effective for reducing STI acquisition by approximately 30% based on pooled analysis of 19 trials in persons at increased risk for STIs, of which 10 trials enrolled persons at highest risk (n = 52,072; odds ratio [OR], 0.66 [95% CI, 0.54-0.81]; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 74%). Sexually transmitted infection prevention effects were stronger for interventions involving group counseling (8 trials; n = 6567; OR, 0.47 [95% CI, 0.28-0.78]; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 75%) than for interventions without group counseling (11 trials; n = 45,505; OR, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.74-1.08]; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 43%) (<em>P</em> = 0.02). Effects were also stronger for interventions with high total contact times (&gt;120 minutes) (8 trials; n = 3974; OR, 0.46 [95% CI, 0.28-0.75; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 65%) (<em>P</em> = 0.02) than for interventions with moderate total contact times (30 to 120 minutes) (8 trials; n = 9072; OR, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.66-1.25]; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 59%) or low total contact times (&lt;30 minutes) (4 trials; n = 39,230; OR, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.36-1.24]; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 44%). However, it was unclear whether group counseling format, contact time, or both were responsible for intervention effects because all but 1 group counseling intervention entailed more than 120 minutes.<sup>25,34</sup></p>\r\n<p>Although interventions with more than 120 minutes of contact time, group counseling, or both were generally more effective, 3 interventions with moderate<sup>11,14</sup> or low<sup>19</sup> contact times and 2 interventions without group counseling<sup>14,19</sup> yielded statistically significant reductions in STI acquisition in STI clinic patients. One brief, video-based intervention without in-person counseling was tested in a nonrandomized clinical trial of 40,282 adults in STI clinic waiting rooms.<sup>19</sup> Patients who viewed 23 minutes of information about HIV and STI prevention; how couples communicate about newly diagnosed STIs; building skills, self-efficacy, and positive attitudes about condom use; and how to acquire, negotiate, and use condoms were significantly less likely than patients receiving usual care to acquire STIs after a mean of 15 months of follow-up (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.84-0.99]).</p>\r\n<p>Meta-regression analysis revealed that intervention effects were stronger in trials limited to adolescents (3 trials; n = 1166; OR, 0.22 [95% CI, 0.02-2.30]; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 73%) than in trials that included adolescents and adults (16 trials; n = 50,906; OR, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.67-0.91]; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 51%). However, it was difficult to isolate specific effects because the most effective intervention format (interventions involving group counseling) was tested in trials with similar participant characteristics (girls and women who identified as racial/ethnic minorities), and only 1 trial of adolescents included boys.<sup>25,34</sup></p>\r\n<p>Thirty-four trials evaluated self-reported behavioral outcomes at least 3 months after interventions started in adolescents, young adults, or older adults, most of whom were at increased risk for STIs (30 trials). Intervention and participant characteristics were similar to those in trials that assessed STI outcomes. Behavioral counseling interventions were effective for increasing condom use, specifically dichotomous measures of consistent condom use or condom use at last sexual encounter (13 trials; n = 5253; OR, 1.31 [95% CI, 1.10-1.56]; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 40%) and for decreasing unprotected intercourse based on number of sexual acts or days of intercourse without a condom (14 trials; n = 9183; mean difference, &ndash;0.94 [95% CI, &ndash;1.40 to &ndash;0.48]; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 16%).<sup>25,34</sup></p>\r\n<p>Several trials found that interventions with high contact time were significantly associated with increased condom use or reductions in unprotected sex or the number of sex partners.<sup>25,34</sup> Two interventions with moderate contact time were also significantly associated with increased condom use<sup>14,35</sup> or abstinence from vaginal sex.<sup>36</sup> One intervention with low contact time that sent adolescents and young adults numerous emails with links to STI information and motivational content was significantly associated with a reduction in unprotected sex.<sup>37</sup> Most of the 8 trials that reported both STI acquisition and behavioral outcomes found that persons reporting more consistent condom use were less likely to acquire STIs.<sup>25,34</sup></p>\r\n<p>Four trials evaluated behavioral counseling interventions in adults or adolescents at average STI risk who were recruited without respect to individual STI risk factors from primary care clinics (3 trials) or through community advertising (1 trial).<sup>25,34</sup> None reported significant effects on STI acquisition. One trial found a significant effect on self-reported sexual behavior in adolescents aged 11 to 14 years (of whom most were not yet sexually active) who enrolled with their mothers in a multisession family therapy intervention that was endorsed by their clinician and aimed to reduce adolescent sexual activity. After 9 months of follow-up, adolescents in the intervention group were less likely to report vaginal intercourse than adolescents offered usual care (OR, 0.24 [95% CI, 0.11-0.55]).<sup>36</sup> A recent follow-up study using an updated version of the intervention in a broader group found similar results.<sup>38</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Behavioral Counseling Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>Seven of the trials that assessed STI or behavioral outcomes (n = 3458) also reported on potential harms of interventions in adolescents or adults at increased risk for STIs. None of these trials reported significant harms.<sup>25,34</sup> There was no consistent evidence that interventions increased sexual activity in adolescents, unintended pregnancy, perceptions of shame or stigma, or mental health problems.</p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from December 17, 2019, through January 21, 2020. Many comments requested clarification about taking a sexual history and identifying which adults are considered at increased risk for STIs. In response, the USPSTF added clarifying language to the Risk Assessment section. Comments seeking additional clarification on recommended interventions were also received. Where the USPSTF was able to provide more details, it did so in the Behavioral Counseling Interventions subsection of the Practice Considerations section. Comments also highlighted additional research needs, which have been included in the Research Needs and Gaps section. Some comments requested that the current recommendation discuss HIV preexposure prophylaxis; HIV preexposure prophylaxis is addressed in a separate USPSTF recommendation.<sup>32</sup> A few comments requested clearer guidance on how to provide counseling in situations in which the sexual activity is not in the control of the patient (such as sexual trafficking or abuse). The USPSTF acknowledges the importance of helping persons in this situation, which goes beyond counseling on how to prevent STIs. The USPSTF added a link to relevant resources provided by the CDC in the Additional Tools and Resources section.</p><h2>Research Needs and Gaps</h2><p>Most studies identified by the USPSTF enrolled heterosexual girls, women, and men at increased risk for STI acquisition. More research on counseling interventions to prevent STIs is needed in sexually active boys; pregnant persons; gay, lesbian, bisexual, nonbinary, and transgender persons; and older adults at increased risk; as well as in adolescents who are not yet sexually active. Research on interventions that engage couples or sex partners of primary care patients is also needed. More national-level data on prevalence of STIs in certain risk groups are also needed, including lesbian, bisexual, nonbinary, and transgender persons. Additional research is needed on understanding the role of social determinants of health in contributing to increased STI rates.</p>\r\n<p>Few trials incorporated sexual risk assessment performed by primary care clinicians, and less than one-half of trials assessed interventions delivered by clinicians, nurses, psychologists, or other health professionals. Because many trials were conducted in STI clinics, research that is more applicable to general primary care populations would be valuable, such as trials that test interventions delivered in primary care settings, obstetrics clinics, and family planning and women&rsquo;s health clinics, or that is endorsed by primary care clinicians for patients who report increased STI risk based on well-defined risk assessment methods.</p>\r\n<p>Trials that follow up participants for longer than 12 months are needed to assess the durability of intervention effects.</p>\r\n<p>Research is needed to develop and test interventions that could extend group counseling to remote participants (such as interactive telemedicine) and that would be more feasible for asymptomatic patients in general primary care settings, such as brief or media-based interventions involving less than 30 minutes.</p><h2>Recommendations of Others</h2><p>The CDC recommends that all clinicians routinely obtain a sexual history and encourage abstinence, condom use, limiting number of sex partners, and other sexual risk&ndash;reduction strategies,<sup>4,39</sup> as well as routine vaccination against HPV and HBV infection.<sup>40,41</sup> Many organizations advise clinicians to periodically obtain sexual histories, conduct sexual risk assessments, discuss sexual risk reduction, or some combination thereof; these organizations include the American Academy of Pediatrics,<sup>42</sup> the American Academy of Family Physicians,<sup>43</sup> the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,<sup>44-49</sup> the Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine,<sup>50</sup> the National Coalition of Sexually Transmitted Disease Directors and the National Alliance of State and Territorial AIDS Directors,<sup>51</sup> and the National Health Care for the Homeless Council.<sup>52</sup> Although it does not address STI prevention counseling directly, the Sexual Assault Forensic Examiner Technical Assistance Organization provides guidance on how to evaluate and provide STI care to persons who have experienced sexual assault.<sup>53</sup></p>","topic":"Sexually Transmitted Infections: Behavioral Counseling","keywords":"Sexually Transmitted Infections|STI|STD","pubDate":"2020-08-18","categories":["11"],"tool":["264","267","266","265"]},"431":{"topicType":"Counseling","topicYear":2021,"uspstfAlias":"healthy-weight-and-weight-gain-during-pregnancy-behavioral-counseling-interventions","specific":[1931],"title":"Healthy Weight and Weight Gain In Pregnancy: Behavioral Counseling Interventions","rationale":"<h2>Importance</h2><p>The prevalence of overweight and obesity is increasing among persons of childbearing age and pregnant persons.<sup>1</sup> Obesity rates during pregnancy increased from 13% in 1993 to 24% in 2015.<sup>1</sup> In 2015, almost half of all persons began pregnancy with overweight (24%) or obesity (24%).<sup>1,2</sup> Prepregnancy obesity is higher in Alaska Native/American Indian (36.4%), Black (34.7%), and Hispanic (27.3%) women compared with White women (23.7%).

These weight gain guidelines are for singleton pregnancies.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><em>Gestational weight gain</em> is defined as the change in weight from before pregnancy (prepregnancy or during the first trimester) to the weight measured prior to delivery.<sup>5</sup> The National Academy of Medicine (formerly known as the Institute of Medicine) recommendations for healthy GWG are 28 to 40 lb in the prepregnancy underweight category, 25 to 35 lb for the normal prepregnancy weight category, 15 to 25 lb for the prepregnancy overweight category, and 11 to 20 lb for the prepregnancy obese category.<sup>5</sup></li>\r\n<li>Prepregnancy weight categories are based on the World Health Organization categories for nonpregnant persons: underweight (body mass index [BMI] &lt;18.5 [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared]), normal or healthy weight (BMI 18.5-24.9), overweight (BMI 25-29.9), and obese (BMI &ge;30).<sup>5-7</sup></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Behavioral Counseling Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>Effective behavioral counseling interventions to promote healthy weight gain in pregnancy are associated with decreased risk of gestational diabetes mellitus, emergency cesarean delivery, infant macrosomia, and LGA infants.<sup>1</sup> Behavioral counseling interventions varied in included components. Some interventions had an individual focus on nutrition, physical activity, or lifestyle and behavioral change. Other interventions had multiple components. The most common types of behavioral counseling interventions included active or supervised exercise or counseling about diet and physical activity.<sup>1</sup> Interventions generally started at the end of the first trimester or the beginning of the second trimester and ended prior to delivery. Intervention sessions lasted from 15 to 120 minutes and ranged from fewer than 2 to 12 or more contacts. Interventionists were highly diverse and included clinicians, registered dietitians, qualified fitness specialists, physiotherapists, and health coaches. Trials used various delivery methods (face-to-face, computer, internet, or telephone).<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<p>Effective behavioral counseling interventions often referred participants to various interventionists in different settings (eg, local community fitness center). Participants were counseled on healthy diet and exercise through individual or group education sessions. Some interventions provided medically supervised group exercise classes with or without counseling.<sup>1</sup> Behavioral counseling interventions with 12 or more contacts were more effective for some outcomes (mean GWG, excess GWG, and infant macrosomia) than interventions with fewer contacts.<sup>1</sup> There is not enough evidence to determine whether specific components of these interventions were independently related to intervention effectiveness.</p>\r\n<h3>Implementation</h3>\r\n<p>Primary care clinicians can deliver effective in-person behavioral counseling interventions or refer patients to behavioral counseling interventions in other settings.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) Grades and Levels of Evidence</p>","other":"<h2>Supporting Evidence</h2><h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF commissioned a systematic review<sup>1,31</sup> to evaluate the benefits and harms of behavioral counseling interventions to prevent adverse health outcomes associated with obesity during pregnancy and to evaluate intermediate outcomes, including excess GWG. The USPSTF has not previously made a recommendation on this topic.</p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Counseling Interventions to Change Behavior</h3>\r\n<p>Sixty-four randomized clinical trials and 4 nonrandomized controlled intervention studies evaluated interventions to promote healthy weight gain and limit excessive GWG during pregnancy.</p>\r\n<p>Study sample sizes ranged from 50 to 2261; the total number of participants in all included studies was 25,789. The mean reported age ranged from 18 to 33 years.<sup>1,31</sup> None of the studies exclusively enrolled pregnant adolescents or pregnant adults of advanced maternal age. BMI inclusion criteria varied across the trials; there were participants with overweight or obesity (19 trials), those with obesity only (13 trials), those with mixed weight status (34 trials), and those with normal weight only (1 trial). Twenty-eight of the 68 included studies (41%) enrolled more than 20% of patients from diverse backgrounds, including persons who are socioeconomically disadvantaged, racial/ethnic populations, rural populations, or others. Twenty-two studies provided an intervention with an activity component, while 45 studies offered counseling-only interventions. The mean weight loss after the interventions was approximately 1 kg across the trials.<sup>1,31</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Maternal Health Outcomes</h4>\r\n<p>Gestational weight gain interventions were associated with statistically significant reductions in risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (43 trials; relative risk [RR], 0.87 [95% CI, 0.79 to 0.95]; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 16.4%; absolute risk difference [ARD], &minus;1.6% [95% CI, &minus;2.5% to &minus;0.7%]) and emergency (unscheduled) cesarean delivery (134 trials; RR, 0.875 [95% CI, 0.754 to 0.986]; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 0%; ARD, &minus;2.24% [95% CI, &minus;4.20% to 0.03%]). There was no association between GWG interventions and gestational hypertension, total number of cesarean deliveries, preeclampsia, postpartum hemorrhage, perineal trauma, or maternal death.<sup>1,31</sup> Stratified analyses showed statistically significant interactions between the mixed BMI category and perineal trauma, active interventions and gestational hypertension, high-intensity interventions and gestational hypertension, and intervention intensity and perineal trauma.</p>\r\n<h4>Infant Health Outcomes</h4>\r\n<p>Gestational weight gain interventions were associated with decreased risk of infant macrosomia (25 trials; RR, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.65 to 0.92]; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 38.3%; ARD, &minus;1.9% [95% CI, &minus;3.3% to &minus;0.7%]) and LGA in infants (26 trials; RR, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.80 to 0.99]; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 0%; ARD, &minus;1.3 [95% CI, &minus;2.3% to &minus;0.3%]).<sup>1,31</sup> However, the interventions were not associated with changes in growth rates during the first year of life or in risk of preterm birth, neonatal death or stillbirth, shoulder dystocia, admission to the neonatal intensive care unit, or respiratory distress syndrome. Stratified analyses showed statistically significant interactions between intervention intensity and infant macrosomia (<em>P</em> = .03 for interaction) but no effect on other infant outcomes by BMI category, intervention type, or intervention intensity.<sup>1,31</sup> Evidence suggested that some specific pregnancy-related intermediate outcomes are associated with health outcomes. Macrosomia and LGA in infants were associated with an increased risk of maternal and infant complications during birth.</p>\r\n<h4>Maternal Weight Outcomes</h4>\r\n<p>Gestational weight gain interventions were associated with 1 kg less weight gain across all prepregnancy weight categories (55 trials; pooled mean difference [MD], &minus;1.02 kg [95% CI, &minus;1.30 to &minus;0.75 kg]; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 60.3%). High-intensity interventions (&ge;12 contacts) were associated with greater effects (28 trials; pooled MD, &minus;1.47 kg [95% CI, &minus;1.78 to &minus;1.22 kg]; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 13.0%) than were moderate-intensity interventions (3-11 contacts) (18 trials; pooled MD, &minus;0.32 kg [95% CI, &minus;0.71 to &minus;0.04 kg]; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 17.6%) or low-intensity interventions (&le;2 contacts) (9 trials; pooled MD, &minus;0.64 kg [95% CI, &minus;1.44 to 0.02 kg]; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 48.4%; <em>P</em> &lt; .001 for interaction). There was no significant interaction between intervention type or baseline BMI category and effects on GWG. Interventions were also associated with a lower likelihood of GWG in excess of the National Academy of Medicine recommendations (39 trials; RR, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.78 to 0.90]; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 63.2%; ARD, &minus;7.7% [95% CI, &minus;11.0% to &minus;4.6%]), with greater effect size for active interventions (<em>P</em> &lt; .001 for interaction) and high-intensity interventions (<em>P</em> &lt; .001 for interaction). There was no significant interaction between BMI category and effects on likelihood of excess weight gain. Gestational weight gain interventions were not associated with increased likelihood of adherence to National Academy of Medicine recommendations for GWG (ie, neither gaining excessive weight nor failing to gain sufficient weight) or postpartum weight retention at less than 6 months but were associated with reduced postpartum weight retention at 12 months (10 trials; pooled MD, &minus;0.63 kg [95% CI, &minus;1.44 to &minus;0.01 kg]; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 65.5%).<sup>1,31</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Counseling Interventions to Change Behavior</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found limited evidence on harms because most studies were not designed to evaluate harms. Twelve studies evaluated the effects of GWG interventions on maternal anxiety and depression and showed mixed results.<sup>1</sup> The association between GWG interventions and small for gestational age size in infants was not statistically significant (20 trials; RR, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.80 to 1.10]; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 0%; ARD, &minus;0.4% [95% CI, &minus;1.7% to 1.0%]).<sup>1</sup> Gestational weight gain interventions were not associated with maternal death (2 trials); however, there were low event rates and few trials.<sup>1,31</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comments</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from December 8, 2020, to January 11, 2021. Comments asked for clarification of the patient population. The USPSTF revised the Practice Considerations section to clarify that the patient population under consideration included pregnant adolescents and adults and to more clearly define &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; weight.

Lower level of education is also associated with a higher risk of lung cancer.<sup>7</sup> The USPSTF recommends using age and smoking history to determine screening eligibility rather than more elaborate risk prediction models because there is insufficient evidence to assess whether risk prediction model&ndash;based screening would improve outcomes relative to using the risk factors of age and smoking history for broad implementation in primary care.</p>\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>Low-dose computed tomography has high sensitivity and reasonable specificity for the detection of lung cancer, with demonstrated benefit in screening persons at high risk.<sup>9-11</sup> Other potential screening modalities that are not recommended because they have not been found to be beneficial include sputum cytology, chest radiography, and measurement of biomarker levels.<sup>12,13</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Screening Intervals</h3>\r\n<p>The 2 lung cancer screening trials that showed a benefit of lung cancer screening used different screening intervals. The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) screened annually for 3 years.<sup>10</sup> The Nederlands-Leuvens Longkanker Screenings Onderzoek (NELSON) trial screened at intervals of 1 year, then 2 years, then 2.5 years.<sup>11</sup> Modeling studies from the Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET)<sup>14,15</sup> suggest that annual screening for lung cancer leads to greater benefit than does biennial screening. Based on the available evidence and these models, the USPSTF recommends annual screening.</p>\r\n<h3>Treatment and Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>Lung cancer can be treated with surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapies, immunotherapy, or combinations of these treatments.<sup>16</sup> Surgical resection is generally considered the current treatment of choice for patients with stage I or II non&ndash;small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).<sup>17</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Implementation of Lung Cancer Screening</h3>\r\n<p>Available data indicate that uptake of lung cancer screening is low. One recent study using data for 10 states found that 14.4% of persons eligible for lung cancer screening (based on 2013 USPSTF criteria) had been screened in the prior 12 months.<sup>18</sup> Increasing lung cancer screening discussions and offering screening to eligible persons who express a preference for it is a key step to realizing the potential benefit of lung cancer screening.<em>&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n<h4>Screening Eligibility, Screening Intervals, and Starting and Stopping Ages</h4>\r\n<p>As noted above, the USPSTF recommends annual screening for lung cancer with LDCT in adults aged 50 to 80 years who have at least a 20 pack-year smoking history. Screening should be discontinued once a person has not smoked for 15 years.</p>\r\n<p>The NLST<sup>9</sup> and the NELSON trial<sup>11</sup> enrolled generally healthy persons, so those study findings may not accurately reflect the balance of benefits and harms in persons with comorbid conditions. The USPSTF recommends discontinuing screening if a person develops a health problem that substantially limits life expectancy or the ability or willingness to have curative lung surgery.<em>&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n<h4>Smoking Cessation Counseling</h4>\r\n<p>All persons enrolled in a screening program who are current smokers should receive smoking cessation interventions. To be consistent with the USPSTF recommendation on counseling and interventions to prevent tobacco use and tobacco-caused disease,<sup>19</sup> persons referred for lung cancer screening through primary care should receive these interventions concurrent with referral. Because many persons may enter screening through pathways besides referral from primary care, the USPSTF encourages incorporating such interventions into all screening programs.<em>&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n<h4>Shared Decision-Making</h4>\r\n<p>Shared decision-making is important when clinicians and patients discuss screening for lung cancer. The benefit of screening varies with risk because persons at higher risk are more likely to benefit. Screening does not prevent most lung cancer deaths; thus, smoking cessation remains essential. Lung cancer screening has the potential to cause harm, including false-positive results and incidental findings that can lead to subsequent testing and treatment, including the anxiety of living with a lung lesion that may be cancer. Overdiagnosis of lung cancer and the risks of radiation exposure are harms, although their exact magnitude is uncertain. The decision to undertake screening should involve a thorough discussion of the potential benefits, limitations, and harms of screening.<em>&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n<h4>Standardization of LDCT Screening and Follow-up of Abnormal Findings</h4>\r\n<p>The randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that provide evidence for the benefit of screening for lung cancer with LDCT were primarily conducted in academic centers with expertise in the performance and interpretation of LDCT and the management of lung lesions seen on LDCT. Clinical settings that have similar experience and expertise are more likely to duplicate the beneficial results found in trials.</p>\r\n<p>In an effort to minimize the uncertainty and variation about the evaluation and management of lung nodules and to standardize the reporting of LDCT screening results, the American College of Radiology developed the Lung Imaging Reporting and Data System (Lung-RADS) classification system and endorses its use in lung cancer screening.<sup>20</sup> Lung-RADS provides guidance to clinicians on which findings are suspicious for cancer and the suggested management of lung nodules detected on LDCT. Data suggest that the use of Lung-RADS may decrease the rate of false-positive results in lung cancer screening.<sup>21</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Additional Tools and Resources</h3>\r\n<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has several websites with many resources to help patients stop smoking:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>&ldquo;How to Quit&rdquo; resources (<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/quit\">https://www.cdc.gov/quit</a>)</li>\r\n<li>Smoking Cessation: Fast Facts (<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/cessation/smoking-cessation-fast-facts/\">https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/cessation/smoking-cessation-fast-facts/</a>)</li>\r\n<li>Tips From Former Smokers (<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/campaign/tips/\">https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/campaign/tips/</a>)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The National Cancer Institute has developed resources to help patients stop smoking (<a href=\"https://www.smokefree.gov/\">https://www.smokefree.gov</a>).

In 2013 the USPSTF recommended annual screening for lung cancer with LDCT in adults aged 55 to 80 years who have a 30 pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years (abbreviated as A-55-80-30-15).<sup>23</sup> For this updated recommendation, the USPSTF has changed the age range and pack-year eligibility criteria and recommends annual screening for lung cancer with LDCT in adults aged 50 to 80 years who have a 20 pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years (A-50-80-20-15). Abbreviations for screening recommendations are expanded in the <a href=\"#Box\">Box</a>.</p>\r\n<p>As in the 2013 recommendation, the USPSTF recommends that screening should be discontinued once a person has not smoked for 15 years or develops a health problem that substantially limits life expectancy or the ability or willingness to have curative lung surgery.</p><h2>Box.

The review also assessed whether the benefits of screening vary by subgroup (eg, by race or sex) or by the number or frequency of LDCT scans and whether the harms associated with screening and the evaluation of lung nodules differ with the use of Lung-RADS, International Early Lung Cancer Action Program (I-ELCAP), or similar approaches (eg, to reduce false-positive results). In addition, the review assessed whether the use of risk prediction models for identifying adults at higher risk of lung cancer mortality improves the balance of benefits and harms of screening compared with the use of trial eligibility criteria or variants of the prior USPSTF recommendation criteria.</p>\r\n<p>In addition to the systematic evidence review, the USPSTF commissioned collaborative modeling studies from CISNET<sup>14,15</sup> to provide information about the optimal age at which to begin and end screening, the optimal screening interval, and the relative benefits and harms of different screening strategies, including risk factor&ndash;based strategies using age, pack-year smoking history, and years since quitting smoking for former smokers, compared with modified versions of multivariate risk prediction models. The modeling studies complement the evidence that the systematic review provides.</p>\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed several RCTs and cohort studies that reported on the sensitivity, specificity, or predictive value of LDCT, using eventual diagnosis of lung cancer as the reference standard.<sup>24,25</sup> Not all of the reviewed studies reported all test accuracy data. In the studies that reported it, sensitivity ranged from 59% to 100%, specificity ranged from 26.4% to 99.7%, positive predictive value ranged from 3.3% to 43.5%, and negative predictive value ranged from 97.7% to 100%.</p>\r\n<p>In the NLST<sup>26</sup> and NELSON trial,<sup>11</sup> the reported sensitivities were 93.1% and 59%, respectively, and reported specificities were 76.5% and 95.8%, respectively. Although the negative predictive values were similar for the NLST and NELSON trial (99.9% and 97.7%, respectively), the positive predictive values were very different (3.3% and 43.5%, respectively). This discrepancy is largely accounted for by the trials&rsquo; differing definitions of a positive finding and screening protocols&mdash;the NELSON trial used a volumetric approach and added an indeterminate nodule result category (ie, an indeterminate finding was not considered a positive result even if it led to additional testing). The NLST used an approach of maximum diameter without an indeterminate category (ie, any nodule meeting the diameter criteria was considered a positive result).</p>\r\n<p>Three retrospective studies compared how various approaches for nodule classification would alter the accuracy of LDCT.<sup>21,27,28</sup> The first study demonstrated that using Lung-RADS in the NLST would have increased specificity while decreasing sensitivity.<sup>21</sup> The other 2 studies found that use of I-ELCAP criteria (increase in nodule size threshold to an average diameter of 5 mm, 6 mm, or larger) would increase positive predictive value.<sup>27,28</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed 7 RCTs that evaluated lung cancer screening with LDCT.<sup>24,25</sup> The NLST<sup>9</sup> and the NELSON trial<sup>11</sup> were the only trials adequately powered to detect a lung cancer mortality benefit.</p>\r\n<p>The NLST, the largest RCT to date (n = 53,454), enrolled participants aged 55 to 74 years at the time of randomization who had a tobacco use history of at least 30 pack-years and were current smokers or had quit within the past 15 years. The mean pack-year smoking history in NLST participants was 56 pack-years.<sup>9</sup> The NELSON trial (n = 15,792) enrolled participants aged 50 to 74 years who had a tobacco use history of at least 15 cigarettes a day (three-fourths of a pack per day) for more than 25 years or 10 cigarettes a day (one-half of a pack per day) for more than 30 years and were current smokers or had quit within the past 10 years. The median pack-year smoking history in NELSON trial participants was 38 pack-years.<sup>11</sup></p>\r\n<p>The NLST reported a relative risk reduction in lung cancer mortality of 20% (95% CI, 6.8%-26.7%)9; a subsequent analysis of NLST data with additional follow-up and end point verification reported a relative risk reduction of 16% (95% CI, 5%-25%).<sup>10</sup> At 10 years of follow-up, the NELSON trial reported 181 lung cancer deaths among participants in the screening group and 242 in the control group (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.75 [95% CI, 0.61-0.90]).<sup>11,24</sup> The NLST also found a reduction in all-cause mortality with LDCT screening compared with chest radiography (IRR, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.88-0.99]). Results of the other trials were imprecise, without any statistically significant differences between screening with LDCT and chest radiography or no screening.<sup>24</sup></p>\r\n<p>Evidence on screening interval comes from the NLST and the NELSON trial and CISNET modeling studies. The NLST screened annually for 3 years.<sup>9</sup> The NELSON trial screened at intervals of 1 year, then 2 years, then 2.5 years.<sup>11</sup> The CISNET modeling studies suggest that annual screening with LDCT provides greater benefit in decreasing lung cancer mortality and in life-years gained compared with biennial screening.<sup>14</sup></p>\r\n<p>Several lines of evidence suggest that screening for lung cancer in persons with fewer pack-years of smoking (ie, fewer than the 30 pack-year eligibility criterion of the 2013 USPSTF recommendation) and at an earlier age can increase the benefits of screening. As noted, the NELSON trial enrolled persons aged 50 to 74 years (about one-fourth of participants were younger than 55 years) who had accumulated fewer pack-years of smoking (half of a pack per day for more than 30 years or three-fourths of a pack per day for more than 25 years).<sup>11</sup> This trial provides empirical evidence for the benefit of screening for lung cancer with LDCT in persons aged 50 to 55 years and with lighter pack-year smoking histories.</p>\r\n<p>The CISNET modeling studies also provided data that helped inform the pack-year eligibility criterion for lung cancer screening and the ages at which to start and stop screening. The USPSTF focused on screening programs in the 1960 birth cohort (more representative of current smoking patterns compared with earlier cohorts) that yielded lung cancer mortality reductions at least as great as the 2013 USPSTF screening program (A-55-80-30-15). For screening programs that provide this level of mortality benefit and also maximize, or come close to maximizing, both lung cancer deaths averted and life-years gained for any given level of LDCT screening, in at least 3 of the 4 CISNET models (ie, &ldquo;consensus-efficient&rdquo; programs), the majority (52%) have a minimum pack-year eligibility criterion of 20 pack-years. Almost all have a starting age of 50 or 55 years, and all have a stopping age of 80 years.<sup>14,15</sup></p>\r\n<p>Relative to the 2013 USPSTF screening program (A-55-80-30-15), CISNET modeling analyses suggest that annually screening persons aged 50 to 80 years who have at least a 20 pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years (A-50-80-20-15) would be associated with lung cancer mortality reduced by 13.0% vs 9.8%, with avoiding 503 vs 381 lung cancer deaths, and with 6918 life-years gained vs 4882 life-years gained per 100,000 persons in the population aged 45 to 90 years over a lifetime of screening.<sup>14</sup> Thus, this screening program would be associated with important reductions in lung cancer deaths and increases in life-years gained compared with the previous recommendation and is supported by new trial data and the CISNET modeling studies.</p>\r\n<p>Screening for lung cancer in persons at an earlier age and with fewer pack-years of smoking (ie, 20 pack-years) may also help partially ameliorate racial disparities in screening eligibility. Data suggest that Black persons who smoke have a higher risk of lung cancer than do White persons, and this risk difference is more apparent at lower levels of smoking intensity.<sup>7</sup> One recent analysis of Southern Community Cohort Study participants found that 17% of Black persons who smoke were eligible for lung cancer screening based on the 2013 USPSTF eligibility criteria compared with 31% of White persons who smoke. In the same study, among persons diagnosed with lung cancer, a significantly lower percentage of Black persons who smoke (32%) were eligible for screening than were White persons (56%).<sup>29</sup> Data also suggest that Latinx/Hispanic persons who smoke accumulate fewer pack-years than White persons who smoke.<sup>30,31</sup> A strategy of annually screening persons aged 50 to 80 years who have at least a 20 pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years (A-50-80-20-15) would increase the relative percentage of persons eligible for screening by 87% overall&mdash;78% in non-Hispanic White adults, 107% in non-Hispanic Black adults, and 112% in Hispanic adults compared with 2013 USPSTF criteria (A-55-80-30-15).<sup>14</sup> Similarly, a strategy of screening persons aged 50 to 80 years who have at least a 20 pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years (A-50-80-20-15) would increase the relative percentage of persons eligible for screening by 80% in men and by 96% in women,<sup>14</sup> because they accumulate fewer pack-years than men.<sup>32</sup></p>\r\n<p>Simulation studies suggest that risk prediction models to determine eligibility for lung cancer screening could be associated with reduced lung cancer deaths and the number of participants needed to screen to prevent 1 lung cancer death. The CISNET modeling studies commissioned by the USPSTF thus compared the benefits and harms of screening programs based on risk prediction models vs risk factor&ndash;based screening (ie, using age and smoking history). The risk prediction models used were modified versions of the PLCOm2012 model,<sup>33</sup> the Lung Cancer Death Risk Assessment Tool (LCDRAT) model,<sup>34</sup> and the Bach model,<sup>35</sup> limited to age, sex (for those models that include sex as a variable, such as the LCDRAT and Bach models), smoking intensity, and smoking duration (and setting other potential variables such as race, education, body mass index, personal history of cancer, or family history of lung cancer to their reference value). Because age is an important risk factor for lung cancer, these risk prediction models shifted screening to persons of older age and increased the number of lung cancer deaths averted, but screening occurs at older ages when there are fewer years to be gained. Thus, some risk prediction model&ndash;based screening programs were associated with slightly increased life-years gained, while some were not or were associated with even slightly decreased life-years gained. Risk prediction models also were associated with increased the number of over diagnosed lung cancers, which are more common in older individuals.<sup>14</sup></p>\r\n<p>It is possible that the use of a more complex risk prediction model to determine eligibility might impose a barrier to wider implementation and uptake of lung cancer screening, a service that currently has low uptake. Currently, there are no studies that have prospectively compared the use of USPSTF criteria considering age, pack-year smoking history, and number of years since quitting vs risk prediction models as criteria for lung cancer screening, so it is uncertain whether using a risk prediction model would improve lung cancer detection and clinical outcomes. The International Lung Screening Trial (ILST), a prospective cohort study that is comparing the accuracy of the PLCOm2012 model against the 2013 USPSTF criteria for detecting lung cancer, may provide some evidence regarding this issue.<sup>36</sup> In summary, determining eligibility for lung cancer screening using more complex risk prediction models may represent an implementation barrier, and there is currently insufficient evidence to assess whether risk prediction model&ndash;based screening would improve outcomes relative to simply using the risk factors of age and smoking history.</p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Screening and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>Harms of screening can include false-positive results leading to unnecessary tests and invasive procedures, overdiagnosis, radiation-induced cancer, incidental findings, and increases in distress or anxiety.</p>\r\n<p>The NLST reported false-positive rates of 26.3% for baseline, 27.2% for year 1, and 15.9% for year 2.9 The NELSON trial reported false-positive rates of 19.8% at baseline, 7.1% at year 1, 9.0% for males at year 3, and 3.9% for males at year 5.5 of screening.<sup>11,37</sup> An implementation study through the Veterans Health Administration revealed a false-positive rate of 28.9% of veterans eligible for screening (58% of those who were actually screened) at baseline.<sup>38</sup> Both of these studies were conducted prior to the use of the Lung-RADS protocol for nodule classification, the use of which may reduce false-positives, albeit at the cost of some false-negatives. One retrospective study assessed how use of Lung-RADS would have changed the false-positive result rate in the NLST and found a false-positive rate among baseline results for Lung-RADS of 12.8% (95% CI, 12.4%-13.2%) vs 26.6% (95% CI, 26.1%-27.1%) for the NLST approach.<sup>21</sup></p>\r\n<p>The further workup of false-positive results can result in significant harms such as additional imaging, biopsy, or surgical procedures. Fourteen studies reported on the evaluation of false-positive results. Among all patients screened, the percentage who had a needle biopsy for false-positive results ranged from 0.09% to 0.56%. Complication rates from needle biopsy for false-positive results ranged from 0.03% to 0.07% of all patients screened. Surgical procedures for false-positive results were reported in 0.5% to 1.3% of all screened participants.<sup>24</sup></p>\r\n<p>In the NLST, false-positive results led to invasive procedures (needle biopsy, thoracotomy, thoracoscopy, mediastinoscopy, and bronchoscopy) in 1.7% of patients screened. Complications occurred in 0.1% of patients screened, and death in the 60 days following the most invasive procedure performed to evaluate a false-positive result occurred in 0.007% of those screened.<sup>9</sup> One study estimated that the use of Lung-RADS criteria would have prevented 23.4% of invasive procedures due to false-positive results.<sup>21</sup></p>\r\n<p>In the CISNET modeling studies, the false-positive rate varied based on screening eligibility criteria. Relative to the 2013 USPSTF criteria (A-55-80-30-15), the 2021 USPSTF criteria (A-50-80-20-15) would result in 2.2 vs 1.9 false-positive results per person over a lifetime of screening.<sup>14</sup> Note that screening programs that start at younger ages or use a lower pack-year eligibility screen a larger total number of persons.</p>\r\n<p>Determining the rate of overdiagnosis in screening trials is challenging because the duration of follow-up affects the calculation of excess, potentially over diagnosed, cancers in the screening vs control groups. Initially, the NLST reported 119 additional lung cancers (1060 total cancers with LDCT vs 941 with chest radiography) after 3 screening rounds and 6.5 years of follow-up (IRR, 1.12 [95% CI, 1.02-1.22]).<sup>9,24</sup> With extended follow-up, the NLST found no statistically significant difference between groups for overall lung cancer incidence; however, this study had some methodological limitations, including use of a different ascertainment method during posttrial follow-up, lack of information on any posttrial screening that may have occurred in either the LDCT or chest radiography group, and missing data.<sup>39</sup> In the NELSON trial, 40 excess lung cancers (344 cancers in the LDCT group vs 304 in the control group) were reported in the LDCT group after the a priori planned 10 years of follow-up; after 11 years of follow-up, there was an excess of 14 cancers with LDCT.<sup>11</sup></p>\r\n<p>In the CISNET modeling studies, which account for lifetime follow-up, the 2013 USPSTF screening program (A-55-80-30-15) would result in 6.3% of screen-detected cases of lung cancer being over diagnosed lung cancers vs 6.0% lung cancers being overdiagnoses with the 2021 screening program (A-50-80-20-15).<sup>14</sup></p>\r\n<p>In the 9 publications reporting on radiation exposure associated with LDCT,<sup>24</sup> the radiation exposure associated with 1 LDCT scan ranged from 0.65 to 2.36 mSv. For context, average annual background radiation exposure in the US is 2.4 mSv. Two of the studies estimated the cumulative radiation exposure for participants undergoing screening with LDCT. Using estimated radiation exposure from screening and follow-up evaluations and estimates of the risk of radiation-induced cancer deaths, the Italian Lung Cancer Screening Trial (ITALUNG) estimated a lifetime risk of fatal cancer of 0.11 cases per 1000 persons for LDCT after the 4 screening rounds,<sup>40</sup> and the Continuing Observation of Smoking Subjects study estimated a lifetime risk of 2.6 to 8.1 major cancers per 10,000 persons screened after 10 rounds of annual screening.<sup>41</sup></p>\r\n<p>The CISNET modeling studies found that lifetime estimates of radiation-related lung cancer deaths varied by eligibility criteria for screening. Relative to the 2013 USPSTF recommendation (A-55-80-30-15), the 2021 USPSTF recommendation (A-50-80-20-15) would be associated with an estimated 38.6 vs 20.6 radiation-related lung cancer deaths per 100 000 persons in the total population aged 45 to 90 years, or 1 death caused for every 13.0 vs 18.5 lung cancer deaths avoided by screening.<sup>14</sup></p>\r\n<p>When comparing LDCT groups vs control groups for smoking cessation or abstinence outcomes, evidence does not indicate that screening leads to lower rates of smoking cessation or continued abstinence or to higher rates of relapse. Several studies suggest that, compared with no screening, individuals who receive LDCT screening do not have worse health-related quality of life, anxiety, or distress over 2 years of follow-up. However, screening participants who receive true-positive or indeterminate results may experience worse health-related quality of life, anxiety, or distress in the short-term.<sup>24</sup></p>\r\n<p>Studies reported a wide range of screening-related incidental findings that were deemed significant or required further evaluation (4.4% to 40.7%), in part because of inconsistent definitions of what constitutes an incidental finding and which findings were clinically significant.<sup>24</sup> Older age was associated with a greater likelihood of incidental findings. Common incidental findings included coronary artery calcification, aortic aneurysms, emphysema, and infectious and inflammatory processes. Other common findings were masses, nodules, or cysts of the kidney, breast, adrenal gland, liver, thyroid, pancreas, spine, and lymph nodes. Cancers involving the kidney, thyroid, or liver were ultimately diagnosed in 0.39% of NLST participants in the LDCT group during screening.<sup>42</sup></p>\r\n<p>Incidental findings led to downstream evaluation, including consultations, additional imaging, and invasive procedures with associated costs and burdens. The benefits of incidental detection of nonlung cancer conditions and the balance of benefits and harms of incidental findings on LDCT screening remain uncertain.</p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from July 7, 2020, to August 3, 2020. Most comments generally agreed with the draft recommendation, although some requested broadening the eligibility criteria for lung cancer screening and others mentioned that additional risk factors for lung cancer other than smoking exist or that lung cancer can occur in persons who never smoked. In response, the USPSTF acknowledges that there are risk factors for lung cancer other than smoking; however, current evidence does not support the incorporation of these risk factors as determinants of eligibility for lung cancer screening. The USPSTF also acknowledges that lung cancer can occur in persons who never smoked or among persons who currently smoke or formerly smoked who do not meet screening eligibility criteria. Nevertheless, smoking is the major risk factor for lung cancer, all trials of screening for lung cancer have been conducted among persons who smoke or were former smokers, and trial and modeling data support the current USPSTF recommendation as offering a reasonable balance of benefits and harms.</p>\r\n<p>Some comments suggested the use of more complex risk prediction models to determine eligibility for lung cancer screening. In response, the USPSTF clarified language that use of these risk prediction models might make implementation more difficult, and that there are currently no lung cancer screening trials prospectively comparing USPSTF eligibility criteria with risk prediction models. The USPSTF also added a reference to the ILST, a prospective cohort study addressing this issue.</p>\r\n<p>In response to comments, the USPSTF also added information about the currently low uptake of lung cancer screening and data on the effect of the current recommendation on eligibility for screening in Latinx/Hispanic persons. Last, the USPSTF added and updated resources and website links in the Additional Tools and Resources section.</p>\r\n<h3>How Does the Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?</h3>\r\n<p>Lung cancer is a proliferation of malignant cells that originate in lung tissue. Smoking is the strongest risk factor for lung cancer. Older age is also associated with increasing incidence of lung cancer. Lung cancer is classified into 2 major categories based on cell type and immunohistochemical and molecular characteristics: NSCLC, which collectively comprises adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell carcinoma, and small cell lung cancer. Screening is aimed at early detection of NSCLC rather than small cell lung cancer because the latter is much less common and typically spreads too quickly to be reliably detected at an early, potentially curable stage by screening.</p>\r\n<p>Currently, 79% of patients present with lung cancer that has spread to regional lymph nodes or metastasized to distant sites. Only 17% of patients present with localized disease. Patients with localized disease have a 59% 5-year survival rate, compared with 32% for those with regional spread and 6% for those with distant metastases.<sup>1</sup> By leading to earlier detection and treatment, screening for lung cancer can give patients a greater chance for cure.</p><h2>Research Needs and Gaps</h2><ul>\r\n<li>Implementation research addressing how best to increase the uptake of lung cancer screening discussions in clinical practice is needed, particularly among the populations at higher risk of death from lung cancer or populations that are socially and economically disadvantaged.</li>\r\n<li>Research is needed to evaluate whether, as lung cancer screening is implemented in more diverse community settings, including among racial/ethnic minorities, among populations socially and economically disadvantaged (for whom smoking prevalence and lung cancer incidence is higher), and in settings that screen greater numbers of women, the balance of benefits and harms differs from those observed in RCTs.</li>\r\n<li>Research to identify biomarkers that can accurately identify persons at high risk is needed to improve detection and minimize false-positive results.</li>\r\n<li>Research to identify technologies that can help more accurately discriminate between benign and malignant lung nodules is needed.</li>\r\n<li>Research is needed on the benefits and harms of using risk prediction models to select patients for lung cancer screening, including whether use of risk prediction models represents a barrier to wider implementation of lung cancer screening in primary care.</li>\r\n</ul><h2>Recommendations of Others</h2><p>The American Association for Thoracic Surgery recommends annual lung cancer screening with LDCT for North Americans aged 55 to 79 years with a 30 pack-year history of smoking. It also recommends offering annual lung cancer screening with LDCT starting at age 50 years to persons with a 20 pack-year smoking history if there is an additional cumulative risk of developing lung cancer of 5% or greater over the following 5 years.<sup>43</sup></p>\r\n<p>The American Cancer Society recommends annual lung cancer screening with LDCT for persons aged 55 to 74 years who are in fairly good health, have at least a 30 pack-year smoking history, and currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years. It also recommends smoking cessation counseling for current smokers, shared decision-making about lung cancer screening, and that screening be conducted in a high-volume, high-quality lung cancer screening and treatment center.<sup>44</sup></p>\r\n<p>The American College of Chest Physicians suggests that annual screening with LDCT should be offered to asymptomatic smokers and former smokers aged 55 to 77 years who have smoked 30 pack-years or more and either continue to smoke or have quit within the past 15 years. It also recommends that screening not be performed for individuals with comorbidities that adversely influence their ability to tolerate the evaluation of screen-detected findings or tolerate treatment of an early-stage screen-detected lung cancer or that substantially limit their life expectancy.<sup>45</sup></p>\r\n<p>The National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommends annual screening for lung cancer with LDCT in persons aged 55 to 77 years who have at least a 30 pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years or in persons 50 years or older who have at least a 20 pack-year smoking history and have at least 1 additional risk factor for lung cancer.<sup>46</sup></p>\r\n<p>The American Academy of Family Physicians has concluded that the evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against screening for lung cancer with LDCT in persons at high risk of lung cancer based on age and smoking history.<sup>47</sup></p>","topic":"Lung Cancer: Screening","keywords":"Lung Cancer|CT|computed tomography","pubDate":"2021-03-09","categories":["3"],"tool":["274","281","280","279","278","277","276","275"]},"433":{"topicType":"Counseling","topicYear":2020,"uspstfAlias":"drug-use-illicit-primary-care-interventions-for-children-and-adolescents","specific":[665],"title":"Illicit Drug Use in Children, Adolescents, and Young Adults: Primary Care-Based Interventions","rationale":"<h2>Importance</h2><p>In 2017, an estimated 7.9% of persons aged 12 to 17 years reported illicit drug use in the past month,<sup>1</sup> and an estimated 50% of adolescents in the US had used an illicit drug by the time they graduated from high school.<sup>2</sup> Young adults aged 18 to 25 years have a higher rate of current illicit drug use, with an estimated 23.2% currently using illicit drugs.

The purpose of this recommendation is to assess the evidence on interventions to prevent the initiation of illicit drug use and thus does not apply to persons who already have a history of regular or harmful illicit drug use. Children, adolescents, and young persons who are regular users of illicit drugs (at least once per week) or have been diagnosed with a substance use disorder are outside the scope of this recommendation.</p>\r\n<p>Screening for illicit drug use in adults and adolescents (aged 12-17 years) is covered in a separate recommendation statement.<sup>5</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Definitions of Illicit Drug Use, Including Nonmedical Drug Use</h3>\r\n<p>The term &ldquo;illicit drug use&rdquo; is defined as the use of substances (not including alcohol or tobacco products) that are illegally obtained or involve nonmedical use of prescription medications; that is, drug use for reasons, for duration, in amounts, or with frequency other than prescribed, or use by persons other than the prescribed individual. Nonmedical drug use also includes the use of over-the-counter medications, such as cough suppressants. Other illicit drugs include household products such as glues, solvents, and gasoline. These substances are ingested, inhaled, injected, or administered using other methods to affect cognition, affect, or other mental processes; to &ldquo;get high&rdquo;; or for other nonmedical reasons.</p>\r\n<h3>Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>The body of evidence to recommend specific interventions to prevent initiation of illicit drugs that can be provided or referred from the primary care setting is insufficient. Studied interventions include face-to-face or group counseling, print materials, interactive computer-based tools designed for patient use, and clinician training and quality improvement programs. Studies on these interventions provide inconsistent evidence on the net benefit to behavioral outcomes (drug abstinence or reduced frequency or quantity of illicit drug use) or health outcomes (morbidity, mortality, educational, or legal outcomes).</p>\r\n<h3>Other Related USPSTF Recommendations</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF has several recommendations on substance use&ndash;related services for young persons. The USPSTF is currently updating its recommendations on screening for illicit drug use in adults 18 years and older (B recommendation) and in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years (I statement).<sup>5</sup> The USPSTF also has recommendations on screening and behavioral counseling interventions to reduce unhealthy alcohol use in adults 18 years and older (B recommendation) and adolescents aged 12 to 17 years (I statement).<sup>6</sup> In addition, the USPSTF is currently updating its recommendations on education or brief counseling interventions to prevent initiation of tobacco use among school-aged children and adolescents (B recommendation) and interventions for the cessation of tobacco use among school-aged children and adolescents (I statement).<sup>7</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>\r\n<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>\r\n<p>Illicit drug use is associated with multiple negative health, social, and economic consequences. In 2011, the Drug Abuse Warning Network estimated that approximately 190,000 emergency department visits by persons aged 0 to 21 years involved illicit drug use (not including alcohol),<sup>8</sup> and more than 79,000 of those visits were related to nonmedical use of opioids in persons aged 12 to 25 years.<sup>9</sup> In 2015, drug overdose (both intentional and unintentional) accounted for 9.7 deaths per 100,000 persons aged 15 to 24 years.<sup>10</sup></p>\r\n<p>Frequent and heavy illicit drug use is associated with increased risk-taking behaviors while intoxicated, such as driving under the influence, unsafe sexual activity, and violence. In 2016, 73.6% of all deaths in young persons aged 10 to 24 years in the US resulted from 3 causes: unintentional injuries, including motor vehicle crashes (41.1%); suicide (17.3%); and homicide (14.9%).<sup>3</sup> Among the leading health risk behaviors, the use of alcohol and illicit drugs are the primary health risk behaviors that contribute to these causes of death.<sup>11</sup></p>\r\n<p>Illicit drug use can also have harmful long-term consequences. Children and adolescents who initiate marijuana use before age 17 years are more likely to progress to other drug use and drug abuse/dependence as adults compared with those who initiate use after age 18 years.<sup>12</sup> Studies have linked use of cannabis to poorer academic performance and lower education attainment (ie, dropping out of high school or not obtaining a college degree).<sup>13-15</sup> Persistent illicit drug use starting in adolescence has been associated with negative psychosocial and neurocognitive effects, including increased anxiety and impaired abstract thinking, attention, learning, and psychomotor functioning.<sup>16,17</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Potential Benefits&nbsp;</h4>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found inconsistent evidence on potential benefits associated with interventions. There was a small, statistically significant improvement in cannabis use specifically. However, other drug use outcomes (such as any illicit drug use and the number of times used in the last 3 months) failed to demonstrate statistically significant improvement. There was little evidence that interventions to prevent illicit drug use improve health outcomes such as mortality, educational attainment, or legal outcomes.<em>&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n<h4>Potential Harms</h4>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found limited evidence on potential harms associated with interventions. Only 1 study reported nonspecific &ldquo;adverse events,&rdquo; with no difference between intervention and control groups.<sup>18</sup> Potential harms include a paradoxical increase in illicit drug use.<sup>19,20</sup><em>&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n<h4>Current Practice</h4>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found little evidence on the frequency of use of behavioral counseling in primary care to prevent initiation of illicit drug use among nonusers or the escalation of use among persons who do not use illicit drugs regularly.</p><h2>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h2><p>This recommendation replaces the 2014 USPSTF recommendation, which was also an I statement.<sup>21</sup> This recommendation statement incorporates new evidence since 2014 and now includes young adults (aged 18-25 years).</p>","other":"<h2>Supporting Evidence</h2><h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF commissioned a systematic evidence review to evaluate the evidence on the potential benefits and harms of interventions to prevent illicit drug use in children, adolescents, and young adults.<sup>22,23</sup> This review was used to update the 2014 USPSTF recommendation statement.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF uses the term &ldquo;illicit drug use&rdquo; to reflect a spectrum of behaviors that range from abstinence to severe substance use disorder. The scope of this recommendation includes interventions designed to prevent illicit drug use in children, adolescents, and young persons who have never used illicit drugs as well as stopping illicit drug use among those with experimental or limited use. Children, adolescents, and young persons who are regular users of illicit drugs (at least once per week) or have been diagnosed with a substance use disorder are outside the scope of this recommendation. Interventions included in the review were either conducted in a primary care setting or judged to be generalizable to a primary care setting.</p>\r\n<p>Although alcohol and tobacco are both psychoactive drugs, they are not the focus of this recommendation. The USPSTF has made separate recommendations on screening and counseling for tobacco and alcohol use in adolescents.<sup>6,24</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed 29 studies (N = 18,353) of interventions to prevent illicit drug use.<sup>22,23</sup> The review included 26 general prevention trials and 3 trials of the Family Spirit program, an intensive home visitation program that targeted pregnant Native American/Alaska Native youth.<sup>18,25,26</sup> Ten of the studies targeted middle school&ndash;aged students (aged 10-14 years) and 2 targeted young adults (aged 17-24 years). The remaining studies focused on high school&ndash;aged youth or covered an age range inclusive of high school&ndash;aged youth. Most (22) of the studies were conducted in the US. Race/ethnicity data were not reported in all studies, although 10 studies included a majority of black and Hispanic youth, 3 were limited to Native American women or girls, and 1 was limited to Asian American women or girls.</p>\r\n<p>Half of the interventions (50%) were individual counseling sessions (in person or by telephone), 21% were group sessions or a combination of group and individual sessions, and 35% were primarily computer based. Trials in middle school&ndash;aged youth tended to be more intensive, with an average of 7 to 12 sessions, compared with 1 to 3 sessions in older groups. Most interventions involved the youth alone (68%) or the youth and the parent (23%). Common components of interventions targeted to youth were education about illicit drugs, other substances, or both; correction of normative thoughts or beliefs; and development of social skills, stress management skills, positive peer relationships, refusal skills, and self-esteem. Interventions targeted to parents included information on youth development, communication, monitoring, establishing rules, and positive parenting.<sup>22,23</sup></p>\r\n<p>The majority of trials addressed outcomes in addition to illicit drug use, with 9 trials focusing broadly on substance use (including alcohol, tobacco, or both). Other outcomes included family functioning (8 trials), risky sexual behavior (5 trials), mental health and emotional well-being (6 trials), truancy and delinquent behaviors (1 trial), and breastfeeding and infant care (3 trials).<sup>22,23</sup> Behavioral outcomes included illicit drug use (either any illicit drug use or frequency of use), associated alcohol and tobacco use, delinquent behavior, risky sexual behavior, and unsafe driving.</p>\r\n<p>Findings were inconsistent for illicit drug use outcomes across all studies. For the general prevention trials (ie, those other than the Family Spirit trials), the pooled effect of interventions on illicit drug use (including any drug use and number of times used) was not statistically significant (pooled standard mean difference, &ndash;0.08 [95% CI, &ndash;0.16 to 0.0001]; 24 trials; n = 12,801; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 57.0%).<sup>22</sup> The pooled odds ratio for using any illicit drug was also nonstatistically significant (0.82 [95% CI, 0.67 to 1.04]; 12 trials; n = 9031; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 38.2%); however, there was a statistically significant improvement in cannabis use specifically (pooled odds ratio, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.64 to 0.95]; 7 trials; n = 6520; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 1.3%).<sup>22,23</sup> For continuous outcomes (number of times used in the last 3 months), the pooled mean difference between groups was statistically nonsignificant (0.21 times fewer in the intervention group [95% CI, &ndash;0.44 to 0.02]; 11 trials; n = 3651; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 51.0%).<sup>22,23</sup> Only 4 trials reported on outcomes specifically related to misuse of prescription medications. All were computer-based interventions and reported greater reductions of misuse, ranging from 0.1 to 11.3 times fewer over the previous 3 months and up to 24 months of follow-up.<sup>21</sup> Although some interventions reported positive findings at 1 or more follow-ups, nearly half of the trials reported no clear benefit, and 2 trials reported statistically significant <em>increases</em> in illicit drug use for at least 1 drug use outcome in the intervention group compared with the control group.<sup>22</sup></p>\r\n<p>For the Family Spirit home visitation trials, only 1 found statistically significant reductions in illicit drug use, although only at the final time point (38-month follow-up).<sup>22,23</sup> Other behavioral outcomes, including delinquent behavior, risky sexual behavior, and unsafe driving, were not reported.<sup>22,23</sup></p>\r\n<p>Nineteen studies (n = 9042) (16 of the general prevention trials and all 3 of the Family Spirit trials) reported on health or related outcomes.<sup>18,19,25-41</sup> Mental health and family functioning were the most common type of outcomes reported, although no outcome was widely reported. Mental health outcomes were reported in 12 trials and included global mental health functioning (5 trials), depression symptoms (7 trials), externalizing (3 trials), internalizing (1 trial), and anxiety symptoms (1 trial). Most of the general prevention trials found no group-to-group differences on mental health symptom scales after 3 to 24 months, and results were mixed for the Family Spirit trials. Family functioning (family communication, parental monitoring, and maternal closeness) was reported in 5 trials. Three of these trials reported statistically significant improvements in family functioning (0.3 to 0.6 on a 5-point scale for up to 24 months), although the clinical significance of this finding is uncertain.<sup>22,23</sup> Other reported health or related outcomes, such as consequences of illicit drug use (3 trials), health-related quality of life (1 trial), and arrests (1 trial) failed to demonstrate consistent benefit. No trials reported mortality.</p>\r\n<h3>Evidence on Harms of Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>No studies directly reported harms related to interventions, although one trial reported no difference in &ldquo;adverse events&rdquo; between intervention and control groups.<sup>18</sup> Two studies reported paradoxical and statistically significant increased illicit drug use in intervention groups compared with control groups.<sup>19,20</sup> Seven other studies reported statistically nonsignificant increases in illicit drug, alcohol, or tobacco use in intervention groups.<sup>25,26,29,34,40,42,43</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this Recommendation Statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from October 1 through October 28, 2019. Several comments noted that the term &ldquo;prevent or reduce&rdquo; could be interpreted as applying only to persons who have never used illicit drugs or only to those currently using drugs. The primary focus of this recommendation is the prevention of illicit drug use in children, adolescents, and young adults who are not regular drug users (defined as drug use less than 1 time per week). This includes persons who have never used drugs as well as those with early or experimental use. Changes were made to clarify this point.</p>\r\n<p>Comments also suggested that research on interventions that can be carried out in schools should be included. These comments also noted that the term &ldquo;primary care&ndash;based&rdquo; is confusing, since many of the reviewed interventions were not carried out in a clinical setting. The USPSTF makes recommendations on interventions that can be conducted in or referred from a clinical setting. As such, only studies that are conducted in or are judged to be generalizable to a primary care setting were included in the review. Language was added to clarify this. The USPSTF wishes to emphasize that screening for drug use in adolescents and young adults is covered in a separate recommendation. As such, evidence on screening interventions was not reviewed in this recommendation. In addition, the USPSTF updated the recommendation to include data from a recent trial<sup>44</sup> that evaluated the effect of a computer-based intervention for the prevention of youth substance use and associated risky behaviors.</p><h2>Research Needs and Gaps</h2><p>The USPSTF identified several gaps in the evidence where more research is needed:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>There was promising evidence that interventions could be effective in preventing cannabis use specifically; however, the benefit to harm ratio could not be determined because of a lack of studies reporting harms. Future research on cannabis prevention that deliberately addresses both benefits and harms is needed.</li>\r\n<li>There was minimal reporting on health, social, or legal outcomes and significant heterogeneity in reporting on drug use outcomes. Standardization of outcome measurement across trials would greatly strengthen the evidence base and improve the ability to pool data.</li>\r\n<li>Several interventions such as the Familias Unidas program (a family-based intervention program focusing on Hispanic youth) and interventions that included clinician training, education, personal coaching, and continuous quality improvement components showed promise in reducing illicit drug use. More studies are needed that replicate and further refine these interventions.</li>\r\n<li>There was no evidence on preventing or reducing illicit drug use in children younger than 10 years and limited evidence in young adults (aged 18-25 years). More data are needed on the benefits and harms of interventions in these age groups.</li>\r\n<li>Technology-based interventions such as text-based messaging, smartphone apps, games, web-based interventions, and social media have the potential for wide reach, although there are limited data about their effectiveness. More studies of implementation of these types of interventions is needed, specifically among families referred from primary care, to determine their uptake and effectiveness.</li>\r\n</ul><h2>Recommendations of Others</h2><p>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration recommends that universal screening for substance use, brief intervention, and/or referral to treatment (SBIRT) be part of routine health care.<sup>45</sup> In children and adolescents, &ldquo;brief interventions&rdquo; include a wide spectrum of actions intended to prevent, delay, or reduce substance use.<sup>22</sup> The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that all adolescents be screened for alcohol and illicit drug use and that, based on the results, clinicians conduct further assessment, provide guidance and brief counseling interventions, and, if appropriate, refer for treatment.<sup>46</sup> For patients reporting no substance use, it recommends positive reinforcement. The Canadian Paediatric Society recommends screening and education for risky behaviors, including substance use.<sup>47</sup> The UK National Institute for Health Care Excellence recommends that clinicians consider providing preventive drug misuse activities and assess persons at risk of illicit drug misuse. Clinicians should consider providing skills training to young persons who are assessed as vulnerable to illicit and nonmedical drug use.<sup>48</sup></p>","topic":"Illicit Drug Use in Children, Adolescents, and Young Adults: Primary Care-Based Interventions","keywords":"Drug Use|Prescription drug","pubDate":"2020-05-26","categories":["1","8"],"tool":["282","285","284","283"]},"434":{"topicType":"Screening","topicYear":2021,"uspstfAlias":"hypertension-in-adults-screening","specific":[1921],"title":"Hypertension in Adults: Screening","rationale":"<h2>Importance</h2><p>Hypertension is a prevalent condition, affects approximately 45% of the adult US population,<sup>1</sup> and is the most commonly diagnosed condition at outpatient office visits.

Office blood pressure measurement is most commonly performed using a manual or automated sphygmomanometer.<sup>8,9</sup> Various OBPM protocols are available; however, in the studies reviewed by the USPSTF, OBPM was measured at the brachial artery (upper arm) with the patient most commonly in a seated position after 5 minutes of rest and medical personnel present during measurement.<sup>8,9</sup> Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) and home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) with validated and accurate devices should be used outside of a clinical setting to confirm a diagnosis of hypertension before starting treatment. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring involves wearing a programmed device that automatically takes frequent blood pressure measurements over the course of a day (or day and night); HBPM involves patients measuring their own blood pressure at home with an HBPM device.</p>\r\n<h3>Screening Intervals</h3>\r\n<p>Available evidence on optimal screening intervals for hypertension remains limited.<sup>8,9</sup> The USPSTF suggests annual screening for hypertension in adults 40 years or older and for adults at increased risk for hypertension (such as Black persons, persons with high-normal blood pressure, or persons who are overweight or obese). Screening less frequently (ie, every 3 to 5 years) is appropriate for adults aged 18 to 39 years not at increased risk for hypertension and with a prior normal blood pressure reading.</p>\r\n<h3>Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The benefits of treatment of hypertension in preventing important health outcomes such as stroke, heart failure, and coronary heart disease events are well documented.<sup>11</sup> Treatment can include lifestyle changes, pharmacotherapy, or both. Selection of treatment can vary depending on severity of blood pressure elevation, age, and other risk factors.</p>\r\n<h3>Implementation</h3>\r\n<p>Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring offers the most evidence-based risk information for future cardiovascular events. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring devices are small portable machines that record blood pressure noninvasively at typically 20- to 30-minute intervals over 12 to 24 hours while patients go about their normal activities or are sleeping. Home blood pressure monitoring devices are fully automated oscillometer devices that record measurements taken from the patient&rsquo;s brachial artery. Home blood pressure monitoring devices are activated by patients or caregivers and measurements are taken much less frequently than with ABPM (eg, 1 to 2 times a day or week, although the blood pressure measurements can be spread out over more time).</p>\r\n<h3>Additional Tools and Resources</h3>\r\n<p>Hypertension resources for health professionals are available through these resources:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The Surgeon General&rsquo;s Call to Action to Control Hypertension<br /><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/bloodpressure/docs/SG-CTA-HTN-Control-Report-508.pdf\">https://www.cdc.gov/bloodpressure/docs/SG-CTA-HTN-Control-Report-508.pdf</a></li>\r\n<li>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&rsquo;s Hypertension Resources for Health Professionals<br /><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/bloodpressure/educational_materials.htm\">https://www.cdc.gov/bloodpressure/educational_materials.htm</a>;</li>\r\n<li>Million Hearts Initiative<br /><a href=\"https://millionhearts.hhs.gov/\">https://millionhearts.hhs.gov/</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Information on how to measure blood pressure is available at <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/bloodpressure/measure.htm\">https://www.cdc.gov/bloodpressure/measure.htm</a>.

The USPSTF has issued an A recommendation on screening for high blood pressure in adults since 1996 (updated in 2003, reaffirmed in 2007, and then updated in 2015). In 2015, the USPSTF recommended screening for high blood pressure in adults 18 years or older and obtaining measurements outside of the clinical setting for diagnostic confirmation before starting treatment. The USPSTF found no new substantial evidence that could change its recommendation and therefore reaffirms its recommendation. The current reaffirmation clarifies that initial screening should be performed with OBPM, updates language to be more consistent with current evidence, and clarifies implementation strategies.</p><h2>Supporting Evidence</h2><h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF commissioned a systematic review to evaluate the benefits and harms of screening for hypertension in adults, the accuracy of OBPM for initial screening, and the accuracy of various confirmatory blood pressure measurement methods.<sup>8,9</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed evidence from 20 studies (n = 12,614) on the test accuracy of OBPM for initial screening for hypertension.<sup>8,9</sup> In all studies, blood pressure was measured at the brachial artery and ABPM was used as the reference standard. Studies reflected a wide range of clinical characteristics and most commonly included community-based samples; mean ages of participants ranged from 25 to 70 years, and 37.9% to 72.3% of participants were women.<sup>8,9</sup> Although reported less frequently, race/ethnicity was predominately White in those studies that did report it.<sup>8,9</sup> Meta-analyses of 15 studies (n = 11,309) showed a pooled sensitivity of 0.54 (95% CI, 0.37-0.70) and a pooled specificity of 0.90 (95% CI, 0.84-0.95) when using an OBPM threshold of 140/90 mm Hg compared with a reference 24-hour ABPM of 130/80 mm Hg or reference daytime ABPM of 135/85 mm Hg.<sup>8,9</sup></p>\r\n<p>Eighteen studies (n = 57,128) provided evidence on the accuracy of various methods to evaluate adults who initially screened positive for hypertension by OBPM.<sup>8,9</sup> Again, blood pressure was taken at the brachial artery and ABPM was used as the reference standard in all studies. The mean age of study participants was generally older (46-60 years), reflecting the preselected study populations. Zero percent to 66.7% of study participants were women. Again, few studies reported race/ethnicity of participants and those that did included predominantly White participants. Meta-analysis of 8 studies (n = 53,183) of repeat OBPM showed a pooled sensitivity of 0.80 (95% CI, 0.68-0.88) and pooled specificity of 0.55 (95% CI, 0.42-0.66) using an OBPM threshold of 140/90 mm Hg compared with a reference 24-hour ABPM of 130/80 mm Hg or reference daytime ABPM of 135/85 mm Hg. Meta-analysis of 4 studies (n = 1001) on HBPM found a pooled sensitivity of 0.84 (95% CI, 0.76-0.90) and a pooled specificity of 0.60 (95% CI, 0.48-0.71) using an HBPM threshold of 135/85 mm Hg compared with a reference 24-hour ABPM of 130/80 mm Hg or reference daytime ABPM of 135/85 mm Hg. Limited evidence is available on the accuracy of automated office-based blood pressure measurement (taking repeated measurements while the patient is alone in a quiet room).<sup>8,9</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Early Detection</h3>\r\n<p>No trials have compared the effectiveness of screening for hypertension vs no screening. However, a Canadian community-based, cluster randomized clinical trial<sup>8,9,19</sup> evaluated a multicomponent cardiovascular disease health promotion program that assessed cardiovascular disease outcomes of 140,642 community members in 39 clusters.<sup>8,9,19</sup> Community residents (targeted age of 65 years or older) were invited to pharmacy-based blood pressure screening and a cardiovascular disease risk assessment. Risk-specific educational materials were provided and results were communicated to the participant&rsquo;s clinician. At 1 year of follow-up, a 9% reduction in the number of hospital admissions for acute myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, or stroke was found; however, no difference in all-cause mortality was noted.<sup>20</sup> Although there is limited direct trial evidence on benefits of screening for hypertension on health outcomes, based on the available indirect evidence on the accuracy of screening tests for hypertension and robust foundational evidence showing that treatment of hypertension (detected in office-based settings) improves health outcomes,<sup>11</sup> the USPSTF found convincing evidence that screening for hypertension in adults provides health benefits.</p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Early Detection</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed 13 studies (n = 5150) that reported on harms of screening for hypertension.<sup>8,9</sup> Results from 5 studies (n = 1321) suggested that screening is not associated with any substantial short-term quality of life changes or adverse psychological outcomes. Evidence from 2 work-site studies (n = 502) reported mixed findings on whether absenteeism increased with screening. Seven studies (n = 3505) reported minor adverse events such as sleep disturbance, pain/discomfort, bruising, and skin irritation with ABPM. Overall, the USPSTF determined that the harms of screening for hypertension are minor.</p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from June 23 through July 20, 2020. Several comments requested clarification about specific techniques to accurately measure blood pressure and the use of validated blood pressure devices at the brachial artery. A brief description of how blood pressure was measured in studies is included in the Practice Considerations section, and language clarifying that the blood pressure measurements included in this review were taken at the brachial artery has been added. More resources for accurately measuring blood pressure are provided in the Additional Tools and Resources section. Other organizations provide information on validated devices, which is described in the Recommendations of Others section. Some comments expressed concern about the burden and barriers patients may experience trying to measure their blood pressure outside of a clinic setting. Resources to address these issues were added in the Additional Tools and Resources section. Comments regarding in-office blood pressure monitoring recommended adding annual screening during wellness visits for patients aged 18 to 40 years. Available evidence on optimal screening intervals for hypertension remains limited; however, the screening intervals described in the Practice Considerations section are based on the best available data.</p>\r\n<h3>How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?</h3>\r\n<p>There are different types of hypertension, including &ldquo;sustained&rdquo; hypertension (blood pressure measurements that are high when obtained both in a clinical office setting and outside the office, referred to as &ldquo;hypertension&rdquo; in the current recommendation), &ldquo;white coat&rdquo; hypertension (blood pressure measurements that are high when obtained in a clinical office setting but normal when obtained outside the office), and &ldquo;masked&rdquo; hypertension (blood pressure measurements that are high when obtained outside the office but normal when obtained in clinical office settings). Cardiovascular disease risk is highest among persons with sustained hypertension, followed by those with masked hypertension and then those with white coat hypertension.<sup>20-25</sup> The prevalence of white coat hypertension and masked hypertension in the US is unknown, but estimates based on data from international cohorts<sup>26</sup> are 8% and 14%, respectively.<sup>8</sup> Analyses of participants of a US-based study estimates a prevalence of 12.3% for masked hypertension.<sup>27</sup></p>\r\n<p>White coat hypertension can be detected by obtaining out-of-office blood pressure measurements (either through HBPM or ABPM) after an elevated blood pressure measurement is detected in the office. Masked hypertension is more difficult to identify and can only be detected when out-of-office blood pressure measurements are obtained. Current screening algorithms that focus on performing OBPM first, then following up with ABPM or HBPM in persons with elevated blood pressure measured with OBPM are not able to identify persons with masked hypertension. The USPSTF hypothesizes that screening strategies that use OBPM for both initial screening and confirmation, with traditional thresholds, would miss a greater number of cases of sustained hypertension and would lead to overtreatment of a greater number of cases of white coat hypertension. Follow-up ABPM or HBPM after an initial positive OBPM screening result would result in fewer cases of sustained hypertension being missed and fewer cases of white coat hypertension being overtreated. Confirmation with ABPM would result in the greatest number of cases of sustained hypertension being identified without any cases of white coat hypertension being treated (by definition, ABPM is considered the gold standard). Importantly, cases of masked hypertension would be missed with all 3 of these screening strategies, at least when using OBPM with traditional thresholds.</p>\r\n<p>Although the association of masked hypertension and white coat hypertension with increased cardiovascular risk has been well documented, it is unclear whether treatment of either of these types of hypertension improves health outcomes. The USPSTF considers this a critical evidence gap.</p><h2>Research Needs and Gaps</h2><p>The association of masked hypertension and white coat hypertension with increased cardiovascular risk has been well documented; however, more evidence is needed to understand whether early detection and treatment of these hypertension types lead to an improvement in health. More research is needed on the following.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The benefits and harms of early detection and treatment of masked hypertension and white coat hypertension:</li>\r\n<li>Does early detection of masked hypertension and white coat hypertension lead to improved health outcomes?</li>\r\n<li>Does treating masked hypertension improve cardiovascular health outcomes?</li>\r\n<li>Does treating white coat hypertension cause harms?</li>\r\n<li>The prevalence of masked hypertension and white coat hypertension in the US.</li>\r\n<li>How frequently do adults transition between the different types of hypertension, and how long is the length of time it takes to transition (eg, what percentage of persons with masked hypertension transition to sustained hypertension, and how long does that transition take)?</li>\r\n<li>Identification of feasible methods for early detection of masked hypertension.</li>\r\n<li>Inclusion of diverse and underrepresented persons in all of the above studies is needed to determine optimal screening for all types of hypertension.</li>\r\n</ul>","other":"<h2>Recommendations of Others</h2><p>The report from the panel members of the Eighth Joint National Committee did not address the diagnosis of hypertension in its 2014 guidelines.<sup>11</sup> The Seventh Joint National Committee recommended screening for high blood pressure at least once every 2 years in adults with blood pressure less than 120/80 mm Hg and every year in adults with blood pressure of 120 to 139/80 to 89 mm Hg.<sup>6</sup> The American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association recommend proper measurement methods be used for diagnosis and management of high blood pressure and that out-of-office blood pressure measurement be performed to confirm the diagnosis of hypertension.<sup>7,28</sup> They also suggest screening for masked hypertension with ABPM or HBPM in adults who consistently have systolic blood pressure measurements of 120 to 129 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure measurements of 75 to 79 mm Hg in the office<sup>7,28</sup> and screening for white coat hypertension in adults who consistently have systolic blood pressure measurements of 130 to 160 mm Hg or diastolic measurements of 80 to 100 mm Hg in the office.

Adults with other known modifiable cardiovascular risk factors such as abnormal blood glucose levels, obesity, and smoking are not included in this recommendation.<sup>5-7</sup> Interventions to reduce CVD risk in those adults are covered in other USPSTF recommendations.</p>\r\n<h3>Definitions of Healthy Diet and Physical Activity</h3>\r\n<p>The term &ldquo;healthy diet&rdquo; is defined as a balance and variety of foods and beverages that assist an individual in achieving and maintaining a healthy weight, support health, and prevent disease. Dietary counseling to promote a healthy diet focuses on increasing consumption of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fat-free or low-fat dairy, lean proteins, and oils and decreasing consumption of foods with high sodium levels, saturated or <em>trans</em> fats, and added sugars, as recommended by the US Department of Agriculture and the US Food and Drug Administration.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<p>Physical activity is broadly defined as any bodily activity that enhances or maintains overall health and physical fitness. The US Department of Health and Human Services recommends that adults 18 years or older engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity per week in addition to engaging in strengthening activities at least twice per week.<sup>1,8</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>\r\n<p>Cardiovascular risk can be characterized as the elevation of a single risk factor or multiple risk factors (eg, metabolic syndrome). Cardiovascular risk can be estimated through the use of CVD risk tools such as the Pooled Cohort Equations and Framingham Risk Score.<sup>9,10</sup> Cardiovascular disease risk factors covered in this recommendation include dyslipidemia, elevated blood pressure or hypertension, and multiple or mixed risk factors.</p>\r\n<h3>Behavioral Counseling Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>Behavioral counseling interventions usually combine counseling on a healthy diet and physical activity and are usually intensive, with multiple contacts that include either individual or group counseling sessions over extended periods. Interventions usually involve a median of 12 contacts, with an estimated 6 hours of contact time over 6 to 18 months. Interventions typically involve some 1-on-1 time with an interventionist and include motivational interviewing and behavioral change techniques such as goal setting, problem solving, and self-monitoring. Primary care clinicians as well as a wide range of specially trained professionals, including nurses, registered dietitians, nutritionists, exercise specialists, physical therapists, masters- and doctoral-level counselors trained in behavioral methods, and lifestyle coaches, can deliver these interventions.</p>\r\n<p>Common dietary counseling advice includes reductions in saturated fats, sodium, and sweets/sugars and increased consumption of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, low-sodium diet, and the Mediterranean diet are commonly recommended diets. Physical activity counseling focuses on patients achieving 90 to 180 minutes per week of moderate to vigorous activity.<sup>11</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Implementation</h3>\r\n<p>Primary care clinicians can deliver in-person behavioral counseling interventions, refer patients to behavioral counseling interventions in other settings, or inform patients about media-based interventions. For more information about risk assessment methods and behavioral counseling interventions, see the Additional Tools and Resources section and <a href=\"#tab2\">Table 2</a>.</p>\r\n<h3>Additional Tools and Resources</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The Community Preventive Services Task Force recommends several community-based interventions to promote a healthy diet (<a href=\"https://www.thecommunityguide.org/topic/nutrition\">https://www.thecommunityguide.org/topic/nutrition</a>) and physical activity (<a href=\"https://www.thecommunityguide.org/topic/physical-activity\">https://www.thecommunityguide.org/topic/physical-activity</a>), including community-wide campaigns, social support interventions, school-based interventions, and environmental and policy approaches.</li>\r\n<li>The US Department of Health and Human Services and the US Department of Agriculture have developed dietary (<a href=\"https://health.gov/our-work/food-nutrition/2015-2020-dietary-guidelines\">https://health.gov/our-work/food-nutrition/2015-2020-dietary-guidelines</a>) and physical activity (<a href=\"https://health.gov/our-work/physical-activity/current-guidelines\">https://health.gov/our-work/physical-activity/current-guidelines</a>) guidelines.

These include recommendations on behavioral counseling to promote a healthy diet and physical activity for CVD prevention in adults without cardiovascular risk factors (C recommendation);<sup>14</sup> behavioral weight loss interventions to prevent obesity-related morbidity and mortality in adults (B recommendation);<sup>6</sup> behavioral and pharmacotherapy interventions for tobacco smoking cessation in adults, including pregnant women (B recommendation);<sup>7</sup> and screening for abnormal blood glucose levels and type 2 diabetes mellitus (B recommendation).<sup>5</sup></p><h2>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h2><p>This recommendation replaces the 2014 USPSTF recommendation on behavioral counseling to promote a healthy diet and physical activity for CVD prevention in adults with cardiovascular risk factors. At that time, the USPSTF recommended intensive behavioral counseling interventions for overweight and obese adult patients with known CVD risk factors, including hypertension, dyslipidemia, impaired fasting glucose or glucose intolerance, and metabolic syndrome.<sup>15</sup> This new recommendation targets adults with known hypertension or elevated blood pressure, elevated lipid levels or dyslipidemia, and mixed or multiple risk factors (eg, metabolic syndrome or estimated 10-year CVD risk of &ge;7.5%). In contrast to the previous statement, the current recommendation does not cover adults with impaired glucose tolerance or type 2 diabetes mellitus.

The scope of this review is similar to that of the prior systematic review, except in the current review the USPSTF excluded studies limited to or predominantly conducted in persons with diabetes or prediabetes. The evidence review did not include interventions specifically focused on weight loss in general populations; however, weight loss trials that targeted adults with relevant CVD risk factors were included in this review.</p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Behavioral Counseling Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF considered 94 trials (n = 52,174) in its review.<sup>11,16</sup> Interventions that combined a healthy diet and physical activity were evaluated in 81 trial groups, diet-only interventions were evaluated in 33 trial groups, and interventions involving physical activity only were evaluated in 6 trial groups. Of the interventions reviewed, 6% were considered low-intensity, 49% medium-intensity, and 45% high-intensity. Interventions were defined as low-, medium-, or high-intensity based on the amount of interaction with a clinician (&le;30, 31-360, and &gt;360 minutes, respectively). Risk factors targeted in the interventions included abnormal lipid levels (16 trials), elevated blood pressure (32 trials), and multiple or mixed risk factors (46 trials). Most participants in the included trials were overweight or obese, with a mean body mass index of 29.8 (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) across all trials.</p>\r\n<p>Twenty-nine trials reported on patient health outcomes such as CVD events, mortality, or quality of life.<sup>11,16</sup> Twelve of these trials reported cardiovascular events, and among the trials with a composite outcome of any CVD event (eg, myocardial infarction, stroke, and incidence of peripheral artery disease), the pooled effect showed lower risk among patients receiving behavioral health counseling (pooled relative risk [RR], 0.80 [95% CI, 0.73 to 0.87]; 9 randomized controlled trials; n = 12,551; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 0%). Intervention groups also demonstrated lower event rates for both myocardial infarction (pooled RR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.70 to 1.02]; 6 trials; n = 10,375; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 0%) and stroke (pooled RR, 0.52 [95% CI, 0.25 to 1.10]; 4 trials; n = 9800; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 0%); however, results were not statistically significant for either outcome.</p>\r\n<p>Eighteen trials of medium- to high-intensity interventions reported on all-cause mortality. The pooled effect did not demonstrate a statistically significant benefit (pooled RR, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.71 to 1.11]; 18 trials; n = 17,939; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 0%), although many of these studies were not adequately powered to assess this outcome.</p>\r\n<p>A variety of self-reported quality-of-life measures were reported in 11 trials. Most findings favored the intervention group; however, group differences were generally very small and statistically nonsignificant. The USPSTF considered 91 trials (n = 47,951) that reported intermediate health outcomes.<sup>11,16</sup> Commonly reported intermediate outcomes included objective measures of blood pressure, lipid levels, weight/adiposity, glucose level, and composite cardiovascular risk score. Overall, interventions involving counseling on diet and physical activity led to statistically significant improvements in systolic blood pressure (&ndash;1.8 mm Hg [95% CI, &ndash;2.5 to &ndash;1.1]), diastolic blood pressure (&ndash;1.2 mm Hg [95% CI, &ndash;1.6 to &ndash;0.8]), total cholesterol level (&ndash;3.5 mg/dL [95% CI, &ndash;5.6 to &ndash;1.4]), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (&ndash;2.1 mg/dL [95% CI, &ndash;4.1 to &ndash;0.2]), fasting glucose level (&ndash;2.3 mg/dL [95% CI, &ndash;3.6 to &ndash;1.0]), and adiposity-related outcomes such as weight (&ndash;1.6 kg [95% CI, &ndash;2.1 to &ndash;1.1]) and body mass index (&ndash;0.5 [95% CI, &ndash;0.7 to &ndash;0.3]). For all outcomes, improvements were seen at 12 to 24 months of follow-up. The data showed no clear effect modifiers, including intervention intensity, for most outcomes, although weight loss interventions were associated with greater weight loss.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF considered 70 trials (n = 43,243) reporting outcomes related to health behaviors such as healthy eating habits and increased physical activity. There was substantial variability in the measures reported, and most outcomes were reported in fewer than 15 trials.<sup>11,16</sup> Most trials included medium- or high-intensity interventions. Overall, behavioral counseling resulted in small, statistically significant improvements in saturated fat consumption (percentage of calories from saturated fat) (pooled mean difference, &ndash;1.5% [95% CI, &ndash;1.9 to &ndash;1.1]), increased consumption of fruits and vegetables (pooled mean difference, 0.7 servings/d [95% CI, 0.1 to 1.3]), and increased fiber intake (pooled mean difference, 1.3 g/d [95% CI, 0.1 to 2.6]). Nine trials among adults with hypertension or elevated blood pressure who were counseled to reduce sodium intake showed reduced urinary sodium levels (pooled mean difference, &ndash;18.0 mmol/L [95% CI, &ndash;34.8 to &ndash;1.2]).</p>\r\n<p>Fifty trials of behavioral counseling interventions reported some type of physical activity outcome (n = 34,028); however, there was no consistent evidence of benefit. Outcome reporting was highly variable for the type of measurement reported (eg, any activity or moderate to vigorous activity) and the unit of measurement (eg, minutes per week or kJ per kg per day). The pooled effect of continuous outcomes was not statistically significant (pooled standardized mean difference, 0.06 [95% CI, &ndash;0.03 to 0.14]). However, among trials in which there was a study-defined physical activity goal (usually 90 to 180 min/wk of moderate to vigorous physical activity), intervention groups had a higher likelihood of meeting that goal (pooled RR, 1.22 [95% CI, 1.00 to 1.50]; 11 trials; n = 5887; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 91%]).</p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Behavioral Counseling Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>Of the 94 trials reviewed by the USPSTF, only 20 specifically reported on harms, and 8 of these specifically reported no adverse events.<sup>11,16</sup></p>\r\n<p>Few trials reported details about the adverse events, but most were minor. In trials evaluating physical activity interventions, a few participants reported minor musculoskeletal injuries. Serious adverse events were rare.<sup>11,16</sup> There was no consistent evidence that behavioral counseling interventions led to paradoxical changes in intermediate or behavioral outcomes.</p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comments</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this Recommendation Statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF web site from May 12, 2020, to June 8, 2020. Several comments noted that the interventions in studies were mainly provided by nonmedical professionals and requested clarification on which types of professionals could provide these services. The USPSTF recognizes that many of the studied interventions were carried out by nonphysicians and that multiple types of professionals, both medical and nonmedical, can deliver them. Language was added to clarify this point. Respondents also suggested that the recommendation highlight certain interventions such as low-carbohydrate and plant-based diets, intermittent fasting, telehealth, and wearable technologies. The USPSTF reviewed studies that included a wide range of healthy dietary advice; however, only the DASH and Mediterranean diets were examined in more than 1 study. Additionally, recommendations from plant-based and low-carbohydrate diets are included in most recommendations for a healthy diet. There were limited studies on telemedicine-based interventions and wearable technology. The USPSTF calls for more research in these areas.</p>\r\n<p>Several comments noted the disparities among patient populations in access to healthy food and requested more information on how to provide behavioral counseling services to diverse populations. The USPSTF recognizes that there are large disparities in access to resources that support a healthy diet and increased physical activity. The recommendation statement includes links to resources (eg, The Community Guide) that may help address these issues. Additionally, the USPSTF calls for more research on low-intensity approaches that work best in lower-resource settings.</p><h2>Research Needs and Gaps</h2><p>The USPSTF identified several gaps in the evidence where more research is needed.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Very few trials had sufficient sample size and follow-up to assess the effect on CVD events such as myocardial infarction or stroke and mortality. Larger studies with longer-term follow-up would be valuable to assess the effect of interventions on these outcomes.</li>\r\n<li>Reporting of behavioral outcomes was highly variable and often incomplete. Greater consistency and standardization of outcomes, specifically those for physical activity and diet, are needed to better understand the range of effects and interpret the pooled effects.</li>\r\n<li>There was little literature on the use of technologies such as wearable activity trackers. These may be useful tools to increase engagement in physical activity as well as for providing objective data on physical activity outcomes. In addition, more studies are needed that include online resources such as daily caloric intake applications or other low-intensity approaches that may be valuable in low-resource settings.</li>\r\n<li>Despite the large number of included trials reviewed by the USPSTF, there were few replication studies. Large replication studies of interventions showing reductions in CVD events are urgently needed.</li>\r\n</ul><h2>Recommendations of Others</h2><p>Numerous organizations, including the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, and the US Department of Veterans Affairs/Department of Defense have recommendations on behavioral counseling for adults with CVD risk factors.<sup>17-19</sup> Most recommend that adults adhere to a healthy diet that includes a balanced diet low in sodium and saturated fats and engage in regular physical activity. For example, the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology recommend that clinicians use counseling interventions to promote a healthy diet and physical activity (consistent with US Food and Drug Administration/Department of Health and Human Services guidelines) for all adults.<sup>17</sup> For adults with elevated blood pressure or hypertension, these organizations specifically recommend weight loss, a heart-healthy dietary pattern, sodium reduction, dietary potassium supplementation, increased physical activity with a structured exercise program, and limited alcohol consumption.</p>\r\n<p>The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American College of Endocrinology have recommendations for adults with dyslipidemia and metabolic syndrome that include 30 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity 4 to 6 times weekly with strength training 2 times weekly.<sup>20</sup> Dietary goals should include a reduced-calorie diet consisting of fruits and vegetables, grains, fish, and lean meats. The intake of saturated fats, <em>trans</em> fats, and cholesterol should be limited.<sup>20</sup> The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics recommends nutritional counseling provided by a registered dietitian nutritionist as well as regular aerobic activity to reduce blood pressure in adults with hypertension.<sup>18</sup></p>\r\n<p>The American Academy of Family Physicians refers to and affirms the 2014 USPSTF recommendation on behavioral counseling to prevent CVD.<sup>21</sup> The American College of Physicians does not currently have a clinical recommendation on behavioral counseling to promote a healthy diet or physical activity in adults.</p>","topic":"Healthy Diet and Physical Activity for Cardiovascular Disease Prevention in Adults With Cardiovascular Risk Factors: Behavioral Counseling Interventions","keywords":"Diet|Physical Activity|Exercise|Cardiovascular Disease|CVD","pubDate":"2020-11-24","categories":["5","1"],"tool":["295","304","303","302","301","300","299","298","297","296"]},"436":{"topicType":"Screening","topicYear":2020,"uspstfAlias":"blood-pressure-in-children-and-adolescents-hypertension-screening","specific":[1825],"title":"High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents: Screening","rationale":"<h2>Importance</h2><p>The prevalence of hypertension (both primary and secondary) in children and adolescents in the US ranges from 3% to 4% in most studies.<sup>1-5</sup> Primary hypertension in children and adolescents occurs primarily in children older than 13 years and has no known cause but is associated with several risk factors, including family history and higher body mass index.<sup>1</sup> Secondary hypertension occurs primarily in younger children and is most commonly caused by genetic disorders, renal disease, endocrine disorders, or cardiovascular abnormalities.<sup>1,6</sup></p><h2>USPSTF Assessment of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h2><p>The USPSTF concludes that the evidence to support screening for high blood pressure in children and adolescents aged 3 to 18 years is insufficient and that the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined.</p>\r\n<p>See the <a href=\"#tab\">Table</a> for more information on the USPSTF recommendation rationale and assessment.

Secondary hypertension in children is most commonly caused by renal or renovascular disease. Other causes of secondary hypertension include congenital cardiovascular abnormalities, genetic disorders, and endocrine disorders.<sup>1,6</sup></p>\r\n<p>The American Academy of Pediatrics revised its definitions of abnormal blood pressure in children and adolescents in 2017.<sup>8</sup> Hypertension is defined as sustained high blood pressure. Elevated blood pressure (previously known as prehypertension) in children aged 1 to 13 years is defined as 3 auscultatory blood pressure measurements between the 90th and 94th percentile based on age, height, and sex, or 120 to 129/&lt;80 mm Hg.<sup>8</sup> For children aged 1 to 13 years, hypertension is defined as 3 auscultatory blood pressure measurements at 3 different visits that are either equal to or above the 95th percentile based on age, height, and sex or above 130/80 mm Hg, whichever measurement is lower.<sup>1,8</sup> The thresholds for adolescents 13 years or older follow the adult guidelines from the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology, regardless of sex and height: stage 1 hypertension is defined as a blood pressure measurement of 130/80 to 139/89 mm Hg, and stage 2 hypertension is defined as a blood pressure measurement above 140/90 mm Hg.<sup>1,9</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>Best practice is to measure blood pressure by auscultation of the upper right arm with an appropriately sized cuff<sup>1,8</sup> at 3 different visits. (The right arm is preferred in children because standardized blood pressure tables reflect right arm readings and because low readings in the left arm could be a result of coarctation of the aorta.) Some organizations suggest that, as in adults, the diagnosis should be confirmed by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). ABPM uses portable devices that record blood pressure measurements at regular intervals (usually every 20 to 30 minutes) over 12 to 24 hours.<sup>8</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Screening Intervals</h3>\r\n<p>There is no good evidence about how often blood pressure should be measured in children and adolescents.</p>\r\n<h3>Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>Hypertension in children is often treated with lifestyle and pharmacologic interventions. Lifestyle interventions for hypertension include weight loss in children who are overweight or obese, increased physical activity, and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, as well as education and counseling. Medication is generally used to treat hypertension that is unresponsive to lifestyle modification or that has a secondary cause.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>\r\n<p>In deciding whether to screen for high blood pressure in children and adolescents, clinicians should consider the following.</p>\r\n<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>\r\n<p>Important risk factors for primary hypertension in children and adolescents are higher body mass index and a family history of hypertension. Other risk factors include low birth weight, male sex, and African American or Hispanic/Latino race/ethnicity. The increasing prevalence of hypertension in children and adolescents, possibly driven by childhood obesity, suggests that identification and treatment of hypertension may become a significant health care issue. The goal of identifying and treating children and adolescents with primary hypertension can be viewed within a larger framework of adult cardiovascular risk reduction, which includes addressing other biometric risk factors such as higher body mass index and lipid profiles and hyperglycemia. However, the variables for cardiovascular risk reduction in children are less understood than in adults.</p>\r\n<p>Extending the adult framework for cardiovascular risk reduction to children and adolescents is limited by several methodological challenges that complicate the determination of the potential preventable burden. There is limited evidence about the clinical and epidemiologic significance of percentile thresholds used in children in terms of their association with adult cardiovascular disease. In addition, the performance characteristics of current methods for diagnosing hypertension during childhood are limited and of concern because of possible high false-positive rates (ie, elevated blood pressure measurements that later normalize).</p>\r\n<p>One justification that has been suggested for screening is to identify secondary hypertension, a relatively rare condition. Younger children (younger than 6 years) are more likely than older children and adolescents to have a secondary cause of hypertension, such as renal disease, coarctation of the aorta, or endocrine disease. Secondary hypertension is unlikely to be the only clinical manifestation of the underlying disorder in these cases, and management is primarily targeted at treating the underlying condition, as well as controlling hypertension.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Potential Harms</h4>\r\n<p>Clinic-based screening for high blood pressure could result in false-positive results. Thus, unnecessary secondary evaluations or treatments may be common, particularly with frequent blood pressure screening. Pharmacologic interventions have been shown to be well tolerated, but this has only been evaluated in studies over relatively short periods.<sup>1</sup> Treatment of hypertension in childhood and adolescence with pharmacologic agents is done for a much longer period, and therefore, adverse effects may be more likely to occur.</p>\r\n<h4>Current Practice</h4>\r\n<p>Current practice for blood pressure screening typically involves measurement in office-based health care settings as part of well child or sports participation examinations, often in conjunction with other vital signs and growth parameters. Several organizations recommend routine measurement of blood pressure at well child visits starting at age 3 years, based on consensus.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Other Related USPSTF Recommendations</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF recommends that clinicians screen for obesity in children 6 years or older and offer or refer them to a comprehensive, intensive behavioral intervention to improve weight status (B recommendation).<sup>10</sup> The USPSTF found insufficient evidence on screening for lipid disorders in children and adolescents 20 years or younger (I statement).<sup>11</sup> These recommendations are available on the USPSTF website (<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org\">https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>).</p><h2>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h2><p>This recommendation updates the 2013 recommendation on screening for high blood pressure in children and adolescents.<sup>12</sup> This draft is similar to the 2013 recommendation in that the evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms is still insufficient because no direct evidence is available on screening for hypertension in children and adolescents and health outcomes, and limited evidence exists for assessing the harms of screening and treatment.<sup>12</sup></p>","other":"<h2>Supporting Evidence</h2><h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF commissioned a systematic evidence review to update its 2013 recommendation on screening for high blood pressure in children and adolescents.<sup>1,13</sup> The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on the benefits of screening, test accuracy, the effectiveness and harms of treatment, and the association between hypertension and markers of cardiovascular disease in childhood and adulthood. The scope of this review is similar to that of the prior systematic review except that in the current review, the USPSTF also examined the evidence on secondary hypertension.</p>\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>One fair-quality, US-based study (n = 247) of participants aged 11 to 19 years assessed the sensitivity of 2 office-based blood pressure measurements (1 to 2 weeks apart) compared with ABPM (the reference standard). Systolic blood pressure (SBP) at the 90th percentile was used as a threshold for elevated blood pressure. The sensitivity of office-based blood pressure measurements was 81.6%, with a specificity of 70.3% (confidence intervals not reported), compared with ABPM.<sup>1,14</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Association With Adult Hypertension and Other Intermediate Outcomes</h3>\r\n<p>Twenty observational studies evaluated the association between high blood pressure in childhood and hypertension or other intermediate outcomes in adulthood. Study sites included the US, Eastern Europe, Finland, New Zealand, and Australia. The mean duration of follow-up was 10 to&nbsp;33 years.<sup>1</sup> The studies used different thresholds for defining elevated blood pressure and hypertension in children and different definitions of hypertension in adults. However, despite differing thresholds, studies were generally consistent in demonstrating an association between elevated blood pressure in childhood and elevated blood pressure in adulthood.</p>\r\n<p>Various measures of association were reported across studies. Reported odds ratios (ORs) ranged from 1.1 to 4.5, risk ratios ranged from 1.45 to 3.60, and hazard ratios (HRs) ranged from 2.8 to 3.2.<sup>1</sup> Predictive accuracy measures such as sensitivity and positive predictive value varied, with sensitivity ranging from 0.0 to 0.89 and positive predictive values ranging from 0.05 to 0.97.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<p>Seven studies looked at the association between elevated blood pressure in childhood and other intermediate outcomes. Studies reported associations between abnormal blood pressure in childhood and carotid intima-media thickness in adulthood, with an OR of 1.24 (95% CI, 1.13 to 1.37) (mean duration of follow-up, 25 years); HRs ranged from 2.03 to 3.07 (duration of follow-up, 10 to 21 years), and correlation coefficients ranged from 0.04 to 0.16 (duration of follow-up, 21 to 31 years).<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<p>Two studies reported significant associations between elevated blood pressure in childhood and left ventricular hypertrophy in adulthood (ORs ranged from 1.30 to 1.59; HRs ranged from 1.92 to 3.41).<sup>1,15,16</sup> Single studies demonstrated significant associations between elevated childhood blood pressure and subclinical cardiovascular disease, higher aorta-femoral pulse wave velocity, and microalbuminuria.<sup>1,15,17</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>No studies directly assessed screening for high blood pressure in children and adolescents and reported effectiveness in delaying the onset of or reducing the risk for adverse cardiovascular health outcomes related to hypertension, either in childhood or adulthood. No studies addressed screening for secondary hypertension in asymptomatic children.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<p>Twenty randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and a meta-analysis<sup>1,18</sup> examined treatment of high blood pressure.</p>\r\n<p>Thirteen fair-quality placebo-controlled RCTs and 1 meta-analysis evaluated the efficacy of various pharmacologic treatments on lowering blood pressure.<sup>1,18</sup> Most of the studies excluded children or adolescents with known secondary hypertension or severe hypertension. Trial duration was limited to 2 to 4 weeks. All studies reported greater reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements in participants who received pharmacologic treatments compared with placebo. Not all differences reached statistical significance. Levels of &beta;-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists did not achieve significant reductions over 2 to 4 weeks. Pooled reductions of SBP were &ndash;4.38 mm Hg (95% CI, &ndash;7.27 to &ndash;2.16 mm Hg) for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, &mdash;3.07 mm Hg (95% CI, &ndash;4.99 to &ndash;1.44 mm Hg) for angiotensin receptor blockers, &ndash;3.20 mm Hg (95% CI,&nbsp; &ndash;8.69 to 2.23 mm Hg) for &beta;-blockers, &ndash;3.10 mm Hg (95% CI, &ndash;6.52 to 0.45 mm Hg) for calcium channel blockers, and &ndash;0.12 mm Hg (95% CI, &ndash;3.69 to 3.46 mm Hg) for mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<p>SBP was significantly reduced by physical exercise in 2 fair-quality RCTs over 3 months (&ndash;8.3 mm Hg; <em>P</em> &lt; .05; 1 RCT; n = 40) and 8 months (&ndash;4.9 mm Hg; <em>P</em> &le; .05; 1 RCT; n = 69).<sup>1,19,20</sup> A DASH-type diet (high in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy foods) resulted in statistically significant reductions in SBP (&ndash;2.2 mm Hg) and diastolic blood pressure (&ndash;2.8 mm Hg) in a completers-only analysis of 1 fair-quality RCT over 3 months (&ndash;2.2 mm Hg; <em>P</em> &lt; .01; 1 RCT; n = 57). However, the effect did not last beyond the intervention period.<sup>1,21</sup> One fair-quality RCT using a combination of a pharmacologic treatment (low-dose propranolol/chlorthalidone) and lifestyle interventions (dietary and exercise modifications for children and parents) over 6 months reported a statistically significant reduction of SBP (&ndash;7.6 mm Hg) and diastolic blood pressure (&ndash;6.9 mm Hg).<sup>1,22,23</sup> Low-salt diet and progressive muscle relaxation did not achieve reductions of blood pressure.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF did not identify studies that reported on the effectiveness of treatment of primary childhood hypertension and the reduction of blood pressure or other intermediate or health outcomes in adulthood.</p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Screening and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF did not identify studies that examined the harms of screening. Six fair-quality RCTs reported similar risks of adverse events between pharmacologic treatments and placebo.<sup>1</sup> Trial duration was only 2 to 4 weeks. One fair-quality RCT reported similar risks for adverse events between a group receiving a combination of pharmacotherapy and lifestyle interventions and a control group without treatment over 6 months.<sup>1</sup> Although these 6 studies reported few harms after short-term pharmacological treatment, there were no long-term treatment studies that reported on harms. Most treatment studies excluded children with secondary hypertension.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Primary Hypertension and Health Outcomes</h3>\r\n<p>The proportion of children with primary hypertension who revert to normal blood pressure over time, without any intervention, and the proportion of those who will continue to have hypertension in adulthood is unknown. Persistent elevation of blood pressure in adults is an established risk factor for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disorders and renal impairment. However, these conditions are often distant future events for children and adolescents. Children with primary hypertension are at higher risk of developing intermediate outcomes such as increased left ventricular mass and carotid intima-media thickness.<sup>1,5</sup> As a result, intermediate measures of target end-organ injury, including physical alterations to the structure of vascular walls (early atherosclerosis or thickening of arteries) and the heart (increased left ventricle mass) and altered renal function (microalbuminuria), are often studied. At present, the evidence about the relationship between high blood pressure or intermediate outcomes in children and the presence of hypertension and intermediate outcomes in adults is inconsistent.</p>\r\n<p>Screening for high blood pressure in younger children may lead to the diagnosis of secondary hypertension and its underlying etiologies that are responsive to treatment. However, no evidence exists that demonstrates whether screening for high blood pressure is effective in identifying asymptomatic children with secondary hypertension. In addition, treatment studies exclude children with secondary hypertension.</p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from April 21 to May 18, 2020. Comments requested clarification about secondary hypertension. In response, the USPSTF added clarifying language to the Supporting Evidence and the How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding? sections. Comments seeking additional language on harms were also received. The USPSTF provided more details in the Supporting Evidence and the Research Needs and Gaps sections. A respondent commented on the lack of attention to health inequities.

A large body of evidence demonstrates strong associations between prevalence of diabetes and social factors such as socioeconomic status, food environment, and physical environment.<sup>10</sup> The higher prevalence of diabetes in Asian persons may be related to differences in body composition. A difference in body fat composition in Asian persons results in underestimation of risk based on BMI thresholds used to define overweight in the US.<sup>11</sup></p>\r\n<p>Clinicians should consider screening at an earlier age in persons from groups with disproportionately high incidence and prevalence (American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian American, Black, Hispanic/Latino, or Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander persons) or in persons who have a family history of diabetes, a history of gestational diabetes, or a history of polycystic ovarian syndrome, and at a lower BMI in Asian American persons.<sup>11,12</sup> Data suggest that a BMI of 23 or greater may be an appropriate cut point in Asian American persons.<sup>13</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>Prediabetes and type 2 diabetes can be detected by measuring fasting plasma glucose or HbA<sub>1c</sub> level, or with an oral glucose tolerance test. A fasting plasma glucose level of 126 mg/dL (6.99 mmol/L) or greater, an HbA<sub>1c</sub> level of 6.5% or greater, or a 2-hour postload glucose level of 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) or greater are consistent with the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. A fasting plasma glucose level of 100 to 125 mg/dL (5.55-6.94 mmol/L), an HbA<sub>1c</sub> level of 5.7% to 6.4%, or a 2-hour postload glucose level of 140 to 199 mg/dL (7.77-11.04 mmol/L) are consistent with prediabetes.<sup>14</sup></p>\r\n<p>HbA<sub>1c</sub> is a measure of long-term blood glucose concentration and is not affected by acute changes in glucose levels caused by stress or illness. Because HbA<sub>1c</sub> measurements do not require fasting, they are more convenient than using a fasting plasma glucose level or an oral glucose tolerance test. Both fasting plasma glucose and HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels are simpler to measure than performing an oral glucose tolerance test. The oral glucose tolerance test is done in the morning in a fasting state; blood glucose concentration is measured 2 hours after ingestion of a 75-g oral glucose load. The diagnosis of type 2 diabetes should be confirmed with repeat testing.<sup>14</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Screening Intervals</h3>\r\n<p>Evidence on the optimal screening interval for adults with an initial normal glucose test result is limited. Cohort and modeling studies suggest that screening every 3 years may be a reasonable approach for adults with normal blood glucose levels.<sup>15-17</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Preventive Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>Both lifestyle interventions that focus on diet, physical activity, or both and metformin have demonstrated efficacy in preventing or delaying progression to diabetes in persons with prediabetes.<sup>2</sup> However, metformin has not been approved for this specific indication by the US Food and Drug Administration.</p>\r\n<p>Clinicians and patients may want to consider several other factors as they discuss preventive interventions for prediabetes. In the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) study (which serves as a model for many lifestyle intervention programs in the US), lifestyle intervention was more effective than metformin in preventing or delaying diabetes. In addition to preventing progression to diabetes, lifestyle interventions have a beneficial effect on weight, blood pressure, and lipid levels (increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and lowering triglyceride levels). Metformin has a beneficial effect on weight, but it does not appear to affect blood pressure, or to consistently improve lipid levels.<sup>2</sup> In post hoc analyses of the DPP, lifestyle intervention was effective in all subgroups, while similar analyses of the DPP and the DPP Outcomes Study (DPPOS) suggest that metformin was effective in persons younger than 60 years, in persons with a BMI of 35 or greater, in persons with a fasting plasma glucose level of 110 mg/dL (6.11 mmol/L) or greater, or in persons with a history of gestational diabetes.<sup>18,19</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Additional Tools and Resources</h3>\r\n<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has several resources related to the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes available at <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/index.html\">https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/index.html</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/prevent-type-2/index.html\">https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/prevent-type-2/index.html</a>, as well as information on the National Diabetes Prevention Program at <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/prevention/index.html\">https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/prevention/index.html</a>.</p>\r\n<p>The National Institutes of Health has several resources related to screening, diagnosis, prevention, and management of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes available at <a href=\"https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/professionals/clinical-tools-patient-management/diabetes\">https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/professionals/clinical-tools-patient-management/diabetes</a>.</p>\r\n<p>The Community Preventive Services Task Force recommends diet and physical activity promotion programs to prevent type 2 diabetes among persons at increased risk (<a href=\"https://www.thecommunityguide.org/findings/diabetes-combined-diet-and-physical-activity-promotion-programs-prevent-type-2-diabetes\">https://www.thecommunityguide.org/findings/diabetes-combined-diet-and-physical-activity-promotion-programs-prevent-type-2-diabetes</a><u>)</u>.</p>\r\n<h3>Other Related USPSTF Recommendations</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF recommends offering or referring adults with a BMI of 30 or greater to intensive, multicomponent behavioral interventions.<sup>20</sup></p><h2>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h2><p>This recommendation replaces the 2015 USPSTF recommendation statement on screening for abnormal blood glucose levels and type 2 diabetes in asymptomatic adults. In 2015, the USPSTF recommended screening for abnormal blood glucose levels as part of cardiovascular risk assessment in adults aged 40 to 70 years who have overweight or obesity. The USPSTF also recommended that clinicians should offer or refer patients with abnormal blood glucose levels to intensive behavioral counseling interventions to promote a healthful diet and physical activity.<sup>21</sup> For the current recommendation statement, the USPSTF recommends screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes in adults aged 35 to 70 years who have overweight or obesity, and that clinicians should offer or refer patients with prediabetes to effective preventive interventions. Based on data suggesting that the incidence of diabetes increases at age 35 years compared with younger ages<sup>22</sup> and on the evidence for the benefits of interventions for newly diagnosed diabetes (discussed below), the USPSTF has decreased the age at which to begin screening to 35 years.</p>","other":"<h2>Supporting Evidence</h2><h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n<p>To update its 2015 recommendation statement, the USPSTF commissioned a systematic review<sup>2,23</sup> of the evidence on screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes in asymptomatic, nonpregnant adults and preventive interventions for those with prediabetes. This review focused on direct evidence on the benefits and harms of screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes and the benefits and harms of interventions (such as behavioral counseling focused on diet, physical activity, or both, or pharmacotherapy for glycemic, blood pressure, or lipid control, compared with no treatment or usual care) for screen-detected prediabetes and type 2 diabetes or recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes. The review also looked at the evidence on the effectiveness of interventions for prediabetes to delay or prevent progression to type 2 diabetes.</p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<h4>Screening for Diabetes</h4>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found 2 randomized clinical trials, the Anglo-Danish-Dutch Study of Intensive Treatment In People with Screen Detected Diabetes in Primary Care (ADDITION)&ndash;Cambridge (n = 20,184 participants)<sup>24-26</sup> and the Ely study (n = 4936 participants),<sup>27-29</sup> that evaluated the effect of screening for diabetes on health outcomes. ADDITION-Cambridge was a cluster randomized trial that randomly assigned practices to no screening, screening followed by intensive treatment of screen-detected diabetes (HbA<sub>1c</sub> target &lt;7.0%, blood pressure target &le;135/85 mm Hg, and cholesterol targets, and low-dose aspirin use unless contraindicated), or screening followed by routine care of screen-detected diabetes. In the Ely study, the treatment of persons with screen-detected diabetes was managed by primary care clinicians as they deemed appropriate. Neither trial found a reduction in all-cause or type-specific mortality with screening compared with no screening over approximately 10 years of follow-up, which notably may have been too short to detect an effect on health outcomes. Neither trial found statistically significant differences in cardiovascular events, quality of life, nephropathy, or neuropathy between screening and control groups, but data collection for these outcomes was limited to a minority of trial participants.</p>\r\n<h4>Effect of Interventions for Screen-Detected Type 2 Diabetes or Prediabetes on Health Outcomes</h4>\r\n<p>One randomized clinical trial (ADDITION-Europe)<sup>30-33</sup> evaluated interventions for persons with screen-detected type 2 diabetes. It found no difference over 5 to 10 years of follow-up between an intensive multifactorial intervention aimed at controlling glucose, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels and routine care in the risk of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular-related mortality, occurrence of a first cardiovascular event, chronic kidney disease, visual impairment, or neuropathy. Follow-up may have been too short in this trial to detect an effect on the health outcomes of interest.</p>\r\n<p>Thirty-eight trials that assessed behavioral or pharmacologic interventions for prediabetes reported on health outcomes.<sup>2,23</sup> Overall, trials found no statistically significant differences in all-cause mortality or CVD events, and no difference or only small improvements in quality of life scores that are not likely clinically significant. Follow-up duration in most of these trials may have been too short to detect an effect on health outcomes. One trial, the Da Qing Diabetes Prevention Study comparing a 6-year lifestyle intervention (diet, exercise, or both) with control, found lower all-cause mortality and CVD-related mortality in the combined intervention groups vs control group at 23 and 30 years of follow-up, though not at 20 years of follow-up (all-cause mortality: 28.1% vs 38.4%; hazard ratio [HR], 0.71 [95% CI, 0.51 to 0.99] at 23 years and 45.7% vs 56.3%; HR, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.61 to 0.89] at 30 years; CVD-related mortality: 11.9% vs 19.6%; HR, 0.59 [95% CI, 0.36 to 0.96] at 23 years and 29.6% vs 22.0%; HR, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.48 to 0.94] at 30 years).<sup>34,35</sup> However, this trial was limited by baseline differences between intervention and control groups that were likely to bias results in favor of the intervention.</p>\r\n<h4>Effect of Interventions for Newly or Recently Diagnosed Type 2 Diabetes on Health Outcomes</h4>\r\n<p>The UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) and 2 other studies reported the effect of interventions for newly diagnosed diabetes on health outcomes. The UKPDS found that all-cause mortality, diabetes-related mortality, and myocardial infarction were improved with intensive glucose control with sulfonylureas or insulin over 20 years (10-year posttrial assessment) but not at shorter follow-up. Intensive glucose control was associated with a decreased risk for all-cause mortality (relative risk [RR], 0.87 [95% CI, 0.79 to 0.96]), diabetes-related mortality (RR, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.73 to 0.96]), and myocardial infarction (RR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.74 to 0.97]) over 20 years.<sup>36,37</sup> For persons who had overweight, intensive glucose control with metformin decreased all-cause mortality (RR, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.45 to 0.91]), diabetes-related mortality (RR, 0.58 [95% CI, 0.37 to 0.91]), and myocardial infarction (RR, 0.61 [95% CI, 0.41 to 0.89]) at the 10-year follow-up, and benefits were maintained during the subsequent 10 years of posttrial follow-up.<sup>37,38</sup></p>\r\n<p>The other 2 studies found no statistically significant difference between intervention and control groups in all-cause mortality and risk of myocardial infarction; however, these studies were limited by short duration of follow-up, small study size, or both. The Diabetes Education and Self Management for Ongoing and Newly Diagnosed (DESMOND) trial<sup>39,40</sup> found no statistically significant difference in all-cause mortality between persons randomly assigned to group education and those randomly assigned to the control group over 1 and 3 years of follow-up. Another trial (n = 150)<sup>41</sup> found no statistically significant difference in myocardial infarction over 7 years of follow-up.</p>\r\n<h4>Effect of Interventions for Prediabetes on Progression to Diabetes</h4>\r\n<p>Twenty-three trials compared lifestyle interventions with a control group for delaying or preventing the onset of type 2 diabetes.<sup>2,23</sup> In most trials (18 trials), the lifestyle interventions focused on both diet/nutrition and physical activity, and most (18 trials) delivered high-contact lifestyle interventions, defined as intervention contact time of more than 360 minutes. Most of the trials focused on persons with impaired glucose tolerance. Meta-analysis of the 23 trials found that lifestyle interventions were associated with a reduction in progression to diabetes (pooled RR, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.69 to 0.88]; n = 12,915 participants). In post hoc analyses, the DPP reported that lifestyle intervention was effective in all subgroups and treatment effects did not differ by age, sex, race and ethnicity, or BMI after 3 years of follow-up.<sup>18</sup></p>\r\n<p>Several trials also reported the effects of lifestyle interventions on intermediate outcomes. In pooled analyses, lifestyle interventions were associated with a reduction in weight (pooled weighted mean difference [WMD], &minus;1.2 kg [95% CI, &minus;1.6 to &minus;0.7 kg]) and BMI (pooled WMD, &minus;0.54 [95% CI, &minus;0.76 to &minus;0.33]). In addition, lifestyle interventions were associated with a reduction in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure (pooled WMD, &minus;1.7 mm Hg [95% CI, &minus;2.6 to &minus;0.8 mm Hg] and pooled WMD, &minus;1.2 mm Hg [95% CI, &minus;2.0 to &minus;0.4 mm Hg], respectively), and high-contact lifestyle interventions were associated with reduced triglyceride levels and increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels.<sup>2,23</sup></p>\r\n<p>Fifteen trials evaluated pharmacologic interventions to delay or prevent diabetes.<sup>2,23</sup> For metformin, meta-analysis of 3 trials found that it was associated with a reduction in the incidence of diabetes (pooled RR, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.64 to 0.83]).<sup>2,23</sup> In post hoc analyses, the DPP reported that the effect associated with use of metformin compared with placebo was not statistically significantly different after 3 years of follow-up for subgroups defined by age, sex, or race and ethnicity. The analysis reported a statistically significant effect modification by BMI, with greater effect on diabetes incidence for persons with a higher BMI (eg, reduction in diabetes incidence, 53% [95% CI, 36% to 65%] for BMI &ge;35 vs 3% [95% CI, &minus;36% to 30%] for BMI of 22 to &lt;30).<sup>18</sup> For both thiazolidinediones and &alpha;-glucosidase inhibitors, meta-analysis of 3 trials each found associations with a reduction in the incidence of diabetes, but the results were limited by imprecision and inconsistency across trials.<sup>2,23</sup> Other pharmacologic interventions seeking to delay or prevent diabetes have been studied, but only in 1 study each.<sup>2</sup></p>\r\n<p>Two trials reported the effects of metformin on intermediate outcomes. The DPP (n = 2155) reported greater decreases in weight for persons receiving metformin compared with those receiving placebo (&minus;2.0 kg [95% CI, &minus;3.2 to &minus;0.8 kg]).<sup>18</sup> The Promotora Effectiveness Versus Metformin Trial (PREVENT-DM) of metformin also found that participants in the intervention group had greater decreases in weight and BMI, but the differences were not statistically significant.<sup>42</sup> Both trials reported no significant difference in blood pressure among persons receiving metformin compared with placebo.<sup>42,43</sup> The DPP reported a greater increase in high-density lipoprotein levels for persons receiving metformin compared with those receiving placebo after 3 years (difference between groups, 0.40 [95% CI, 0.15 to 0.65]) but no difference between groups for other lipid levels,<sup>43</sup> whereas the PREVENT-DM study (n = 92) found no statistically significant difference in lipid levels between metformin and control groups at 1 year.<sup>42</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Screening and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>Some of the trials reporting on the benefits of screening and interventions for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes also reported harms. Overall, the ADDITION-Cambridge and Ely trials, and a pilot study of ADDITION-Cambridge,<sup>28,29,44-46</sup> did not find clinically significant differences between screening and control groups in measures of anxiety, depression, worry, or self-reported health. However, the results suggest possible short-term increases in anxiety (at 6 weeks) among persons screened and diagnosed with diabetes compared with those screened and not diagnosed with diabetes.</p>\r\n<p>Harms of interventions for screen-detected or recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes were sparsely reported and, when reported, were rare and not significantly different between intervention and control groups across trials.<sup>2,23</sup> The UKPDS trial reported 1 patient of 911 in the intervention group receiving insulin who died from hypoglycemia, and serious hypoglycemic events requiring medical attention in 6 of 619 participants (1%) receiving chlorpropamide, 9 of 615 (1.5%) receiving glibenclamide, 16 of 911 (1.8%) receiving insulin, and 6 of 896 (0.7%) in the conventional care group.<sup>36</sup></p>\r\n<p>Several trials reported on harms associated with interventions for prediabetes. Four studies of pharmacotherapy interventions reported on any hypoglycemia and found no difference between interventions and placebo over 8 weeks to 5 years. Three trials found higher rates of gastrointestinal adverse events associated with metformin. Although not reported in studies, lactic acidosis is a rare but potentially serious adverse effect of metformin, primarily in persons with significant renal impairment.<sup>47</sup> In studies of lifestyle interventions that reported on musculoskeletal events, 1 study found no significant difference between groups for rates of joint sprains/strains or muscle or joint aches over 1 year, 1 study found few cases of musculoskeletal problems (&lt;1% per group), and 1 study (the DPP) found higher rates of musculoskeletal symptoms per 100 person-years in the intensive lifestyle intervention group than in the control group (24.1 vs 21.1 events per 100 person-years; <em>P</em> &lt; .017).<sup>2,23</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from March 16 to April 12, 2021. Many comments agreed with the USPSTF recommendation. In response to public comment, the USPSTF clarified that disparities in the prevalence of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes are due to social factors and not biological ones, and incorporated person-first language when referring to persons who have overweight or obesity. Some comments requested broadening the eligibility criteria for screening to all adults, or to persons with any risk factor for diabetes, and not confined to persons who have overweight or obesity. The USPSTF appreciates these perspectives; however, the available evidence best supports screening starting at age 35 years. The USPSTF also added language clarifying that overweight and obesity are the strongest risk factors for developing prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. In response to comments, the USPSTF also noted that metformin appears to be effective in reducing the risk of progression from prediabetes to diabetes in persons with a history of gestational diabetes, based on post hoc analyses of the DPP and DPPOS.</p><h2>Research Needs and Gaps</h2><p>More research is needed to evaluate the following.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>More studies are needed on the effects of screening on health outcomes that enroll populations reflective of the prevalence of diabetes in the US, particularly racial and ethnic groups that have a higher prevalence of diabetes than White persons.</li>\r\n<li>More US data are needed on the effects of lifestyle interventions and medical treatments for screen-detected prediabetes and diabetes on health outcomes over a longer follow-up period, particularly in populations reflective of the prevalence of diabetes.</li>\r\n<li>More research is needed on how best to increase uptake of lifestyle interventions, especially among populations at highest risk for progression to diabetes and adverse health outcomes.</li>\r\n<li>Clinical trials and additional modeling studies are needed to better elucidate the optimal frequency of screening and the age at which to start and stop screening.</li>\r\n<li>More research is needed on the natural history of prediabetes, including the identification of factors associated with risk of progression to diabetes or reversion to normoglycemia.</li>\r\n</ul><h2>Recommendations of Others</h2><p>The American Diabetes Association<sup>48</sup> recommends universal screening for prediabetes and diabetes, using a fasting plasma glucose level, 2-hour plasma glucose level during a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test, or HbA<sub>1c</sub> level, for all adults 45 years or older, regardless of risk factors, and screening adults who have overweight or obesity (BMI &ge;25 or &ge;23 in Asian American persons) with 1 or more risk factors, regardless of age. If the results are normal, it recommends repeat screening at a minimum of 3-year intervals. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinology<sup>49</sup> recommends universal screening for prediabetes and diabetes for all adults 45 years or older, regardless of risk factors, and screening persons with risk factors for diabetes (regardless of age).

This recommendation focuses on screening (ie, testing for vitamin D deficiency in asymptomatic adults and treating those found to have a deficiency), which differs from USPSTF recommendation statements on supplementation.</p>\r\n<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>\r\n<p>Although there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening for vitamin D deficiency, several factors are associated with lower vitamin D levels. Low dietary vitamin D intake may be associated with lower 25(OH)D levels.<sup>7</sup> Little or no UV B exposure (eg, because of winter season, high latitude, or sun avoidance) and older age are also associated with an increased risk for low vitamin D levels.<sup>8-12</sup> Obesity is associated with lower 25(OH)D levels,<sup>13</sup> and people who are obese have a 1.3- to 2-fold increased risk of being vitamin D&ndash;deficient, depending on the threshold used to define deficiency.<sup>8,9,13,14</sup> The exact mechanism for this finding is not completely understood.</p>\r\n<p>Depending on the serum threshold used to define deficiency, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency is 2 to 10 times higher in non-Hispanic Black persons than in non-Hispanic White persons, likely related to differences in skin pigmentation.<sup>7-9,14</sup> However, these prevalence estimates are based on total 25(OH)D levels, and controversy remains about whether this is the best measure of vitamin D status among different racial and ethnic groups.</p>\r\n<p>A significant proportion of the variability in 25(OH)D levels among individuals is not explained by the risk factors noted above, which seem to account for only 20% to 30% of the variation in 25(OH)D levels.<sup>11,15</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Treatment and Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>Vitamin D deficiency is usually treated with oral vitamin D. There are 2 commonly available forms of vitamin D&mdash;vitamin D<sub>3</sub> (cholecalciferol) and vitamin D<sub>2</sub> (ergocalciferol). Both are available as either a prescription medication or an over-the-counter dietary supplement.</p>\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>\r\n<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>\r\n<p>The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency varies based on how deficiency is defined. According to data from the 2011 to 2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, which used the liquid chromatography&ndash;tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assay to measure 25(OH)D levels, 5% of the population 1 year or older had very low 25(OH)D levels (&lt;12 ng/mL) and 18% had levels between 12 and 19 ng/mL.<sup>5</sup> (To convert 25[OH]D values to nmol/L, multiply by 2.496.)</p>\r\n<p>In some observational studies, lower vitamin D levels have been associated with risk for fractures, falls, functional limitations, some types of cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, depression, and death.<sup>16,17</sup> However, observations of these associations are inconsistent. This inconsistency may be because of different studies using different cutoffs to define a low vitamin D level or because vitamin D requirements and the optimal cutoff that defines a low vitamin D level or vitamin D deficiency may vary by individual or by subpopulation. For example, non-Hispanic Black persons have lower reported rates of fractures<sup>18</sup> despite having increased prevalence of lower vitamin D levels than White persons.<sup>7-9,14</sup> Further, it is unknown whether these associations are linked to causality.</p>\r\n<p>The goal of screening for vitamin D deficiency would be to identify and treat it before associated adverse clinical outcomes occur. Total 25(OH)D level is currently considered the best marker of vitamin D status.<sup>4,19</sup> A variety of assays can be used to measure 25(OH)D levels; however, levels can be difficult to measure accurately, and assays may underestimate or overestimate 25(OH)D levels. Additionally, the current evidence is inadequate to determine whether screening for and treatment of asymptomatic low 25(OH)D levels improve clinical outcomes in community-dwelling adults.</p>\r\n<h4>Potential Harms</h4>\r\n<p>Screening may misclassify persons with a vitamin D deficiency because of the uncertainty about the cutoff for defining deficiency and the variability of available testing assays. Misclassification may result in overdiagnosis (leading to nondeficient persons receiving unnecessary treatment) or underdiagnosis (leading to deficient persons not receiving treatment).</p>\r\n<p>A rare but potential harm of treatment with vitamin D is toxicity, which is characterized by marked hypercalcemia as well as hyperphosphatemia and hypercalciuria. However, the 25(OH)D level associated with toxicity (typically &gt;150 ng/mL)<sup>20</sup> is well above the level considered to be sufficient. In general, treatment with oral vitamin D does not seem to be associated with serious harms.<em>&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n<h4>Current Practice</h4>\r\n<p>The prevalence of screening for vitamin D deficiency by primary care clinicians in the US has not been well studied. Data suggest that laboratory testing for vitamin D levels has increased greatly over the last several years or longer. One study reported a more than 80-fold increase in Medicare reimbursement volumes for vitamin D testing from 2000 to 2010.<sup>21</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Other Related USPSTF Recommendations</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF has published recommendations on the use of vitamin D supplementation for the prevention of falls<sup>22</sup> and fractures<sup>23</sup> and vitamin supplementation for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or cancer.<sup>24</sup> These recommendations differ from the current recommendation statement in that they address vitamin D supplementation without first determining a patient's vitamin D status (ie, regardless of whether they have a deficiency).</p><h2>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h2><p>This recommendation updates the 2014 USPSTF recommendation statement on screening for vitamin D deficiency in asymptomatic adults. In 2014, the USPSTF concluded that the evidence was insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for vitamin D deficiency.<sup>25</sup> For the current recommendation statement, the USPSTF again concludes that the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for vitamin D deficiency in asymptomatic adults.</p>","other":"<h2>Supporting Evidence</h2><h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n<p>To update its 2014 recommendation statement, the USPSTF commissioned a systematic review<sup>26,27</sup> of the evidence on screening for vitamin D deficiency, including the benefits and harms of screening and early treatment. The review focused on asymptomatic, community-dwelling, nonpregnant adults 18 years or older who do not have clinical signs of vitamin D deficiency or conditions that could cause vitamin D deficiency, or for which vitamin D treatment is recommended, and who were seen in primary care settings.</p>\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>Total 25(OH)D levels can be measured by both binding and chemical assays. Serum total 25(OH)D levels are difficult to measure accurately, and different immunoassays can lead to underestimation or overestimation of total 25(OH)D levels.<sup>19</sup> LC-MS/MS is considered the reference assay. However, LC-MS/MS is a complicated process and is subject to variation and error, including interference from other chemical compounds.<sup>19</sup></p>\r\n<p>In 2010, the National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements, in collaboration with other organizations, initiated the Vitamin D Standardization Program.<sup>28,29</sup> The primary goal of the program has been to promote the standardized measurement of 25(OH)D levels. Most of the trials reviewed for this recommendation precede this standardization program. When previously banked samples have been reassayed using these standardized methods, both upward and downward revisions of 25(OH)D levels have been observed, depending on the original assay that was used.<sup>19,30,31</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no studies that directly evaluated the benefits of screening for vitamin D deficiency. The USPSTF did find 26 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and 1 nested case-control study that reported on the effectiveness of treatment of vitamin D deficiency (variably defined as a level &lt;20 ng/mL to &lt;31.2 ng/mL) on a variety of health outcomes, including all-cause mortality, fractures, incidence of diabetes, cardiovascular events and cancer, falls, depression, physical function, and infection.<sup>26,27</sup></p>\r\n<p>Eight RCTs and 1 nested case-control study reported on all-cause mortality in community-dwelling adults. Study duration ranged from 16 weeks to 7 years. In a pooled analysis of the 8 trials (n = 2006), there was no difference in all-cause mortality in persons randomized to vitamin D treatment compared with controls (relative risk [RR], 1.13 [95% CI, 0.39-3.28]).<sup>26,27</sup> In the Women&rsquo;s Health Initiative (WHI) Calcium&ndash;Vitamin D nested case-control study, there was no association between treatment with vitamin D and calcium and all-cause mortality among participants with baseline vitamin D levels between 14 and 21 ng/mL and among participants with baseline levels less than 14 ng/mL.<sup>32,33</sup></p>\r\n<p>Six RCTs reported on fracture outcomes in community-dwelling adults. Study duration ranged from 12 weeks to 7 years. A pooled analysis of the 6 trials (n = 2186) found no difference in the incidence of fractures among those randomized to vitamin D treatment compared with placebo (RR, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.58-1.21]).<sup>26</sup> The USPSTF found only 1 trial reporting on hip fracture in community-dwelling adults. In that study, only 1 hip fracture occurred, leading to a very imprecise effect estimate.<sup>34</sup> In the WHI Calcium&ndash;Vitamin D nested case-control study, there was no association between treatment with vitamin D and calcium and clinical fracture or hip fracture incidence.<sup>32</sup></p>\r\n<p>Five RCTs reported on incident diabetes. Study duration ranged from 1 year to 7 years. A pooled analysis of the 5 trials (n = 3356) found no difference in the incidence of diabetes among participants randomized to vitamin D treatment compared with placebo (RR, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.80-1.15]).<sup>26</sup></p>\r\n<p>For several outcomes, the USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the benefit of treatment of asymptomatic vitamin D deficiency. Limitations of the following evidence include few studies reporting certain outcomes and, for some outcomes, variable methods of ascertainment, variable reporting of outcomes, small study size, or short duration of follow-up.</p>\r\n<p>Two trials, the Vitamin D and Omega-3 Trial (VITAL) (n = 2001 in trial subgroup)<sup>35</sup> and the Vitamin D Assessment Study (ViDA) (n = 1270 in trial subgroup),<sup>36</sup> reported on cardiovascular events. Both trials observed no statistically significant differences in cardiovascular events between the treatment and placebo groups among the subgroup of participants with serum vitamin D levels less than 20 ng/mL at baseline. VITAL had 5.3 years of follow-up, while the ViDA trial had only 3.3 years of follow-up. The ViDA trial also used a heterogeneous definition of cardiovascular events, which included venous thromboembolism, pulmonary embolism, inflammatory cardiac conditions, arrhythmias, and conduction disorders.</p>\r\n<p>Two trials, VITAL35 and a post hoc analysis of the ViDA trial,<sup>37</sup> and the WHI nested case-control study<sup>38,39</sup> reported on the effect of vitamin D treatment on the incidence of cancer. Both trials reported no difference in cancer incidence between participants randomized to treatment and placebo among the subgroup of participants with serum 25(OH)D levels less than 20 ng/mL at baseline. The ViDA trial had only 3 years of follow-up, which may be a short period to detect an effect on cancer incidence. In the WHI Calcium&ndash;Vitamin D nested case-control study, the adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for incident breast or colorectal cancer over 7 years of follow-up did not demonstrate a statistically significant association between exposure to active treatment and incidence of cancer among participants with vitamin D deficiency at baseline.<sup>38,39</sup></p>\r\n<p>Nine trials reported fall outcomes in community-dwelling adults.<sup>26,27</sup> Some trials reported only falls, others only the number of participants who experienced 1 or more falls (ie, &ldquo;fallers&rdquo;), and some trials reported both outcomes. A pooled analysis of 6 trials found no association between vitamin D treatment and number of fallers (RR, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.75-1.08]), while a pooled analysis of 5 trials found a significant association between vitamin D treatment and falls (incidence rate ratio, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.57-0.94]).<sup>26,27</sup> However, heterogeneity was high in both analyses, ascertainment methods for falls and fallers were variable across studies, and the variable reporting of falls, fallers, or both outcomes raises the possibility of selective outcome reporting. One trial reported on the incidence of 2 or more falls, a different definition of &ldquo;fallers&rdquo; than in the trials included in the pooled analysis above. It found no significant difference between participants randomized to vitamin D or placebo among the subgroup of participants with baseline vitamin D levels less than 12 ng/mL (adjusted OR, 1.03 [95% CI, 0.59-1.79]) or among those with levels between 12 and 20 ng/mL (adjusted OR, 1.13 [95% CI, 0.87-1.48]).<sup>40</sup></p>\r\n<p>Three trials reported depression outcomes. One, VITAL-DEP (Depression Endpoint Prevention), was an ancillary study to the VITAL trial. Among the subgroup of participants with baseline serum vitamin D levels less than 20 ng/mL (n = 1328), there was no difference in the change in Personal Health Questionnaire Depression Scale scores between those randomized to vitamin D compared with placebo over a median follow-up of 5.3 years.<sup>41</sup> The other 2 trials were relatively small and of short duration. Both reported no significant difference in depression measures between vitamin D treatment and placebo.<sup>42,43</sup> Two trials reporting on physical functioning measures reported conflicting results.<sup>44,45</sup> An unplanned subgroup analysis of 1 trial conducted in persons with impaired fasting glucose found no difference in incidence of a first urinary tract infection in participants with vitamin D deficiency who were treated with vitamin D compared with placebo.<sup>46</sup></p>\r\n<p>As noted, the studies comprising the body of evidence cited above did not uniformly define vitamin D deficiency. Different studies enrolled participants with vitamin D levels that ranged from less than 20 ng/mL to less than 31.2 ng/mL. For those outcomes with sufficient data (mortality, fractures, and falls), findings were similar between studies using a lower threshold and studies using a higher threshold.<sup>26,27</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Screening and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no studies that directly evaluated the harms of screening for vitamin D deficiency. The USPSTF found 36 studies that reported adverse events and harms from treatment with vitamin D (with or without calcium) compared with a control group. The absolute incidence of adverse events varied widely across studies; however, the incidence of total adverse events, such as gastrointestinal symptoms, fatigue, musculoskeletal symptoms, and headaches, and serious adverse events was generally similar between treatment and control groups. In the 10 trials that reported incidence of kidney stones, there was only 1 case.<sup>26,27</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from September 22, 2020, to October 19, 2020. Some comments requested the USPSTF to evaluate the evidence on or make a recommendation regarding vitamin D supplementation. In response, the USPSTF wants to clarify that this recommendation focuses on screening for vitamin D deficiency. The USPSTF does have separate recommendations that address vitamin D supplementation (ie, providing vitamin D to all persons without testing, and regardless of vitamin D level) for a variety of conditions.<sup>22-24</sup> In response to comments, the USPSTF also wants to clarify that this recommendation applies to asymptomatic, community-dwelling adults. It does not apply to persons in institutional or hospital settings, who may have underlying or intercurrent conditions that warrant vitamin D testing or treatment. The USPSTF also wants to clarify that it did not review the emerging evidence on COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, and vitamin D.</p><h2>Research Needs and Gaps</h2><p>More studies are needed that address the following areas:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>More research is needed to determine whether total serum 25(OH)D levels are the best measure of vitamin D deficiency and whether the best measure of vitamin D deficiency varies by subgroups defined by race, ethnicity, or sex.</li>\r\n<li>More research is needed to determine the cutoff that defines vitamin D deficiency and whether that cutoff varies by specific clinical outcome or by subgroups defined by race, ethnicity, or sex.</li>\r\n<li>When vitamin D deficiency is better defined, studies on the benefits and harms of screening for vitamin D deficiency will be helpful.</li>\r\n</ul><h2>Recommendations of Others</h2><p>No organization recommends population-based screening for vitamin D deficiency, and the American Society for Clinical Pathology recommends against it.<sup>47</sup> The American Academy of Family Physicians supports the USPSTF 2014 recommendation, which states that there is insufficient evidence to recommend screening the general population for vitamin D deficiency.<sup>48</sup> The Endocrine Society<sup>49</sup> and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists<sup>50</sup> recommend screening for vitamin D deficiency in individuals at risk.

It does not apply to adults with conductive hearing loss, congenital hearing loss, sudden hearing loss, or hearing loss caused by recent noise exposure, or to persons reporting signs and symptoms of hearing loss.</p>\r\n<h3>Definition of Hearing Loss</h3>\r\n<p>The normal human ear can process sound frequencies from 20 to 20,000 Hz, with 500 to 4000 Hz being the most important range for speech processing.<sup>7</sup> There is no universally accepted definition for hearing loss because frequency and intensity (as measured in decibels) thresholds vary depending on the reference criteria used. However, many studies and guidelines define mild hearing loss as the inability to hear frequencies associated with speech processing under 25 dB and moderate hearing loss as the inability to hear those frequencies under 40 dB.<sup>8</sup></p>\r\n<p>Pure-tone audiometry is the most standard method for quantitative measurements of hearing; however, it is not always correlated with reported symptoms of hearing loss. There is often discordance between objectively measured deficits in hearing on pure-tone audiometry and subjective perceptions of hearing problems.<sup>9</sup> In one study, 1 in 5 persons who reported hearing loss had a normal hearing test result, while 6% of those with severe hearing loss detected on audiometry did not report feeling that they had hearing loss.<sup>10</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>\r\n<p>Increasing age is the most important risk factor for hearing loss. Presbycusis, a gradual, progressive decline in the ability to perceive high-frequency tones due to degeneration of hair cells in the ear, is the most common cause of hearing loss in older adults.</p>\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>Clinical tests to assess for potential hearing loss include the whispered voice, finger rub, and watch tick tests; however, they have questionable accuracy and have been shown to be operator dependent.<sup>8,11</sup> Perceived hearing loss can also be assessed by single-question screening (asking &ldquo;Do you have difficulty with your hearing?&rdquo;) or longer patient questionnaires such as the Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly&ndash;Screening (HHIE-S) questionnaire.<sup>12</sup> Technology such as the AudioScope (Welch Allyn), a handheld otoscope with a built-in screening audiometer, or tablet-based audiometry apps can also be used.<sup>13</sup> Diagnostic confirmation of a positive screening is typically performed with pure-tone audiometry. The finding of objective hearing loss indicates eligibility for an assistive hearing device but may not identify persons who will find the devices helpful and use them.</p>\r\n<h3>Treatment or Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>Mild or moderate sensorineural hearing loss (mild, 26 to 40 dB; moderate, 41 to 60 dB)<sup>14</sup> is primarily managed with hearing aids. For severe or profound hearing loss (severe, 61 to 80 dB; profound, &ge;81 dB),<sup>14</sup> cochlear implants and alternative communication techniques (ie, active listening training, speech reading) are potential treatment options.</p>\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>\r\n<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>\r\n<p>If left uncorrected, hearing loss can lead to significant hardship for patients, family members, and society. As persons age, moderate to severe hearing loss is associated with significantly higher impairment in instrumental activities of daily living such as driving and managing medications or finances, as well as impairment in basic activities of daily living such as ambulation, bathing, and toileting.<sup>15</sup></p>\r\n<p>Hearing loss is also associated with other adverse social and health outcomes, including social isolation, depression, and dementia.<sup>3</sup> Some evidence suggests that hearing loss is also associated with increased hospitalizations and higher rates of mortality.<sup>5,16,17</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Potential Harms</h4>\r\n<p>Because screening and confirmatory testing for hearing impairment are noninvasive and serious harms of treatment are rare, there are likely little to no adverse effects of screening for hearing loss. Potential or theoretical harms include anxiety, labeling, and stigma, as well as middle and outer ear conditions (ie, otitis externa, cerumen impaction) associated with hearing aid use, but these have not been adequately studied.</p>\r\n<h4>Current Practice</h4>\r\n<p>Accurate estimates of screening rates for hearing loss in adult primary care are not available. Older surveys indicate that primary care clinicians generally agreed that hearing loss negatively affects their patients but reported low screening rates.<sup>18</sup> Clinicians have reported barriers to screening and treatment of hearing loss, including issues such as lack of knowledge, poor perception of audiology services, lack of time, and lack of reimbursement.<sup>18-20</sup> Among persons seeking treatment for hearing loss, barriers to receiving care include a lack of awareness of hearing loss; confusion about options for accessing hearing-related care (eg, primary care assessment, audiology evaluation, or over-the-counter device); and decision-making related to treatment options, preferences, and cost.<sup>21</sup> Additionally, dissatisfaction or difficulties with using hearing aids may factor into the perceived effectiveness of these devices.<sup>21</sup> In 1 large study (n = 2305) of veterans eligible to receive free hearing aids, only 10% of all participants reported using devices after 1 year.<sup>22,23</sup> In the same study, among those without self-perceived hearing loss but with hearing loss diagnosed by audiometry, hearing aid use was 0% to 1.6%. These factors may limit the effectiveness of screening for and treatment of hearing loss.<sup>21</sup></p>\r\n<p>The benefit of earlier hearing aid use among persons with screen-detected mild hearing loss (with no or little perceived hearing-related functional impairment) is not clear. There is no standard of care or guideline consensus on when hearing aids are recommended, and early use of hearing aids does not prevent or delay further decline in age-related hearing loss.<sup>24,25</sup></p><h2>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h2><p>In 2012, the USPSTF found insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for hearing loss in asymptomatic adults 50 years or older.<sup>26</sup> The current recommendation statement is consistent with the 2012 statement.</p>","other":"<h2>Supporting Evidence</h2><h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF commissioned a systematic review<sup>8,27</sup> to update its 2012 recommendation on screening for hearing loss in adults 50 years or older. The scope of this review is similar to that of the prior systematic review.<sup>28</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening Tests and Risk Assessment</h3>\r\n<p>Thirty-four studies (6 good-quality and 28 fair-quality) evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of various screening modalities compared with pure-tone audiometry for the detection of hearing impairment in older adults<sup>8,27</sup> Nine studies evaluated a clinical test (eg, whispered voice, finger rub), 13 studies evaluated asking a single question, 11 studies evaluated a hearing questionnaire (eg, HHIE-S), and 10 studies evaluated a handheld or mobile-based audiometric device. Many studies assessed multiple screening tools.<sup>8,27</sup> Most studies included community-dwelling older adults enrolled from outpatient clinical or community settings, although 4 studies included adults in chronic care/rehabilitation facilities. Among the studies that reported age, the median age of study participants was 69 years.<sup>8,27</sup> Few studies provided racial, ethnic, or socioeconomic data on participants.</p>\r\n<p>Many studies reported on the accuracy of screening tests to detect hearing loss defined by multiple thresholds (eg, &gt;25 dB, &gt;40 dB) averaged over different frequencies; however, studies used slightly different thresholds and criteria (eg, whether 1 or both ears were affected) to define hearing impairment.<sup>8,27</sup> In general, studies considered hearing loss of 25 to 30 dB as mild hearing loss and loss of 35 to 40 dB as moderate hearing loss.</p>\r\n<p>Thirteen studies assessed the accuracy of single-question screening for detecting hearing loss.<sup>8</sup> For detecting mild hearing loss, the pooled sensitivity was 66% and pooled specificity was 76% (10 studies; n = 12,637).<sup>8,27</sup> For moderate hearing loss, the pooled sensitivity was 80% and pooled specificity was 74% (6 studies; n = 8774).</p>\r\n<p>Eleven studies assessed the accuracy of screening questionnaires, 8 of which assessed the accuracy of the HHIE-S.<sup>8,27</sup> Too few studies reported data to pool accuracy of the HHIE-S for detecting mild hearing loss. Across 4 studies (n = 7194), sensitivity of the HHIE-S ranged from 34% to 58% and specificity from 76% to 95%.<sup>8,27</sup> For detecting moderate hearing loss, the pooled sensitivity of HHIE-S (5 studies; n = 2820) was 68% and pooled specificity was 79%.<sup>8</sup> The Hearing Self-Assessment Questionnaire (HSAQ) and the Revised Five-Minute Hearing Test (RFMHT) were evaluated in 1 study each. For detecting mild hearing loss, the HSAQ had a sensitivity of 89% to 76% and specificity of 84% to 96%, based on 2 standard cutoffs. The sensitivity of the RFMHT for detecting mild hearing loss was 80% and specificity was 55%.<sup>8,27</sup></p>\r\n<p>The diagnostic accuracy of clinical tests (eg, whispered voice, watch tick, or finger rub) were evaluated in 9 studies.<sup>8,27</sup> Six of these assessed the accuracy of the whispered voice test at 6 inches, 2 feet, or both. For detecting mild hearing loss, the pooled sensitivity of the whispered voice test was 94% and specificity was 87%. Sensitivity for detecting at least moderate hearing loss, defined as more than 40 dB, ranged from 30% to 60% and specificity from 80% to 98%.<sup>8,27</sup> One study of whispered voice test accuracy found difference based on practitioner experience.<sup>8</sup> Other clinical tests, such as the finger rub and watch tick tests, were evaluated in few studies. In general, for both mild and moderate hearing loss, these tests had low sensitivity and high specificity.<sup>8,27</sup></p>\r\n<p>Ten studies evaluated the accuracy of various handheld audiometric screening devices.<sup>8,27</sup> Two studies assessed the accuracy of the AudioScope to detect mild (&gt;25 to &gt;30 dB) hearing loss and 4 studies assessed the accuracy for detecting moderate (&gt;40 dB) hearing loss. For mild hearing loss, sensitivity ranged from 64% to 93% and specificity ranged from 70% to 91%. There was relatively high sensitivity (range, 94%-100%) for detecting moderate hearing loss, although variable specificity (range, 24%-80%). Four studies assessed tablet-based audiometry apps designed for screening, although only 1, the uHear app, was reviewed in more than 1 study. It reported sensitivity between 68% and 100% and specificity between 87% and 89% for detecting moderate hearing loss (&gt;40 dB).<sup>8,27</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>Direct evidence of the effect of screening for hearing loss on clinical outcomes is limited. Only 1 fair-quality randomized clinical trial examined the effect of screening on health outcomes. The SAI-WHAT (Screening for Auditory Impairment&ndash;Which Hearing Assessment Test) trial (n = 2305) randomly assigned predominately male veterans 50 years or older to hearing loss screening with the AudioScope, HHIE-S questionnaire, or combined screening vs a control group of no screening.<sup>22,23</sup> The primary outcome was hearing aid use 1 year after screening. Included participants were predominantly men (94%), 50 years or older (mean age, 61 years), and recruited from a Veterans Affairs medical center. Three-fourths reported self-perceived hearing loss at baseline. Overall, hearing aid use across all study groups was low (&lt;10%) but significantly higher for those screened with the AudioScope or combined screening vs controls. Hearing aid use was very low among participants without baseline perceived hearing impairment (0% to 1.6%).<sup>22,23</sup> A secondary outcome of the trial was the effect of hearing aid use on quality of life. No statistically significant differences in quality of life scores were observed across the study groups after 1 year; however, the trial was not powered to detect differences in hearing-related function.<sup>8,27</sup> The generalizability of these results is limited, as this study was composed of relatively younger (mean age, 61 years) male veterans with a high prevalence of perceived hearing loss and who were eligible for free treatment services.</p>\r\n<p>Several trials reported on hearing aid use and changes in hearing-related function measured by the HHIE-S; however, clinically meaningful improvements in the HHIE-S associated with hearing aid use were limited to studies enrolling veterans who generally had greater baseline hearing impairment.<sup>8,27</sup> Four studies reported on general quality of life or function and other non&ndash;hearing-related health outcomes; of these studies, only 1 found significant benefit in favor of the intervention on the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire and the Geriatric Depression Scale. No study examined the effect of interventions on the incidence of dementia or neurocognitive impairment.<sup>8,27</sup> Overall, the population of white male veterans and higher prevalence of moderate hearing loss at study entry limits the generalizability of these findings.</p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Screening and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>No randomized trials or controlled observational studies evaluated potential adverse effects associated with screening or treatment of hearing impairment using hearing aids.<sup>8,27</sup> Potential harms include false-positive results that lead to unnecessary testing, treatment, or both; labeling; and anxiety. Harms related to treatment are thought to be minimal; however, potential harms of treatment include further hearing loss related to amplification or overamplification.<sup>29</sup> Some persons with quantitative hearing loss may not have <em>perceived</em> hearing loss or experience negative effects on their quality of life and may not benefit from screening or treatment. Such overdiagnosis and overtreatment could be considered a potential harm.</p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comments</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from September 8, 2020, to October 5, 2020. Many respondents felt that given the costs of hearing impairment (both to quality of life and financially), the USPSTF should recommend screening; however, the USPSTF requires evidence on benefits and harms to recommend a preventive service. The USPSTF recognizes the significant effects of hearing loss and provided more information about additional outcomes such as cognitive function and quality of life in its updated recommendation. Several comments expressed that readers might misinterpret the I statement as a recommendation against screening. In response, the USPSTF wishes to clarify that its I statement is a conclusion that the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for hearing loss and is neither a recommendation for nor against screening.</p>\r\n<p>Several comments questioned the scope of the recommendation and the USPSTF&rsquo;s decision to exclude populations (younger adults) and types of hearing loss (ie, conductive hearing loss, congenital hearing loss, sudden hearing loss, or noise-induced hearing loss), as well as those exhibiting early stage dementia. This recommendation focused on screening for sensorineural hearing loss, as it is the most common form of hearing loss in those older than 50 years. This type of hearing loss is both gradual and progressive and much more likely to be unrecognized by patients than other types of hearing loss.</p>\r\n<p>Several comments noted that newer screening modalities that provide objective measures of hearing loss were not considered by the USPSTF. The USPSTF&rsquo;s review included an assessment of several newer screening tools, some of which showed promise but had limited evidence.</p>\r\n<h3>How Does the Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?</h3>\r\n<p>Although sensorineural hearing loss is a relatively common consequence of aging, it has a gradual onset, so many older adults may not recognize that they have an impairment or may not perceive their sensory deficits to be a problem. Some individuals may alter their daily activities to adapt to the loss. Additionally, some older adults may resist seeking treatment for hearing impairment or adhering to use of a hearing aid because of fear of social stigma or a feeling of loss of independence, or discomfort associated with hearing aid use.</p>\r\n<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\n<p>More studies are needed that address the following areas.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The benefit of screening for and treatment of hearing loss in asymptomatic adults on health outcomes, such as quality of life and function, not just on hearing aid use or quality of hearing.</li>\r\n<li>The potential harms of screening and treatment, such as false-positive results and overtreatment.</li>\r\n<li>Consistent use of definitions of hearing loss to improve certainty about the accuracy of screening tests.</li>\r\n<li>The general adult population, as well as diverse subpopulations.</li>\r\n<li>The role of over-the-counter assistive hearing devices compared with prescription amplification devices.</li>\r\n<li>Screening tools that identify not just adults with hearing loss by audiometry definition criteria, but adults with unrecognized hearing loss that would benefit (the most) from amplification.</li>\r\n</ul><h2>Recommendations of Others</h2><p>Several organizations have issued statements about screening for hearing loss in older adults.

The incidence of perinatal HIV infection in the United States peaked in 1992<sup>6</sup> and has declined significantly following the implementation of routine prenatal HIV screening and the use of effective therapies and precautions to prevent mother-to-child transmission. Nearly 22,000 perinatal infections were prevented between 1994 and 2010 because of screening and preventive measures.<sup>7</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Detection</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found convincing evidence that currently recommended HIV tests are highly accurate in diagnosing HIV infection.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Benefits of Detection and Early Treatment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found convincing evidence that identification and early treatment of HIV infection is of substantial benefit in reducing the risk of AIDS-related events or death. The USPSTF found convincing evidence that the use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) is of substantial benefit in decreasing the risk of HIV transmission to uninfected sex partners. The USPSTF also found convincing evidence that identification and treatment of pregnant women living with HIV infection is of substantial benefit in reducing the rate of mother-to-child transmission. The overall magnitude of the benefit of screening for HIV infection in adolescents, adults, and pregnant women is substantial.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Harms of Detection and Early Treatment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that individual antiretroviral drugs, ART drug classes, and ART combinations are associated with some harms, including neuropsychiatric, renal, and hepatic harms and an increased risk of preterm birth in pregnant women. The overall magnitude of the harms of screening for and treatment of screen-detected HIV infection in adolescents, adults, and pregnant women is small.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">USPSTF Assessment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes with high certainty that the net benefit of screening for HIV infection in adolescents, adults, and pregnant women is substantial.</p>","clinical":"<h2>Clinical Considerations</h2><h3 align=\"left\"><a id=\"consider\" name=\"consider\"></a>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>\r\n<p>This recommendation applies to adolescents, adults, and all pregnant persons regardless of age. Based on the age-stratified incidence of HIV infection and data on sexual activity in youth, the USPSTF recommends screening for HIV infection beginning at age 15 years. Adolescents younger than 15 years and adults older than 65 years should be screened if they have risk factors for HIV infection.</p>\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Assessment of Risk</h3>\r\n<p>Although all adolescents and adults aged 15 to 65 years should be screened, there are a number of risk factors that increase risk. Among adolescents younger than 15 years and adults older than 65 years, clinicians should consider the risk factors of their patients, especially those with new sex partners, and offer testing to patients at increased risk.</p>\r\n<p>Most (67%) new diagnoses of HIV infection are attributed to male-to-male sexual contact,<sup>2</sup> and the estimated prevalence of HIV infection among men who have sex with men is 12%.<sup>3</sup> Injection drug use is another important risk factor for HIV infection; the estimated prevalence of HIV infection among persons who inject drugs is 1.9%.<sup>3</sup> In 2017, male individuals 13 years and older accounted for 81% of new diagnoses of HIV infection.<sup>2</sup> Most (83%) of these new diagnoses of HIV infection were attributed to male-to-male sexual contact, while 9% were attributed to heterosexual contact, 4% to injection drug use, and 4% to both male-to-male sexual contact and injection drug use.<sup>2</sup> Among female individuals 13 years and older, 87% of all new diagnoses were attributed to heterosexual contact and 12% to injection drug use.<sup>2</sup></p>\r\n<p>Additional risk factors for HIV infection include having anal intercourse without a condom, having vaginal intercourse without a condom and with more than 1 partner whose HIV status is unknown, exchanging sex for drugs or money (transactional sex), having other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) or a sex partner with an STI, and having a sex partner who is living with HIV or is in a high-risk category. Persons who request testing for STIs, including HIV, are also considered at increased risk.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF recognizes that these risk categories are not mutually exclusive, that the degree of risk exists on a continuum, and that persons may not be aware of the HIV or risk status of their sex partner or the person with whom they share injection drug equipment. Patients may also be reluctant to disclose risk factors to clinicians.</p>\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>Current CDC guidelines recommend testing for HIV infection with an antigen/antibody immunoassay approved by the US Food and Drug Administration that detects HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies and the HIV-1 p24 antigen, with supplemental testing after a reactive assay to differentiate between HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies.<sup>8,9</sup> If supplemental testing for HIV-1/HIV-2 antibodies is nonreactive or indeterminate (or if acute HIV infection or recent exposure is suspected or reported), an HIV-1 nucleic acid test is recommended to differentiate acute HIV-1 infection from a false-positive test result.<sup>8,9</sup></p>\r\n<p>Antigen/antibody tests for HIV are highly accurate, with reported sensitivity ranging from 99.76% to 100% and specificity ranging from 99.50% to 100%, and results can be available in 2 days or less.<sup>8</sup> Rapid antigen/antibody tests are also available.<sup>9</sup></p>\r\n<p>When using a rapid HIV test for screening, positive results should be confirmed. Pregnant women presenting in labor with unknown HIV status should be screened with a rapid HIV test to get results as soon as possible.</p>\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Screening Intervals</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found insufficient evidence to determine appropriate or optimal time intervals or strategies for repeat HIV screening. Repeat screening is reasonable for persons known to be at increased risk of HIV infection, such as sexually active men who have sex with men; persons with a sex partner who is living with HIV; or persons who engage in behaviors that may convey an increased risk of HIV infection, such as injection drug use, transactional sex or commercial sex work, having 1 or more new (ie, since a prior HIV test) sex partners whose HIV status is unknown, or having other factors that can place a person at increased risk of HIV infection (see the Assessment of Risk section). Repeat screening is also reasonable for persons who live or receive medical care in a high-prevalence setting, such as a sexually transmitted disease clinic, tuberculosis clinic, correctional facility, or homeless shelter. The CDC recommends annual screening in persons at increased risk<sup>10</sup> but recognizes that clinicians may wish to screen high-risk men who have sex with men more frequently (eg, every 3 or 6 months) depending on the patient&rsquo;s risk factors, local HIV prevalence, and local policies.<sup>11</sup> Routine rescreening may not be necessary for persons who have not been at increased risk since they last tested negative for HIV.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no evidence on the yield of repeat prenatal screening for HIV compared with 1-time screening during a single pregnancy. The CDC<sup>10</sup> and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)<sup>12</sup> recommend repeat prenatal screening for HIV during the third trimester of pregnancy in women with risk factors for HIV acquisition and in women living or receiving care in high-incidence settings, and the CDC notes that repeat screening for HIV during the third trimester in all women who test negative early in pregnancy may be considered. Women screened during a previous pregnancy should be rescreened in subsequent pregnancies.</p>\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>No cure or vaccine for HIV infection currently exists. However, early initiation of ART and other interventions effectively reduce the risk of clinical progression to AIDS, AIDS-defining clinical events, and mortality. Also, studies to date have shown that when ART leads to viral suppression, no cases of virologically linked HIV transmission have been observed. Interventions other than ART include prophylaxis for opportunistic infections when clinically indicated, immunizations, and cancer screening. In addition, ART treatment in pregnant women living with HIV and use of other precautions substantially decrease the risk of transmission to the fetus, newborn, or infant.</p>\r\n<p>The clinical treatment of HIV infection is a dynamic scientific field. The Panel on Antiretroviral Guidelines for Adults and Adolescents of the US Department of Health and Human Services regularly updates guidelines for HIV treatment regimens.<sup>13</sup></p>\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Additional Approaches to Prevention</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF recognizes that the most effective strategy for reducing HIV-related morbidity and mortality in the United States is primary prevention, or avoidance of exposure to HIV infection. Avoiding behaviors that may convey an increased risk of HIV infection and consistent use of condoms can decrease the risk of transmission of HIV and other STIs. The USPSTF recommends providing intensive behavioral counseling for all sexually active adolescents and for adults at increased risk of STIs.<sup>14</sup></p>\r\n<p>The Community Preventive Services Task Force has made several recommendations related to the prevention of HIV/AIDS and other STIs.<sup>15</sup></p>\r\n<p>Prophylactic intervention with antiretroviral medications, both preexposure and postexposure, can prevent HIV infection. Postexposure prophylaxis is used in persons who do not have HIV and may have been exposed to it via sexual contact, occupational or nonoccupational needle stick or other injury, or sharing injection drug equipment. When initiated soon after possible exposure, postexposure prophylaxis can prevent HIV infection. Preexposure prophylaxis is used in persons who do not have HIV and are at high risk of acquiring HIV infection. It consists of antiretroviral medication taken every day, before potential exposure. The USPSTF recommends offering preexposure prophylaxis to persons at high risk of HIV acquisition.<sup>16</sup></p>\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Useful Resources</h3>\r\n<p>More information about HIV and AIDS is available at <a href=\"http://HIV.gov\">HIV.gov</a><sup>17</sup> and from the CDC.<sup>18</sup> The CDC has made recommendations on screening for HIV in adolescents, adults, and pregnant women in health care settings<sup>10</sup> and the prevention of HIV transmission in adolescents and adults living with HIV;<sup>19</sup> guidelines on the use of ART and the potential adverse effects of ART are regularly updated at <a href=\"https://hivinfo.nih.gov/home-page\">https://hivinfo.nih.gov</a>.<sup>13</sup></p><h2>Other Considerations</h2><h3 align=\"left\">Implementation</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As recommended by the CDC, HIV screening should be voluntary and performed only with the patient&rsquo;s knowledge and understanding.<sup>10</sup> Patients should be informed orally or in writing that HIV testing will be performed unless they decline (known as &ldquo;opt-out screening&rdquo;). Patients should receive an explanation of HIV infection and the meaning of positive and negative test results. Patients should also be offered the opportunity to ask questions and to decline testing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The substantial benefit of screening is realized only if detection of HIV is followed by initiation of appropriate ART and provision of other services for persons found to have HIV. Thus, entry into care for persons identified as having HIV is essential. The CDC provides guidance on counseling, referral to care, treatment, and prevention of HIV transmission.<sup>19,20</sup> Clinicians should be aware that some persons with HIV may face substantial barriers to receiving appropriate services.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Research is needed on the yield of repeat vs 1-time screening for HIV and different repeat screening intervals to inform recommendations on optimal screening intervals. Data on optimal rescreening strategies in pregnant women are needed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Persons who initiate ART tend to continue receiving it for an extended length of time. Thus, continued research on the potential harms of long-term use of ART is an important research need. Further research is also needed to understand the effects of in utero exposure to ART on pregnancy outcomes and long-term effects in exposed children, to optimize the selection of ART regimens during pregnancy.</p><h2>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h2><p>In 2013, the USPSTF recommended screening for HIV infection in adolescents and adults aged 15 to 65 years, screening in younger adolescents and older adults at increased risk, and screening in all pregnant women.<sup>69</sup> The current updated recommendation continues to strongly recommend screening for HIV infection in adolescents and adults aged 15 to 65 years, younger adolescents and older adults at increased risk, and all pregnant persons.</p>","other":"<h2>Recommendations of Others</h2><p>In 2006, the CDC recommended routine voluntary screening for HIV infection in all adolescents and adults aged 13 to 64 years, regardless of other recognized risk factors, unless HIV prevalence was documented to be less than 0.1% within a patient community.<sup>10</sup> The CDC recommends that all persons should be screened at least once in their lifetime and those with risk factors be screened more frequently (eg, annually); the CDC also recently recommended that clinicians consider testing sexually active men who have sex with men more frequently (eg, every 3 to 6 months) based on risk behaviors, community HIV prevalence, and other considerations.<sup>11</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2009, the American College of Physicians recommended routine screening for HIV infection.<sup>70</sup> The Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends routine screening for HIV infection in all sexually active adults and pregnant women.<sup>71</sup> In 2017, ACOG reaffirmed a previous recommendation that all females aged 13 to 64 years be tested at least once in their lifetime and annually thereafter if they are assessed to have risk factors for HIV infection.<sup>72</sup> The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends universal screening for HIV infection once between the ages of 15 and 18 years, and annual reassessment and testing of persons at increased risk.<sup>73</sup> The American Academy of Family Physicians supports the 2013 USPSTF recommendations, except it recommends that routine screening begin at age 18 years and that only adolescents at increased risk be tested at younger ages.<sup>74</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The CDC,<sup>10</sup> ACOG,<sup>12</sup> American Academy of Pediatrics,<sup>75,76</sup> American College of Physicians,<sup>70</sup> and American Academy of Family Physicians<sup>74</sup> recommend routine screening for HIV infection in all pregnant women using an opt-out approach, and rapid screening for women who present in labor whose HIV status is unknown.

The USPSTF also commissioned a systematic evidence review<sup>24,25</sup> on the benefits (specifically, reduced risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV infection) and harms of screening for HIV infection in pregnant persons, the yield of repeat screening for HIV at different intervals during pregnancy, the effectiveness of currently recommended ART regimens for reducing mother-to-child transmission of HIV infection, and the harms of ART during pregnancy to the mother and infant.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Accuracy of Screening Tests</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Currently recommended antigen/antibody tests for HIV are highly accurate, with reported sensitivity ranging from 99.76% to 100% and specificity ranging from 99.50% to 100%.<sup>8</sup> Recommended rapid HIV tests have similar sensitivity and somewhat lower reported specificity ranging from 98.6% to 100%.<sup>26</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no randomized clinical trials (RCTs) or observational studies that compared clinical outcomes between adolescents and adults screened and not screened for HIV infection. The USPSTF found no studies that evaluated the yield of repeated screening for HIV compared with 1-time screening or that compared the yield of different strategies for repeat screening (eg, risk-based screening vs routine repeat testing or repeat screening at different intervals) in adolescents and adults. The USPSTF also found no studies comparing the yield of 1-time vs repeat screening or of different frequencies of screening for HIV infection in pregnancy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed 3 RCTs&mdash;the HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN 052) trial (n = 1763),<sup>27,28</sup> the International Network for Strategic Initiatives in Global HIV Trials Strategic Timing of Antiretroviral Treatment (INSIGHT START or START) trial (n = 4685),<sup>29</sup> and the Early Antiretroviral Treatment and/or Early Isoniazid Prophylaxis Against Tuberculosis in HIV-Infected Adults (TEMPRANO ANRS) trial (n = 2056)<sup>30</sup>&mdash;and 3 large fair-quality cohort studies, ranging in sample size from 3532 to 55,826 (total n = 63,478),<sup>31-33</sup> that provided evidence on the benefits of early initiation of ART.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The HPTN 052 trial randomly assigned participants to initiation of ART at CD4 cell counts of 350/mL<sup>3</sup> to 550/mL<sup>3</sup> or delayed initiation at CD4 cell counts of 250/mL<sup>3</sup> or less.<sup>27</sup> At a mean follow-up of 2.1 years, initiation of ART at higher CD4 counts was associated with decreased risk of AIDS-related events (4.5% vs 7.0%; relative risk [RR], 0.65 [95% CI, 0.44-0.95]). Effects on other outcomes (including all-cause mortality; AIDS-related mortality; and a composite outcome including death, serious AIDS-related events, and serious non&ndash;AIDS-related events, such as bacterial infection or cancer) favored early initiation of ART but were not statistically significant.<sup>28</sup> The START trial found decreased risk of a composite end point of all-cause mortality, serious AIDS-related events, and serious non&ndash;AIDS-related events,<sup>29</sup> and the TEMPRANO ANRS trial found decreased risk of a composite end point of all-cause mortality, progression to AIDS, AIDS-defining cancer, and non&ndash;AIDS-defining invasive bacterial disease<sup>30</sup> in participants treated with immediate ART at CD4 cell counts greater than 500/mL<sup>3</sup>, compared with delayed treatment at lower CD4 counts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 3 cohort studies<sup>31-33</sup> also provide evidence of benefit to early initiation of ART. Seven-year follow-up from the HIV Cohorts Analyzed Using Structural Approaches to Longitudinal (HIV CAUSAL) Collaboration showed that ART initiation at CD4 cell counts greater than 500/mL<sup>3</sup> was associated with decreased risk of all-cause mortality and a composite end point of progression to AIDS or death compared with initiation at CD4 cell counts less than 350/mL<sup>3</sup>.<sup>31</sup> A second cohort study from Canada found that initiation of ART at CD4 cell counts greater than 500/mL<sup>3</sup> was associated with lower probability of mortality and AIDS-related morbidity than initiation at CD4 cell counts less than 500/mL<sup>3</sup> or less than 350/mL<sup>3</sup>.<sup>32</sup> Last, a US-based cohort study found that compared with initiation of ART within 6 months of CD4 cell counts decreasing to less than 500/mL<sup>3</sup>, there were greater risks of 10-year all-cause mortality associated with ART initiation within 6 months of CD4 cell counts decreasing to less than 350/mL<sup>3</sup> (RR, 1.08 [95% CI, 1.00-1.16]) or 200/mL<sup>3</sup> (RR, 1.25&nbsp;[95% CI, 1.08-1.44]).<sup>33</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Early initiation of ART and viral suppression has also been shown to decrease risk of HIV transmission.<sup>27</sup> Longer-term follow-up from the HPTN 052 trial showed that early ART initiation is associated with a reduction in risk of HIV transmission to uninfected partners (RR for virologically linked transmission, 0.07 [95% CI, 0.02-0.22]),<sup>34</sup> and 3 observational studies (Partners of People on ART&mdash;A New Evaluation of the Risks [PARTNER],<sup>35</sup> PARTNER2,<sup>36</sup> and Opposites Attract<sup>37</sup>) found no cases of HIV transmission among serodiscordant couples when the partner living with HIV was treated with ART and had viral suppression, during 1238, 1593, and 232.2&nbsp;couple-years of follow-up, respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In its discussions about the age range for routine screening, the USPSTF considered the evidence on the age-stratified incidence of HIV infection and data on the prevalence of sexual activity in youth. Data from the CDC 2017 HIV Surveillance Report show a significant increase in HIV diagnoses in the United States starting at age 15 years (compared with ages 13-14 years).<sup>2</sup> In addition, 52% of youth in grades 9 through 12 reported engaging in sexual contact in the most recent Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance survey,<sup>38</sup> and in earlier survey data, approximately one-third of youth reported engaging in sexual intercourse before age 16 years.<sup>39</sup> CDC surveillance data also show a significant decrease in HIV diagnoses among adults 65 years and older.<sup>2</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no studies that compared rates of mother-to-child transmission of HIV infection between pregnant women screened and not screened for HIV infection. The USPSTF found several cohort studies and RCTs that provided evidence on the effectiveness of ART in decreasing rates of mother-to child transmission of HIV infection in pregnant women living with HIV.<sup>24,25</sup> The cohort studies, all conducted in North America, Europe, or Israel, reported rates of mother-to-child transmission of less than 1.0% to 2.8% among women treated with 3 antiretroviral drugs, compared with 9.1% to as much as 67% in 1 small cohort study among untreated women.<sup>24,25</sup> The RCTs were conducted in Africa or India (ie, settings with a lower United Nations Human Development Index than the United States) and compared the effects of a heterogeneous group of prenatal, peripartum, and postpartum ART interventions of varying durations on rates of mother-to-child transmission of HIV infection. Across all studies (both the cohort studies and RCTs), later initiation of ART during pregnancy or treatment with fewer than 3 antiretroviral drugs was associated with greater risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV infection.<sup>24,25</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Longer-term use of individual antiretroviral drugs and different ART regimens may be associated with several harms.

A meta-analysis of 26 trials found no association between abacavir use and risk of myocardial infarction,<sup>42</sup> but 2 cohort studies found that abacavir was associated with increased risk (RR, 1.98 [95% CI, 1.72-2.29] and odds ratio, 1.50 [95% CI, 1.26-1.79]).<sup>43,44</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The drug efavirenz has been linked to neuropsychiatric adverse events, including depression and suicidal ideation.<sup>45</sup> A systematic review (n = 8466; mean duration, 78 weeks) reported rates of neuropsychiatric adverse events among participants taking efavirenz; 29.6% (95% CI, 21.9%-37.3%) experienced events of any grade, 6.1% (95% CI, 4.3%-7.9%) experienced severe neuropsychiatric adverse events, 3.3% (95% CI, 2.2%-4.3%) had depression, and 0.6% (95% CI, 0.2%-1.1%) had suicidal ideation.<sup>46</sup> However, an analysis of the Data Collection on Adverse Events of Anti-HIV Drugs (D:A:D) study, a large (n &gt;49,000) international study of 11 prospective cohorts from Europe, Australia, and the United States, found no association between use of efavirenz and death from suicide,<sup>47</sup> and an analysis of a large (n = 19,983) US administrative cohort found no association between initiation of efavirenz and increased risk of suicidal ideation.<sup>48</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>An analysis of the D:A:D cohorts found that tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (relative rate, 1.46 [95% CI, 1.11-1.93]) and fosamprenavir (relative rate, 1.47 [95% CI, 1.01-2.15]) were associated with increased risk of end-stage liver disease or hepatocellular carcinoma, independent of viral hepatitis status, and that emtricitabine was associated with decreased risk of these outcomes (relative rate, 0.51 [95% CI, 0.32-0.83]).<sup>49</sup> However, the absolute risk of ART-related liver deaths in the D:A:D cohorts was low (0.04 deaths per 1000 person-years).<sup>50</sup> Another D:A:D analysis found an association between use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (rate ratio, 1.14 cases per year of exposure [95% CI, 1.10-1.19]) or ritonavir-boosted atazanavir (rate ratio, 1.20 cases per year of exposure [95% CI, 1.13 to 1.26]) and increased risk of chronic kidney disease.<sup>51</sup> A second observational study also found that tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was associated with an increased risk of renal adverse events,<sup>52</sup> and a third observational study found that tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was associated with kidney dysfunction, which was relatively mild and tended to be stable over several years.<sup>53</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A cohort study found that ever use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was associated with increased risk of fracture compared with nonuse (adjusted incidence rate ratio, 1.40&nbsp;[95% CI, 1.05-1.70]) after follow-up of more than 86 000 person-years. However, there was no difference in risk of fracture based on cumulative duration of use (adjusted incidence rate ratio per 5 years of exposure, 1.08 [95% CI, 0.94-1.25]).<sup>54</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed several studies that assessed the harms of ART during pregnancy.<sup>24,25</sup> One fair-quality RCT and 7 cohort studies found that antenatal ART was associated with increased risk of preterm birth (before 37 weeks of gestation) compared with no treatment or zidovudine monotherapy.<sup>55-62</sup> No clear associations were found between ART and overall birth defects, low birth weight, small size for gestational age, stillbirth, or neonatal death.<sup>24,25</sup> There were mixed findings on cardiovascular congenital anomalies.<sup>24,25</sup> Two studies of HIV-exposed, uninfected infants and children found that in utero exposure to ART was not associated with lower scores on Wechsler intelligence and achievement tests in children aged 7 to 13 years<sup>63</sup> and may be associated with less neurodevelopmental impairment<sup>64</sup> compared with no in utero exposure to ART.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Evidence on maternal harms associated with ART during pregnancy is limited. Three older studies suggest that ART (especially with a protease inhibitor) may be associated with an increased risk of gestational diabetes.<sup>65-67</sup> One RCT found no difference in risk of anemia between combination ART (zidovudine, lamivudine, and ritonavir-boosted lopinavir) starting at 28 to 36 weeks of gestation vs zidovudine monotherapy starting at 34 to 36 weeks of gestation until onset of labor, followed by zidovudine and a single dose of nevirapine at the onset of labor.<sup>68</sup> Another RCT found that treatment with zidovudine-based ART resulted in increased risk of maternal adverse events vs zidovudine monotherapy (21% vs 17%; <em>P</em> = 0.008) and increased risk of abnormalities in blood chemistry values (5.8% vs 1.3%; <em>P</em> &lt; 0.001), primarily elevated alanine aminotransferase levels.<sup>55</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes with high certainty that early detection and treatment of HIV infection would result in substantial benefits. Screening for HIV infection in all adolescents and adults aged 15 to 65 years, persons at increased risk of infection, and pregnant persons would allow for earlier and expanded detection of HIV infection, thus resulting in earlier medical and behavioral interventions and treatment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found convincing evidence that early initiation of ART for HIV infection, regardless of CD4 cell count, improves clinical outcomes and reduces the risk of sexual transmission. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the harms of early detection and treatment of HIV infection are small, and the clinical benefits of ART substantially outweigh the potential risks of treatment in persons living with HIV. The USPSTF also found convincing evidence that screening for HIV infection in pregnant women confers substantial clinical benefits for both the mother and infant, with adequate evidence that the potential harms are small.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the basis of these findings, the USPSTF concludes with high certainty that early detection and treatment of HIV infection results in substantial net benefit.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Diagnosis and initiation of treatment of HIV infection at the earliest stage possible is associated with improved health outcomes. Screening with highly accurate tests allows for diagnosis in the relatively long preclinical phase of HIV infection. Early treatment with ART has been shown to effectively suppress viral load and decrease the risk of AIDS-related events, serious non&ndash;AIDS-related events, and death in persons living with HIV infection. Effective treatment also decreases risk of sexual transmission of HIV by suppressing viral load in infected persons. Diagnosis and effective treatment in pregnant persons living with HIV decreases the risk of mother-to-child transmission by suppressing viral load and allowing for implementation of other prevention strategies (ie, appropriate antiretroviral treatment of the newborn and counseling about avoidance of breastfeeding).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from November 20 through December 26, 2018. In response to public comment, the USPSTF added information and clarified language regarding assessment of risk, high-prevalence HIV settings, and persons who may be at increased risk and warrant rescreening, as well as the importance of linkage to care after an HIV diagnosis. The USPSTF also clarified that persons not at increased risk may not need rescreening. The USPSTF clarified language describing the epidemiology of HIV and provided additional details on the HPTN 052 study. The USPSTF also added information about the data it considered in its discussions about the age at which to start and end routine screening.</p>","topic":"Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Infection: Screening","keywords":"HIV|Human Immunodeficiency Virus|Screening|Adult|Adolescent|Pregnant or pregnancy","pubDate":"2019-06-11","categories":["11"],"tool":["324","213","325"]},"441":{"topicType":"Screening","topicYear":2020,"uspstfAlias":"hepatitis-b-virus-infection-screening","specific":[1885],"title":"Hepatitis B Virus Infection in Adolescents and Adults: Screening","rationale":"<h2>Importance</h2><p>An estimated 862,000 persons in the US are living with chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV).<sup>1</sup> Persons born in regions with a prevalence of HBV infection of 2% or greater, such as countries in Africa and Asia, the Pacific Islands, and parts of South America, often become infected at birth and account for up to 95% of newly reported chronic infections in the US.

The USPSTF has made a separate recommendation on screening in pregnant women.<sup>8</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>\r\n<p>The risk for HBV infection varies substantially by country of origin in non&ndash;US-born persons living in the US. Persons born in countries with a prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) of 2% or greater (<a href=\"#tab2\">Table 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig\">Figure</a>) account for the majority of cases of new chronic HBV infection in the US; most persons in these countries acquired HBV infection from perinatal transmission.<sup>2</sup> Persons born in the US with parents from regions with higher prevalence are also at increased risk of HBV infection during birth or early childhood, particularly if they do not receive appropriate passive and active immunoprophylaxis (and antiviral therapy for pregnant women with a high viral load) (<a href=\"#fig\">Figure</a>).<sup>11-13</sup> The CDC classifies HBV endemicity levels by prevalence of positive HBsAg (high [8%], moderate [2%-7%], or low [&lt;2%]) (<a href=\"#fig\">Figure</a>). The estimated prevalence of HBV infection in the general US population is 0.3% to 0.5%,<sup>8,9,11,12,14,15</sup> which makes it reasonable to screen adolescents and adults born in countries or regions with an HBsAg prevalence of 2% or greater (regardless of vaccination history in their country of origin) and adolescents and adults born in the US who did not receive the HBV vaccine as infants and whose parents were born in regions with an HBsAg prevalence of 8% or greater (regardless of their biological mother&rsquo;s HBsAg status).</p>\r\n<p>HBV screening should also be offered to other risk groups defined by clinical and behavioral characteristics in which prevalence of positive HBsAg is 2% or greater. Persons from such risk groups include persons who have injected drugs in the past or currently; men who have sex with men; persons with HIV; and sex partners, needle-sharing contacts, and household contacts of persons known to be HBsAg positive<sup>2,3,9,12-14,16,17</sup> (<a href=\"#tab3\">Table 3</a>). Some persons with combinations of risk factors who are not members of risk factor groups listed above may also be at increased risk for HBV infection. Clinicians should therefore consider the populations they serve when making screening decisions.</p>\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>Screening for hepatitis B should be performed with HBsAg tests approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, followed by a confirmatory test for initially reactive results.<sup>2,18</sup></p>\r\n<p>A positive HBsAg result indicates chronic or acute infection. Serologic panels performed concurrently with or after HBsAg screening allow for diagnosis and to determine further management. (See the Additional Tools and Resources section for serologic test interpretation.)</p>\r\n<h3>Screening Intervals</h3>\r\n<p>For patients with negative HBsAg results who have not received the HBV vaccine series, periodic screening may be useful for those who report continued risk for acquiring HBV transmission, such as persons who continue to inject drugs and men who have sex with men. Clinical judgment should be used to determine screening frequency. The USPSTF found no evidence to determine optimal screening intervals.</p>\r\n<h3>Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>Persons with testing results indicative of acute or chronic HBV infection generally receive education about reducing the risk of transmission to others (eg, during childbirth or with sex and needle-sharing partners and household contacts).<sup>20</sup> Between 20% and 40% of patients with chronic HBV infection will require treatment<sup>4</sup> (see the Additional Tools and Resources section for information on treatment). Several antiviral medications are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of chronic HBV infection.<sup>21</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Implementation</h3>\r\n<p>Many persons at risk for HBV infection are not screened or vaccinated.<sup>4</sup> For example, approximately 11% to 67% of non&ndash;US-born persons and 28% to 52% of men who have sex with men have undergone HBV screening.<sup>4</sup> Low uptake of screening may be related to several barriers, including language, lack of awareness about HBV, limited access to health care, inability to access affordable treatment, stigmatization, concerns about suspension from jobs and other communal activities, and patients&rsquo; concerns about reporting and follow-up of screening results by public health authorities that may involve notification of close contacts.<sup>4,14,22-24</sup> When offering screening, clinicians should understand the positive and negative implications of reporting (as required by most US jurisdictions<sup>25</sup>), case investigations, and contact notification.<sup>24,26</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Additional Tools and Resources</h3>\r\n<p>Several tools may help clinicians implement this screening recommendation.

These studies found that screening based on broad criteria (immigration from countries with a high prevalence, other demographic risk factors, or behavioral risk factors) identified nearly all cases of HBV infection, with numbers needed to screen ranging from 32 to 148. Restricting screening to immigrants from high-prevalence (&ge;2%) countries was more efficient (numbers needed to screen ranging from 19 to 71) and identified 85% to 99% of patients with HBV infection in higher-prevalence clinical settings but missed about two-thirds of HBV infections in German primary care practices. The applicability of these studies to US primary care settings may be limited.<sup>11,19</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Benefits of Treatment on Intermediate Outcomes</h4>\r\n<p>Eighteen fair-quality trials (total N = 2972; n = 24-526; follow-up, 1.8-86 months) of antiviral therapy reported intermediate outcomes (eg, virologic suppression, normalization of alanine aminotransferase [ALT] levels, histologic improvement, and HBsAg loss or seroconversion) in persons aged 24 to 46 years. Six studies were conducted in the US or Europe. Trials evaluated first-line therapies (ie, therapies with the highest proven efficacy and safety, including nonpegylated interferon and entecavir) and alternate therapies (lamivudine and adefovir).<sup>11,19</sup></p>\r\n<p>Pooled analysis showed that antiviral therapy was statistically significantly more effective than placebo or no treatment in achieving histologic improvement, loss of HBsAg, loss of hepatitis B e-antigen (HBeAg), HBeAg seroconversion, virologic suppression, and normalization of ALT levels.<sup>11,19</sup> Although there were some differences in the magnitude of the effect when trials were stratified by geographic region, antiviral therapy was consistently associated with increased likelihood of virologic suppression across regions. Stronger effects were also seen in studies with less than 1 year of follow-up than in studies with longer follow-up.<sup>11,19</sup></p>\r\n<p>Twelve good- or fair-quality trials (N = 4127; n = 44-715; duration, 3.7-22 months) in adults compared first-line vs alternate regimens, specifically entecavir vs lamivudine (6 studies), entecavir vs telbivudine (2 studies), pegylated interferon vs lamivudine (1 study), or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) vs adefovir (3 studies). In 1 trial of pegylated interferon and in pooled analysis of 6 trials of entecavir, both first-line regimens achieved significantly higher virologic suppression or ALT normalization compared with lamivudine.<sup>11,19</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Benefits of Treatment on Health Outcomes</h4>\r\n<p>Seven fair-quality randomized trials (N = 1042; n = 42-356; duration, 12-86 months) compared the effects of antiviral therapy vs placebo or no treatment on cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, or mortality in adults. Three trials were conducted in the US or Europe; the remainder were conducted in Asia or multiple countries with varied HBsAg prevalence. Four trials assessed various interferon alfa regimens; 4 assessed lamivudine. Pooled analysis revealed that treatment was associated with significant reduction in mortality (3 trials; relative risk [RR], 0.15 [95% CI, 0.03-0.69]) and lower risk of incident cirrhosis (2 trials; RR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.29-1.77]) or hepatocellular carcinoma (4 trials; RR, 0.60 [95% CI, 0.16-2.33]) that were not statistically significant. None of the trials evaluated effects of antiviral therapy in adolescents or how effects varied by age, race/ethnicity, or sex.<sup>11,19</sup></p>\r\n<p>Seven fair-quality cohort studies (N = 50,912; n = 632-43 190; duration, 2.7-8.9 years) compared antiviral therapy with no antiviral therapy in adults in the US (2 trials) or Asia (5 trials). Most studies adjusted for patient age, sex, and stage of fibrosis; some also adjusted for level of HBV DNA, ALT levels, or medical comorbid conditions. The trials assessed lamivudine (1 trial), entecavir (1 trial), or various regimens (5 trials). All studies found that antiviral therapy was associated with a decreased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (adjusted hazard ratios [HRs] ranged from 0.24 to 0.64), including 2 US studies with median follow-up of 5.2 years (adjusted HR, 0.39 [95% CI, 0.27-0.56]) or 8.9 years (adjusted HR, 0.24 [95% CI, 0.15-0.39]).<sup>11,19</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Association Between Intermediate Outcomes and Health Outcomes</h4>\r\n<p>Nine fair-quality cohort studies (N = 3893; n = 63-1531; duration, 3.2-9.9 years) assessed the association between intermediate outcomes after treatment and health outcomes in adults in the US or Europe (6 trials) or Asia (3 trials) with varied baseline characteristics (eg, HBeAg status, presence of cirrhosis). The trials assessed interferon (6 trials), entecavir (2 trials), or lamivudine (1 trial). HBeAg loss or seroconversion was associated with a lower risk of cirrhosis (1 trial; adjusted HR, 0.41 [95% CI, 0.32-0.88]), hepatocellular carcinoma (1 trial; adjusted HR, 0.13 [95% CI, 0.08-0.57]), or a composite health outcome (1 trial; adjusted HR, 0.06 [95% CI, 0.01-0.61]). Other studies found associations between virologic suppression, ALT normalization, histologic improvement, or composite intermediate outcomes and a lower risk of hepatocellular carcinoma or composite health outcomes, but several associations were not statistically significant.<sup>11,19</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>No randomized clinical trials comparing HBV screening with no screening currently exist to provide direct evidence of the harms of screening.<sup>11,19</sup></p>\r\n<p>Twelve trials (N = 2106) reported on harms of treatment compared with no treatment or placebo. Pooled analyses found no significant differences in the risk of serious adverse events (4 trials; RR, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.45-1.85]), any adverse event (5 trials; RR, 1.01 [95% CI, 0.90-1.11]), renal adverse events (3 trials; RR, 1.27 [95% CI, 0.31-3.55]), or study withdrawal due to adverse events (3 trials; RR, 4.44 [95% CI, 0.95-20.77]). Nine trials (N = 3408) compared harms of first-line antiviral regimens with harms of alternate regimens. Pegylated interferon was associated with an increased risk of any adverse event compared with lamivudine in 1 trial (N = 543; RR, 1.58 [95% CI, 1.41-1.78]). No significant differences in risk of serious adverse events or withdrawal due to adverse events were found in trials that compared entecavir with lamivudine or compared TDF with adefovir. One fair-quality cohort study of Asian patients in the US (n = 1224) that compared risk of incident osteopenia or osteoporosis in patients treated with TDF or entecavir with patients receiving no therapy found no significant differences in these outcomes.<sup>11,19</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comments</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from May 5, 2020, through June 1, 2020. Respondents expressed concern that various high-risk populations were not discussed, requested additional information on follow-up testing, and expressed concerns about implementation. In the Additional Tools and Resources section, the USPSTF provides links to additional risk factors, lists tools and resources to help clinicians assess HBV risk, and discusses hepatitis B serologic tests in detail.

The CDC, the American College of Physicians, and the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases recommend screening for HBV infection in asymptomatic, high-risk persons, including all persons born in countries with an HBsAg prevalence of 2% or greater regardless of vaccination history; US-born persons not vaccinated as infants whose parents were born in regions with an HBsAg prevalence of 8% or greater; persons who inject drugs; men who have sex with men; and persons with HIV infection, persons with hepatitis C virus infection, inmates of correctional facilities, and household contacts and sexual partners of HBsAg-positive persons.<sup>2,4,21,33</sup> Both the CDC and the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases also recommend screening patients with conditions requiring immunosuppressive therapy, predialysis, hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, or home dialysis; patients who have elevated ALT levels of unknown etiology; or developmentally disabled persons and staff in residential facilities.<sup>2,4,21</sup> The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases also recommends screening persons with multiple sexual partners or a history of sexually transmitted infections.<sup>21</sup> The American Academy of Family Physicians<sup>34</sup> endorses the 2014 USPSTF recommendation on HBV screening.</p>","topic":"Hepatitis B Virus Infection in Adolescents and Adults: Screening","keywords":"Hepatitis B","pubDate":"2020-12-15","categories":["11"],"tool":["327","335","334","333","332","331","330","329","328"]},"443":{"topicType":"Screening","topicYear":2021,"uspstfAlias":"colorectal-cancer-screening","specific":[1928,1929,1930],"title":"Colorectal Cancer: Screening","rationale":"<h2>Importance</h2><p>Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer death for both men and women, with an estimated 52,980 persons in the US projected to die of colorectal cancer in 2021.<sup>1</sup> Colorectal cancer is most frequently diagnosed among persons aged 65 to 74 years.<sup>2</sup> It is estimated that 10.5% of new colorectal cancer cases occur in persons younger than 50 years.<sup>3</sup> Incidence of colorectal cancer (specifically adenocarcinoma) in adults aged 40 to 49 years has increased by almost 15% from 2000-2002 to 2014-2016.<sup>4</sup> In 2016, 25.6% of eligible adults in the US had never been screened for colorectal cancer<sup>5</sup> and in 2018, 31.2% were not up to date with screening.<sup>6</sup></p><h2>USPSTF Assessment of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h2><p>The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) concludes with high certainty that screening for colorectal cancer in adults aged 50 to 75 years has <strong>substantial net benefit</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for colorectal cancer in adults aged 45 to 49 years has <strong>moderate net benefit</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for colorectal cancer in adults aged 76 to 85 years who have been previously screened has <strong>small net benefit</strong>.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) Grades and Levels of Evidence</p>","clinical":"<h2>Practice Considerations</h2><h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>\r\n<p>This recommendation applies to asymptomatic adults 45 years or older who are at average risk of colorectal cancer (ie, no prior diagnosis of colorectal cancer, adenomatous polyps, or inflammatory bowel disease; no personal diagnosis or family history of known genetic disorders that predispose them to a high lifetime risk of colorectal cancer [such as Lynch syndrome or familial adenomatous polyposis]).</p>\r\n<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>\r\n<p>Age is one of the most important risk factors for colorectal cancer, with incidence rates increasing with age and nearly 94% of new cases of colorectal cancer occurring in adults 45 years or older.<sup>2</sup> Rates of colorectal cancer incidence are higher in Black adults and American Indian and Alaskan Native adults,<sup>2</sup> persons with a family history of colorectal cancer (even in the absence of any known inherited syndrome such as Lynch syndrome or familial adenomatous polyposis),<sup>8</sup> men,<sup>2</sup> and persons with other risk factors (such as obesity, diabetes, long-term smoking, and unhealthy alcohol use).<sup>9</sup> However, all adults 45 years or older should be offered screening, even if these risk factors are absent.</p>\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>The risks and benefits of different screening tests vary. See <a href=\"#tab1\">Table 1</a> for characteristics of recommended screening strategies, which may include combinations of screening tests. Because of limited available evidence,<sup>9,10</sup> the USPSTF recommendation does not include serum tests, urine tests, or capsule endoscopy for colorectal cancer screening. Recommended stool-based and direct visualization screening tests are described below.</p>\r\n<h4>Stool-Based Tests</h4>\r\n<p>Stool-based tests include the high-sensitivity guaiac fecal occult blood test (gFOBT), fecal immunochemical test (FIT), and stool DNA test. Both high-sensitivity gFOBT and FIT detect blood in the stool; however, they use different methods. High-sensitivity gFOBT is based on chemical detection of blood, while FIT uses antibodies to detect blood.<sup>11</sup> Stool DNA tests detect DNA biomarkers for cancer in cells shed from the lining of the colon and rectum into stool.<sup>11</sup> Currently, the only stool DNA test approved by the US Food and Drug Administration is a multitarget stool DNA test that also includes a FIT component, referred to as sDNA-FIT in this recommendation. When stool-based tests reveal abnormal results, follow-up with colonoscopy is needed for further evaluation. Among the stool-based tests, screening with annual FIT or annual sDNA-FIT provides an estimated greater life-years gained than annual high-sensitivity gFOBT or sDNA-FIT every 3 years.<sup>12,13</sup> Additionally, modeling estimates that screening with sDNA-FIT annually would result in more colonoscopies than annual screening with FIT.<sup>12,13</sup> However, sDNA-FIT every 1 to 3 years is estimated to provide a reasonable balance of life years gained per estimated follow-up colonoscopy compared with no screening. Currently, there is uncertainty around the accuracy of high-sensitivity gFOBT to detect colorectal cancer and advanced adenomas, although it is likely lower than the accuracy of FIT and sDNA-FIT, and high-sensitivity gFOBT is more difficult for patients to administer.<sup>9,10</sup> However, randomized trials demonstrate direct evidence of decreased deaths from colorectal cancer when screening with non&ndash;high-sensitivity gFOBT is performed.<sup>9,10</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Direct Visualization Tests</h4>\r\n<p>Direct visualization tests to screen for colorectal cancer include colonoscopy, CT colonography, and flexible sigmoidoscopy. All 3 screening tests visualize the inside of the colon and rectum, although flexible sigmoidoscopy can only visualize the rectum, sigmoid colon, and descending colon, while colonoscopy and CT colonography can generally visualize the entire colon. For colonoscopy and flexible sigmoidoscopy, a camera is used to visualize the inside of the colon, while CT colonography uses x-ray images. When abnormal results are found on flexible sigmoidoscopy or CT colonography, follow-up with colonoscopy is needed for further evaluation. Among the direct visualization tests, a colonoscopy every 10 years or CT colonography every 5 years have greater estimated life-years gained than flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years.<sup>12,13</sup> Unlike colonoscopy and flexible sigmoidoscopy, CT colonography may reveal extracolonic findings that require additional workup, which could lead to other potential benefits or harms.<sup>9,10</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Starting and Stopping Ages</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF recommends offering colorectal cancer screening starting at age 45 years. Although the absolute risk of developing colorectal cancer is much lower in adults younger than 50 years (20.0 new colorectal cancer cases per 100,000 persons aged 40 to 49 years, 47.8 new cases per 100,000 persons aged 50 to 59 years, and 105.2 new cases per 100,000 persons 60 years or older<sup>14</sup>), age-period-cohort analysis indicates a recent trend for increasing risk of colorectal cancer in birth cohorts of adults younger than 50 years.<sup>15</sup> The benefit of reducing colorectal cancer deaths by screening for colorectal cancer in adults 50 years or older is well established through trial data. Some of these trials<sup>16-18</sup> also included adults younger than 50 years, although results are not reported separately for younger age groups. Additionally, modeling performed by the Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET) suggests that starting colorectal cancer screening at age 45 years may moderately increase life-years gained and decrease colorectal cancer cases and deaths compared with beginning screening at age 50 years.<sup>12,13</sup></p>\r\n<p>In adults aged 76 to 85 years, the age at which the balance of benefits and harms of colorectal cancer screening becomes less favorable and screening should be stopped varies based on a patient&rsquo;s health status (eg, life expectancy, comorbid conditions), prior screening status, and individual preferences.<sup>19</sup> Limited evidence suggests that harms from colonoscopy, such as perforation and bleeding, and extracolonic findings on CT colonography increase with age.<sup>9,10</sup> Modeling studies estimate that generally, few additional life-years are gained when screening is extended past age 75 years among average-risk adults who have previously received adequate screening.<sup>12,13</sup></p>\r\n<p>In adults 86 years or older, evidence on benefits and harms of colorectal cancer screening is lacking, and competing causes of mortality likely preclude any survival benefit that would outweigh the harms of screening.</p>\r\n<h3>Screening Intervals</h3>\r\n<p>Recommended intervals for colorectal cancer screening tests include</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>High-sensitivity gFOBT or FIT every year</li>\r\n<li>sDNA-FIT every 1 to 3 years</li>\r\n<li>CT colonography every 5 years</li>\r\n<li>Flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years</li>\r\n<li>Flexible sigmoidoscopy every 10 years + FIT every year</li>\r\n<li>Colonoscopy screening every 10 years</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Treatment or Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>Localized cancer is generally treated with surgical resection.<sup>20</sup> Depending on cancer location and stage/progression, additional treatment options may include adjuvant chemotherapy, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, chemoradiation, and targeted therapies.<sup>20,21</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Screening for Colorectal Cancer in Black Adults</h3>\r\n<h4>Colorectal Cancer Burden</h4>\r\n<p>Black adults have the highest incidence of and mortality from colorectal cancer compared with other races/ethnicities. From 2013 to 2017, incidence rates for colorectal cancer were 43.6 cases per 100,000 Black adults, 39.0 cases per 100,000 American Indian/Alaska Native adults, 37.8 cases per 100,000 White adults, 33.7 cases per 100,000 Hispanic/Latino adults, and 31.8 cases per 100,000 Asian/Pacific Islander adults.<sup>22</sup> Colorectal cancer death rates in 2014 to 2018 were 18.0 deaths per 100,000 Black adults, 15.1 deaths per 100,000 American Indian/Alaska Native adults, 13.6 deaths per 100,000 non-Hispanic White adults, 10.9 deaths per 100,000 Hispanic/Latino adults, and 9.4 deaths per 100,000 Asian/Pacific Islander adults.<sup>23</sup></p>\r\n<p>The causes for these health disparities are complex; recent evidence points to inequities in the access to and utilization and quality of colorectal cancer screening and treatment as the primary driver for this health disparity rather than genetic differences.<sup>24,25</sup> The recent trend for increasing colorectal cancer incidence in adults younger than 50 years has been observed in White and Hispanic/Latino adults but not Black or Asian/Pacific Islander adults.<sup>26</sup> However, despite these trends, Black adults across all age groups, including those younger than 50 years, continue to have a higher incidence of and mortality from colorectal cancer than White adults.</p>\r\n<h4>Available Evidence</h4>\r\n<p>The USPSTF sought evidence on the potential benefits and harms of colorectal cancer screening in Black adults; however, little empirical evidence was identified. Although some studies on the effectiveness of colorectal cancer screening included non-White participants, no studies reported results of screening by race/ethnicity.<sup>9,10</sup> Few studies on screening accuracy reported findings by race; however, those studies that did generally found no difference in accuracy to detect colorectal cancer in Black adults compared with White adults for FIT (in 1 study<sup>27</sup>) or sDNA-FIT (in 1 study<sup>28</sup>). The 4 studies of screening colonoscopy that reported harms by race/ethnicity had inconsistent findings. No other studies on harms reported results by race/ethnicity. Modeling studies that assume perfect adherence to screening and no racial differences in screening accuracy or natural history of colorectal cancer (ie, no biological differences in the risks of adenoma onset and progression to colorectal cancer),<sup>25</sup> but lower relative colorectal cancer survival rates<sup>29</sup> and increased all-cause mortality in Black adults vs White adults,<sup>30</sup> estimate similar life-years gained from screening Black adults and White adults and a similar balance of the benefits and harms for each screening strategy.<sup>12,13</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Advising Black Adults</h4>\r\n<p>Based on the limited available empirical evidence, the USPSTF is not able to make a separate, specific recommendation on colorectal cancer screening in Black adults. Results from CISNET modeling also do not support different screening strategies by race.<sup>12,13</sup> Other organizations such as the US Multi-Society Task Force recommend starting screening in Black adults at age 45 years while starting screening at age 50 years for persons of other races.<sup>31</sup> The current USPSTF statement recommends starting screening for everyone at age 45 years, including Black adults.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF recognizes the higher colorectal cancer incidence and mortality in Black adults and strongly encourages clinicians to ensure their Black patients receive recommended colorectal cancer screening, follow-up, and treatment. The USPSTF encourages the development of systems of care to ensure adults receive high-quality care across the continuum of screening and treatment, with special attention to Black communities, which historically experience worse colorectal cancer health outcomes.</p>\r\n<h3>Implementation</h3>\r\n<p>Maintaining comparable benefits and harms of screening with the various strategies requires that patients, clinicians, and health care organizations adhere to currently recommended protocols for screening intervals, follow-up colonoscopy, and treatment. Each screening test has different considerations for implementation that may facilitate patient uptake of and adherence to screening or serve as a barrier to screening (see <a href=\"#tab1\">Table 1</a> for additional details). Implementation considerations include where the screening test is performed, who performs the screening procedure, the need for preprocedure bowel preparation, the need for anesthesia or sedation during the test, and follow-up procedures for abnormal findings on a screening test. These considerations have implications for how feasible and preferable a given screening test is for an individual. Discussion of implementation considerations with patients may help better identify screening tests that are more likely to be completed by a given individual.</p>\r\n<h4>Stool-Based Tests</h4>\r\n<p>Stool-based screening requires persons to collect samples directly from their feces, which may be unpleasant for some, but the test is quick and noninvasive and can be done at home (the sample is mailed to the laboratory for testing), and no bowel preparation is needed to perform the screening test. The benefits of stool-based testing accrue over frequent, repeated testing, thus requiring commitment and adherence to screening intervals to achieve a substantial benefit in decreased colorectal cancer mortality.</p>\r\n<p>Positive results on stool-based screening tests require follow-up with colonoscopy for the screening benefits to be achieved. Screening with high-sensitivity gFOBT requires some dietary and medication restrictions prior to collecting stool samples,<sup>32</sup> while FIT and sDNA-FIT<sup>33,34</sup> do not. Test specimens can be collected from a single stool sample with FIT and sDNA-FIT<sup>33,34</sup> (sDNA-FIT involves collecting an entire bowel movement), while collection of samples from 3 separate bowel movements is required for high-sensitivity gFOBT screening.<sup>32</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Direct Visualization Tests</h4>\r\n<p>Screening by direct visualization tests must be performed in a clinical setting rather than in the home. When performed alone, direct visualization tests allow for a much longer time between screenings compared with stool-based screening. Colonoscopy has the longest length between screenings (10 years when screening results are negative), whereas flexible sigmoidoscopy and CT colonography allow 5 years between screenings if performed alone. Direct visualization tests all require bowel preparation prior to the screening test, although specific regimens may depend on the specific screening test being performed.<sup>35</sup> The use of sedation or anesthesia during the procedure also varies by screening test. Sedation or anesthesia is usually used during colonoscopy; hence, assistance with transportation home and recovery time after colonoscopy is required.<sup>36</sup> Abnormal findings identified by flexible sigmoidoscopy or CT colonography screening require follow-up colonoscopy for screening benefits to be achieved.</p>\r\n<h3>Additional Tools and Resources</h3>\r\n<p>The National Cancer Institute and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have developed patient and clinician guides on screening for colorectal cancer:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Colorectal Cancer Screening (PDQ)&mdash;Patient Version<br /><a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/types/colorectal/patient/colorectal-screening-pdq\">https://www.cancer.gov/types/colorectal/patient/colorectal-screening-pdq</a></li>\r\n<li>Colorectal Cancer Screening (PDQ)&mdash;Health Professional Version<br /><a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/types/colorectal/hp/colorectal-screening-pdq\">https://www.cancer.gov/types/colorectal/hp/colorectal-screening-pdq</a></li>\r\n<li>Colorectal Cancer Screening Tests<br /><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/colorectal/basic_info/screening/tests.htm\">https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/colorectal/basic_info/screening/tests.htm</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The Community Preventive Services Task Force has also issued recommendations on interventions to increase colorectal cancer screening at <a href=\"https://www.thecommunityguide.org/content/task-force-findings-cancer-prevention-and-control\">https://www.thecommunityguide.org/content/task-force-findings-cancer-prevention-and-control</a>.</p>\r\n<h3>Other Related USPSTF Recommendations</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF has a recommendation statement on aspirin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and colorectal cancer in average-risk adults (available at <a href=\"https://uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org\">https://uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>).<sup>37</sup></p><h2>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h2><p>This final recommendation replaces the 2016 USPSTF recommendation on screening for colorectal cancer. In 2016, the USPSTF recommended screening for colorectal cancer starting at age 50 years and continuing until age 75 years (A recommendation). In addition, the USPSTF concluded that the decision to screen for colorectal cancer in adults aged 76 to 85 years should be an individual one, taking into account the patient&rsquo;s overall health and prior screening history (C recommendation) and that screening should be discontinued after age 85 years.</p>\r\n<p>In the current recommendation, while continuing to recommend colorectal cancer screening in adults aged 50 to 75 years (A recommendation), the USPSTF now recommends offering screening starting at age 45 years (B recommendation). As it did in 2016, the USPSTF continues to conclude that screening in adults aged 76 to 85 years should be an individual decision (C recommendation) and screening should be discontinued after age 85 years.</p>","other":"<h2>Research Needs and Gaps</h2><p>Although the benefits of screening for colorectal cancer are well established, the following important evidence gaps that need to be addressed by additional research persist.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Randomized trials that directly compare the effectiveness of different colorectal cancer screening strategies (including hybrid strategies that switch between modalities over time) to reduce colorectal cancer mortality are needed.</li>\r\n<li>Studies are needed on screening effectiveness in adults younger than 50 years and whether screening strategies should be tailored in these populations.</li>\r\n<li>More research is needed to understand the factors that contribute to increased colorectal cancer incidence and mortality in Black adults, such as access to and availability of care and characteristics of systems providing health care. Once these factors are identified, more research is needed to test interventions designed to mitigate these differences for Black adults.</li>\r\n<li>More studies evaluating the direct effectiveness of screening with sDNA-FIT on colorectal cancer mortality outcomes and studies that report outcomes of patients who receive abnormal sDNA-FIT results but subsequently negative colonoscopy results are needed.</li>\r\n<li>More studies evaluating the direct effectiveness of screening with CT colonography on colorectal cancer mortality are needed, as well as more studies that report on long-term consequences of identifying extracolonic findings on colorectal cancer screening.</li>\r\n<li>More research is needed to understand the uptake of and adherence to individual screening tests (such as adherence to repeated screening colonoscopy after 10 years and repeated stool tests annually) and the effect adherence has on the overall benefits of a screening program. Similarly, more research is needed on the accuracy and effectiveness of emerging screening technologies such as serum- and urine-based colorectal cancer screening tests and capsule endoscopy tests to potentially improve acceptance and adherence to colorectal cancer screening, if found to be accurate and effective.</li>\r\n</ul><h2>Recommendations of Others</h2><p>Many organizations have issued guidelines on screening for colorectal cancer. There is a general consensus that average-risk adults aged 50 to 75 years should be screened. The American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP),<sup>42</sup> American College of Physicians (ACP),<sup>43</sup> American Cancer Society (ACS),<sup>44</sup> and the US Multi-Society Task Force (which includes the American College of Gastroenterology, American Gastroenterological Association, and American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy)<sup>31</sup> all recommend routine colorectal cancer screening in this age group, although specific recommended tests and frequency of screening may vary. Currently, where recommendations and guidelines vary is the age to initiate screening. In 2017, the US Multi-Society Task Force recommended beginning screening at age 45 years in Black adults (weak recommendation) and screening at age 40 years (or 10 years before the age at diagnosis of a family member, whichever is earlier) in persons with a family history for colorectal cancer. In 2018, the ACS recommended that screening begin at age 45 years in all adults (qualified recommendation). The AAFP&rsquo;s recommendations do not address screening before age 50 years. In 2021, the American College of Gastroenterology suggested screening in average-risk persons aged 45 to 49 years (conditional recommendation) and recommended screening average-risk persons aged 50 to 75 years (strong recommendation).<sup>45</sup> Generally, guidelines agree that screening should either be individualized in older adults aged 76 to 85 years (ACS, AAFP, and US Multi-Society Task Force) or stopped altogether (ACP), with clear consensus that screening should stop after age 85 years.</p>","discussion":"<h2>Supporting Evidence</h2><h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n<p>To update its 2016 recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a systematic review<sup>9,10</sup> to evaluate the benefits and harms of screening for colorectal cancer in adults 40 years or older. As in 2016, the USPSTF reviewed the evidence on (1) the effectiveness and comparative effectiveness of screening strategies to reduce colorectal cancer incidence, colorectal cancer mortality, or both; (2) the accuracy of various screening tests to detect colorectal cancer, advanced adenomas, or adenomatous polyps based on size; and (3) the serious harms of different screening tests. The review also examined whether these findings varied by age, sex, or race/ethnicity.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, as in 2016, the USPSTF commissioned a report from the CISNET Colorectal Cancer Working Group<sup>12,13</sup> to provide information from comparative modeling on how estimated life-years gained, colorectal cancer cases averted, and colorectal cancer deaths averted as well as colonoscopy burden and harms vary by different starting and stopping ages for various screening strategies. New analyses included in the current modeling for the USPSTF that were not performed in the models commissioned by the USPSTF in 2016 included analyses with elevated risk scenarios to reflect recent population trends in colorectal cancer incidence<sup>15</sup> and analyses by race.<sup>12,13</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF focused on reviewing evidence that reported accuracy of screening tests compared with colonoscopy as the reference standard. Colonoscopy accuracy is reported with a reference standard of either repeat colonoscopy or CT colonography&ndash;enhanced colonoscopy. The following accuracy results reflect accuracy after only a single application of the test rather than a program of repeated screenings.</p>\r\n<h4>Stool-Based Tests</h4>\r\n<p>Evidence on accuracy of high-sensitivity gFOBT to detect colorectal cancer and advanced adenomas compared with a colonoscopy reference standard was reported in 2 studies (n = 3503).<sup>9,10</sup> Reported sensitivity to detect colorectal cancer ranged from 0.50 to 0.75 (95% CI, 0.09-1.0) and reported specificity ranged from 0.96 to 0.98 (95% CI, 0.95-0.99). Sensitivity for detecting advanced adenomas was lower, ranging from 0.06 to 0.17 (95% CI, 0.02-0.23), while specificity was similar (0.96 to 0.99 [95% CI, 0.96-0.99]).<sup>9,10</sup> A larger evidence base was available on the accuracy of FIT<strong>,</strong> with the most evidence available on the OC-Sensor family of FITs (13 studies; n = 44,887).<sup>9,10</sup> Using the threshold recommended by the manufacturer (20 &mu;g hemoglobin per gram of stool), the pooled sensitivity for detection of colorectal cancer was 0.74 (95% CI, 0.64-0.83; 9 studies; n = 34,352) and pooled specificity was 0.94 (95% CI, 0.93-0.96; 9 studies; n = 34,352). Similar to high-sensitivity gFOBT, sensitivity for detecting advanced adenomas was lower while specificity was similar; pooled sensitivity was 0.23 (95% CI, 0.20-0.25) and pooled specificity was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.95-0.97).<sup>9,10</sup> Accuracy estimates of 9 other types of FIT were similar but were generally reported only in single studies. In 4 studies (n = 12,424) reporting the accuracy of sDNA-FIT,<sup>9,10</sup> pooled sensitivity for colorectal cancer detection was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.87-1.0) and pooled specificity was 0.84 (95% CI, 0.84-0.86), with a lower pooled sensitivity for detecting advanced adenomas (0.43 [95% CI, 0.40-0.46]) but higher pooled specificity (0.89 [95% CI, 0.86-0.92]).<sup>9,10</sup> Ten of the accuracy studies on FIT also reported results by age strata and generally found no significant difference; 2 reported stratified analyses for individuals younger than 50 years. Two studies suggested lower specificity for colorectal cancer detection in adults 70 years or older; a single study on sDNA-FIT suggested decreasing specificity with increasing age.<sup>9,10</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Direct Visualization Tests</h4>\r\n<p>Colonoscopy was evaluated in 4 studies (n = 4821) on accuracy, with 3 studies (n = 2290) determining missed cases of colorectal cancer by follow-up CT colonography&ndash;enhanced colonoscopy or CT colonography and repeat colonoscopy for discrepant findings.<sup>9</sup> In all 4 studies, sensitivity for detection of adenomas measuring 10 mm or larger ranged from 0.89 (95% CI, 0.78-0.96) to 0.95 (95% CI, 0.74-0.99); specificity was reported in a single study as 0.89 (95% CI, 0.86-0.91).<sup>9,10</sup> Two of the studies on colonoscopy accuracy included patients younger than 50 years, although results in this age group were not reported separately.</p>\r\n<p>Seven studies (n = 5328) reported on accuracy of CT colonography.<sup>9,10</sup> The studies were heterogeneous in study design, population, imaging technique, and reader experience or protocol. Sensitivity for colorectal cancer detection was reported in 6 of the studies and ranged from 0.86 to 1.0 (95% CI range, 0.21-1.0); specificity was not reported. Pooled sensitivity for detection of adenomas measuring 10 mm or larger was 0.89 (95% CI, 0.83-0.96) and pooled specificity was 0.94 (95% CI, 0.89-1.0). One study reported CT colonography accuracy by age and suggested that sensitivity was lower in adults 65 years or older; however, this finding was not statistically significant.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF did not identify any studies that reported on the accuracy of flexible sigmoidoscopy using colonoscopy as the reference standard.</p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>Direct evidence on the benefits of colorectal cancer screening to decrease colorectal cancer mortality are available from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) on gFOBT and flexible sigmoidoscopy as well as from cohort studies on FIT and colonoscopy. Pooled results from 4 RCTs (n = 458,002) on flexible sigmoidoscopy compared with no screening show a significant decrease in colorectal cancer mortality (mortality rate ratio, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.68-0.80]) over 11 to 17 years of follow-up.<sup>9,10</sup> Most studies reported outcomes after a single round of screening, although the 1 trial conducted in the US, the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial,<sup>38</sup> evaluated 2 rounds of screening. Decreased mortality with flexible sigmoidoscopy screening was consistently reported across the 4 trials. None of the trials included persons younger than 50 years.</p>\r\n<p>Trials that report on colorectal cancer outcomes with high-sensitivity gFOBT screening are currently lacking, although several older trials report decreased colorectal cancer mortality with Hemoccult II screening (an older gFOBT no longer commonly used). After 2 to 9 rounds of biennial gFOBT screening, colorectal cancer mortality was found to be lower at 11 to 30 years of follow-up (relative risk range, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.65-0.93] to 0.91 [95% CI, 0.84-0.98]). Participants younger than 50 years were included in 3 trials, although results for that age group were not reported separately.</p>\r\n<p>Two prospective cohort studies (n = 436,927) in US-based populations reported on colorectal cancer outcomes after colonoscopy screening.<sup>9,10</sup> One study among health professionals found that after 22 years of follow-up, colorectal mortality was lower in persons who reported receiving at least 1 colonoscopy (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.32 [95% CI, 0.24-0.45]),<sup>39</sup> although findings were no longer significant after 5 years for adults with a first-degree relative with colorectal cancer. This study included persons younger than 50 years, although results for this age group were not reported separately. Another cohort study among Medicare beneficiaries reported that the risk of colorectal cancer was significantly lower in adults aged 70 to 74 years (but not aged 75 to 79 years) 8 years after receiving a screening colonoscopy (standardized risk, 0.42% [95% CI, 0.24%-0.63%]).<sup>40</sup> One large, prospective cohort study (n = 5,417,699) from Taiwan reported on colorectal cancer mortality after introduction of a nationwide screening program with FIT in adults aged 50 to 69 years.<sup>41</sup> After 1 to 3 rounds of biennial FIT screening, lower colorectal cancer mortality was found at 6 years of follow-up (adjusted relative risk, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.84-0.95]).</p>\r\n<p>The CISNET modeling study commissioned for this review estimated the number of life-years gained, colorectal cancer cases and deaths averted, lifetime colonoscopies required (as a proxy measure for the burden of screening), and resulting harms from colonoscopy (ie, gastrointestinal and cardiovascular events) for various screening strategies. These strategies varied in the screening modality, the age at which to start and stop screening, and the frequency of screening.<sup>12,13</sup> The USPSTF focused on findings from models that assumed an elevated population risk of colorectal cancer. These models were thought to better capture the currently observed epidemiologic trend of increasing incidence in adults younger than 50 years, which is thought to reflect cohort effects, with younger birth cohorts at greater risk for colorectal cancer than older cohorts.<sup>12,13,15</sup> The USPSTF focused on estimated life-years gained (compared with no screening) as the primary measure of the benefit of screening. Given this elevated population risk assumption, as well as assuming 100% adherence, the USPSTF determined that beginning screening at age 45 years and continuing to the age of 75 years, for the following screening strategies, yielded a reasonable balance of benefits (life-years gained) and burdens or harms (number of colonoscopies): annual FIT, sDNA-FIT every 1 to 3 years, CT colonography or flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years, colonoscopy every 10 years, or flexible sigmoidoscopy every 10 years with annual FIT (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Modeling estimates that screening with sDNA-FIT annually results in additional colonoscopy burden compared with annual FIT screening (approximately 850 more subsequent follow-up and surveillance colonoscopies needed per 1000 adults screened with annual sDNA-FIT).<sup>12</sup> Screening with sDNA-FIT every 2 years is estimated to result in approximately 300 more subsequent follow-up and surveillance colonoscopies per 1000 adults screened compared with annual FIT. In modeling analyses, performing sDNA-FIT every 3 years or high-sensitivity gFOBT annually (also included in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) did not provide an efficient balance of the estimated lifetime number of colonoscopies vs the estimated life-years gained, compared with other options for stool-based screening. However, sDNA-FIT every 3 years or high-sensitivity gFOBT annually is still estimated to provide a reasonable balance of benefit in life-years gained and harms compared with no screening.<sup>12</sup> Additionally, there is greater uncertainty in the model predictions for high-sensitivity gFOBT strategies, given the underlying uncertainty around the sensitivity and specificity of high-sensitivity gFOBT to detect adenomas and colorectal cancer.<sup>9,12</sup></p>\r\n<p>Based on averaging estimates across the 3 CISNET models, if screening were performed from ages 45 to 75 years with one of the USPSTF recommended strategies, an estimated 286 to 337 life-years would be gained, an estimated 42 to 61 cases of colorectal cancer would be averted, and an estimated 24 to 28 colorectal cancer deaths would be averted, per 1000 adults screened, depending on the specific strategy used (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>).<sup>12</sup> This finding translates to an estimated 104 to 123 days of life gained per person screened. Lowering the starting age of screening from age 50 years to age 45 years results in an estimated additional 2 to 3 cases of colorectal cancer being averted, an estimated 1 additional colorectal cancer death averted, and an estimated 22 to 27 additional life-years gained per 1000 adults (ie, 8 to 10 additional days of life gained per person screened)<sup>12</sup> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>).</p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Screening and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>No studies reported on harms from stool-based tests.<sup>9,10</sup> The primary harms from stool-based screening tests are thought to come from false-positive and false-negative results and from harms of workup of positive screening results, such as colonoscopy. Serious harms from colonoscopy to follow-up positive screening results are estimated to be 17.5 serious bleeding events (95% CI, 7.6-27.5; 11 studies; n = 78,793) and 5.4 perforations (95% CI, 3.4 to 7.4; 12 studies; n = 341,922) per 10,000 colonoscopies.<sup>9,10</sup></p>\r\n<p>Harms from screening colonoscopy have been reported in 67 observational studies (n = 27,746,669).<sup>9</sup> Rates of serious bleeding events and perforations are lower with screening colonoscopy than with colonoscopy performed following positive stool-based screening test results (presumably because of fewer biopsies and adenoma removals), with 14.6 major bleeding events per 10,000 colonoscopies (95% CI, 9.4-19.9; 20 studies; n = 5,172,508) and 3.1 perforations per 10,000 colonoscopies (95% CI, 2.3-4.0; 26 studies; n = 5,272,600).<sup>9,10</sup> If sedation is used during colonoscopy, cardiopulmonary events may rarely occur, although the precise frequency of occurrence is not known. No higher risk of other serious harms with screening colonoscopy was seen in 4 cohort studies (n = 4,173,949). Other serious reported harms include infection and other gastrointestinal events (besides bleeding and perforation). Twenty-three studies reported on differences in harms by age, and 21 studies included persons younger than 50 years.<sup>9,10</sup> Overall findings indicated increasing risk of bleeding and perforation with increasing age. Bowel preparation for colonoscopy, flexible sigmoidoscopy, and CT colonography may lead to dehydration or electrolyte imbalances, particularly in older adults or persons with comorbid conditions; accurate estimates of the rates of these events are not available.</p>\r\n<p>Harms from flexible sigmoidoscopy were reported in 18 studies (n = 395,077).<sup>9,10</sup> Rates of serious harms were 0.5 bleeding events per 10,000 sigmoidoscopies (95% CI, 0-1.3; 10 studies; n = 179,854) and 0.2 perforations per 10,000 sigmoidoscopies (95% CI, 0.1-0.4; 11 studies; n = 359,679). No studies included persons younger than 50 years and no subgroup analyses on harms by age were reported. Rates of harms from colonoscopy following abnormal flexible sigmoidoscopy results include 20.7 major bleeding events per 10,000 colonoscopies (95% CI, 8.2-33.2; 4 studies; n = 5790) and 12.0 perforations per 10,000 colonoscopies (95% CI, 7.5-16.5; 4 studies; n = 23,022).<sup>9,10</sup></p>\r\n<p>Harms from CT colonography are uncommon (19 studies; n = 90,133), and the reported radiation dose for CT colonography ranges from 0.8 to 5.3 mSv (compared with an average annual background radiation dose of 3.0 mSv per person in the US).<sup>9,10</sup> Accurate estimates of rates of serious harms from colonoscopy following abnormal CT colonography results are not available. Extracolonic findings on CT colonography are common. Based on 27 studies that included 48,235 participants, 1.3% to 11.4% of examinations identified extracolonic findings that required workup.<sup>9,10</sup> Three percent or less of individuals with extracolonic findings required definitive medical or surgical treatment for an incidental finding. A few studies suggest that extracolonic findings may be more common in older age groups. Long-term clinical follow-up of extracolonic findings was reported in few studies, making it difficult to know whether it represents a benefit or harm of CT colonography.</p>\r\n<p>Potential harms of colorectal cancer screening include possible overdetection of adenomas not destined to become cancer; however, no studies directly assessing the health effects of these harms were identified.<sup>9,10</sup></p>\r\n<p>Based on the available empirical evidence,<sup>9,10</sup> harms from colonoscopy (either a screening colonoscopy, follow-up colonoscopy after a positive screening result from other methods, or surveillance colonoscopy in persons in whom adenomas have previously been detected) were considered to be the main source of colorectal cancer screening harms in the CISNET modeling study.<sup>12,13</sup> Thus, harms were quantified as the lifetime number of colonoscopy complications associated with screening, and the lifetime number of colonoscopies was used as a proxy for the burden of screening. Based on averaging estimates across the 3 models, if screening were performed from ages 45 to 75 years with 1 of the USPSTF recommended strategies, an estimated 1535 to 4248 colonoscopy procedures and 10 to 16 colonoscopy complications would be expected over the lifetime of 1000 screened adults (ie, 1.5 to 4.2 colonoscopies per person over the lifetime and complications estimated as occurring in 1 in every 63 to 102 adults screened from ages 45 to 75 years).<sup>12,13</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comments</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from October 27, 2020, to November 23, 2020. Many comments were received on the USPSTF&rsquo;s new B recommendation to screen adults aged 45 to 49 years; some supported the new recommendation, others requested that screening begin at an even younger age, and still others disagreed with starting screening before age 50 years. The USPSTF appreciates the various perspectives that were shared. Although future research could further strengthen the USPSTF&rsquo;s understanding about the benefits and harms of colorectal cancer screening in adults aged 45 to 49 years, based on the USPSTF&rsquo;s assessment of the available empirical, modeling, and epidemiologic data, the USPSTF finds adequate evidence that screening this age group provides a moderate net benefit. Several comments requested that colonoscopy to follow up an abnormal noncolonoscopy screening test result be considered part of screening. The USPSTF recognizes that the benefits of screening can only be fully achieved when follow-up of abnormal screening test results is performed. The USPSTF added language to the Practice Considerations section to clarify this.</p>\r\n<p>Several comments also requested clarification about how frequently sDNA-FIT is being recommended. The USPSTF has clarified that screening every 1 to 3 years with sDNA-FIT would be reasonable. Comments were also received requesting that the USPSTF provide a tiered or ranked list of screening strategies. Because no direct evidence compares different screening tests, and because local resources or patient factors may influence feasibility of different screening strategies, the USPSTF is unable to determine which tests are unequivocally &ldquo;better&rdquo; or &ldquo;worse.&rdquo; In <a href=\"#tab1\">Table 1</a>, the USPSTF describes the available empirical and modeling evidence on the benefits and harms of each screening strategy and also highlights additional considerations that may help an individual patient and clinician select a specific screening strategy. Comments also requested that persons with a personal or family history of Lynch syndrome be added to the recommendation. Persons who have hereditary cancer syndromes such as Lynch syndrome are at very high risk for colorectal cancer and may need screening strategies that go beyond the evidence that the USPSTF reviewed. Persons with a personal or family history of Lynch syndrome should speak with their health care professional about appropriate screening options.</p><h2>Figure 1.

The rate of chlamydia infection among women (698.9 cases per 100,000 women) was nearly double the rate among men (399.9 cases per 100,000 men). Gonorrhea infection was more prevalent in men (224.4 cases per 100,000 men) than in women (152.6 cases per 100,000 women). Infection rates are highest among adolescents and young adults of both sexes. In 2019 almost two-thirds (61.0%) of all reported chlamydia infections, and in 2018 more than half (54.1%) of new gonococcal infections, were among persons aged 15 to 24 years.<sup>1,2</sup></p>\r\n<p>Chlamydial and gonococcal infections in women are usually asymptomatic and may lead to pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and its associated complications, such as ectopic pregnancy, infertility, and chronic pelvic pain.<sup>3-5</sup> Newborns of pregnant persons with untreated infection may develop neonatal chlamydial pneumonia or gonococcal or chlamydial ophthalmia.<sup>6,7</sup> Infection in men may lead to urethritis and epididymitis.<sup>8-11</sup> Men are often asymptomatic; however, gonorrhea is more likely than chlamydia to cause symptoms in men than in women.<sup>12</sup> Both types of infection can increase risk of acquiring or transmitting HIV.<sup>13,14</sup></p><h2>USPSTF Assessment of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h2><p>The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) concludes with moderate certainty that screening for chlamydia in all sexually active women 24 years or younger and in women 25 years or older who are at increased risk for infection has <strong>moderate net benefit</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for gonorrhea in all sexually active women 24 years or younger and in women 25 years or older who are at increased risk for infection has <strong>moderate net benefit</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes that the current <strong>evidence is insufficient</strong> to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea in men.</p>\r\n<p>See the <a href=\"#table\">Table</a> for more information on the USPSTF recommendation rationale and assessment.

Persons should consider their sex at birth and current anatomy (especially presence of a cervix/vagina) and consult with their own clinician, if necessary, to determine which recommendation best applies to them.</p>\r\n<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>\r\n<p>Age is a strong predictor of risk for chlamydial and gonococcal infections, with the highest infection rates in women occurring during ages 15 to 24 years.<sup>1</sup> Women 25 years or older are at increased risk if they have a new sex partner, more than 1 sex partner, a sex partner with concurrent partners, or a sex partner who has an STI; practice inconsistent condom use when not in a mutually monogamous relationship; or have a previous or coexisting STI. Exchanging sex for money or drugs and history of incarceration also are associated with increased risk.<sup>16</sup> Clinicians should consider the communities they serve and may want to consult local public health authorities for information about local epidemiology and guidance on determining who is at increased risk.</p>\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) for <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em> and <em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em> infections are usually used for screening because their sensitivity and specificity are high for detecting these infections.<sup>17</sup> The US Food and Drug Administration approves NAATs for use on urogenital and extragenital sites, including urine, endocervical, vaginal, male urethral, rectal, and pharyngeal specimens.<sup>17,18</sup> Urine testing with NAATs is at least as sensitive as testing with endocervical specimens, clinician- or self-collected vaginal specimens, or urethral specimens in clinical settings. The same specimen can be used to test for chlamydia and gonorrhea.<sup>19</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Screening Intervals</h3>\r\n<p>In the absence of studies on screening intervals, a reasonable approach would be to screen patients whose sexual history reveals new or persistent risk factors since the last negative test result.</p>\r\n<h3>Treatment or Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>Chlamydial and gonococcal infections respond to treatment with antibiotics. Because treatment varies depending on the individual patient, and antibiotic resistance for gonorrhea is increasing, clinicians are encouraged to consult the most up-to-date guidance on treatment from the CDC.<sup>16,20</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Implementation</h3>\r\n<p>Although the prevalences of chlamydia and gonorrhea differ, the risk factors for infection overlap, and the USPSTF recommends screening for both simultaneously. The USPSTF did not review evidence on screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea in persons living with HIV or taking HIV preexposure prophylaxis. The CDC provides recommendations for these and other specific groups. The CDC also describes ways to increase adherence to treatment and interventions to decrease the likelihood of reinfection.<sup>16,20,21</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Other Related USPSTF Recommendations</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF has issued recommendations on screening for other STIs, including hepatitis B,<sup>22,23</sup> hepatitis C,<sup>24</sup> genital herpes,<sup>25</sup> HIV,<sup>26,27</sup> and syphilis.<sup>28,29</sup> The USPSTF has also issued recommendations on behavioral counseling for all sexually active adolescents and for adults who are at increased risk for STIs.<sup>30</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Additional Tools and Resources</h3>\r\n<p>The CDC provides more information about STIs, including chlamydia and gonorrhea, at <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/std/default.htm\">https://www.cdc.gov/std/default.htm</a>, as well as guidance for clinicians on providing quality STI clinical services, at <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/rr/rr6805a1.htm\">https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/rr/rr6805a1.htm</a>.</p>\r\n<p>The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine provides a comprehensive systems-based approach for prevention and control of STIs at <a href=\"https://www.nap.edu/catalog/25955/sexually-transmitted-infections-adopting-a-sexual-health-paradigm\">https://www.nap.edu/catalog/25955/sexually-transmitted-infections-adopting-a-sexual-health-paradigm</a>.</p>\r\n<p>The Community Preventive Services Task Force has issued several recommendations on the prevention of HIV/AIDS, other STIs, and teen pregnancy. The Community Guide discusses interventions that have been efficacious in school settings, and for men who have sex with men, at <a href=\"https://www.thecommunityguide.org/topic/hiv-stis-and-teen-pregnancy\">https://www.thecommunityguide.org/topic/hiv-stis-and-teen-pregnancy</a>.</p>\r\n<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada guidelines on STIs are available at <a href=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/infectious-diseases/sexual-health-sexually-transmitted-infections/canadian-guidelines/sexually-transmitted-infections.html\">https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/infectious-diseases/sexual-health-sexually-transmitted-infections/canadian-guidelines/sexually-transmitted-infections.html</a>.</p>\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>\r\n<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>\r\n<p>Chlamydial and gonococcal infections are often asymptomatic in men but may result in urethritis, epididymitis, and proctitis. Uncommon complications include reactive arthritis (chlamydia) and disseminated gonococcal infection.<sup>16</sup> Urogenital positivity among men who have sex with men was 6% for chlamydia and 7% for gonorrhea across 11 Sexually Transmitted Disease Surveillance Network jurisdictions in 2019.<sup>1</sup> Infections at extragenital sites (such as the pharynx and rectum) are typically asymptomatic. Chlamydial and gonococcal infections may increase risk of acquiring or transmitting HIV.<sup>13,14</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Potential Harms</h4>\r\n<p>Potential harms of screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea include false-positive or false-negative results as well as labeling and anxiety associated with positive results.</p>\r\n<h4>Current Practice</h4>\r\n<p>A review of health care claims of 4296 male and female patients presenting for general medical or gynecologic examinations from 2000 to 2003 found that a large proportion of patients with high-risk sexual behaviors did not receive STI or HIV testing during their visit.<sup>31</sup> According to a review of diagnostic billing codes for 1074 patients with high-risk sexual behaviors, men were significantly less likely than women to be tested for chlamydia (20.7% vs 56.9%) and gonorrhea (20.7% vs 50.9%), although they were more likely to be tested for HIV (79.3% vs 38.8%) and syphilis (39.1% vs 27.6%).<sup>31</sup></p><h2>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h2><p>This recommendation updates the USPSTF's 2014 recommendation on screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea.</p>\r\n<p>In 2014, the USPSTF recommended screening for chlamydia in sexually active women 24 years or younger and in women 25 years or older who are at increased risk for infection. It also recommended screening for gonorrhea in sexually active women 24 years or younger and in women 25 years or older who are at increased risk for infection. Both recommendations included pregnant persons. The USPSTF found insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea in men.</p>","other":"<h2>Supporting Evidence</h2><h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF commissioned a systematic review<sup>19,32</sup> to update its recommendation on screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea. The review evaluated the benefits and harms of screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea in all sexually active adolescents and adults, including pregnant persons. Key differences between the current review and the prior review are that the current review combined all populations, including pregnant persons, into a single analytic framework; evaluated the accuracy of risk stratification and screening strategies for identifying persons at increased risk; and focused evaluation of diagnostic accuracy on anatomical site&ndash;specific testing.<sup>19,32,33</sup> Because the USPSTF had previously determined that treatments for these infections are effective and well established, this review did not include a review of treatments.<sup>19,32</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening Tests and Risk Assessment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found convincing evidence that clinicians could identify sexually active women at increased risk for chlamydial and gonococcal infections. It found adequate evidence that clinicians could identify sexually active men at increased risk for chlamydial and gonococcal infections. Seven new fair-quality studies with more than 93,000 participants were included in the analysis.<sup>34-39</sup> In asymptomatic individuals, 3 studies with 71,636 participants that used a risk score to identify persons with chlamydial or gonococcal infections reported an area under the curve of 0.64 to 0.73.<sup>34-36</sup> One study showed that age (younger than 22 years) alone had accuracy similar to that for the use of more extensive risk criteria.<sup>39</sup></p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found convincing evidence that available screening tests can accurately diagnose chlamydial and gonococcal infections in both women and men. Nine fair-quality studies in more than 16,000 participants indicated that screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea with NAATs is highly accurate for specimens from various anatomical sites and different collection methods for women and men.<sup>40-48</sup> Sensitivity of NAAT specimens collected from urogenital sites for detecting chlamydia and gonorrhea in women ranged from 72% to 100%, excluding 1 outlier study. Sensitivity among collection methods, including vaginal clinician- or self-collection or urine collection, varied little. NAATs for chlamydia and gonorrhea screening in men was highly accurate, with sensitivities ranging from 89% to 100% for urethral, meatal, and urine testing. NAATs were also highly sensitive for detecting rectal and pharyngeal gonorrhea and rectal chlamydia in men (89% to 93%); they had moderate sensitivity (69%) for detecting pharyngeal chlamydia in men. Specificity for several sites was high, ranging from 90% to 100% for both infections in men and women. Specificity was not reported for gonorrhea in women at the urethral site and in men at the urethral, rectal, or pharyngeal sites.<sup>19</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed 4 trials and concluded that screening was associated with reduced risk of PID vs no screening.<sup>49-52</sup> One recent large, good-quality trial of men and women (n = 63,338) in primary care clinics found that screening for chlamydia was associated with a reduction in risk of hospital-diagnosed PID compared with usual care (relative risk, 0.6 [95% CI, 0.4-1.0]), but the absolute difference was small (0.24% vs 0.38%). No differences were seen in rates of PID or epididymitis in clinics.<sup>52</sup> No studies reported the association between screening and disease acquisition or transmission or between screening and clinical outcomes other than PID or epididymitis.<sup>19</sup></p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF previously found fair-quality evidence that treatment of chlamydial infection during pregnancy is associated with improved outcomes for infants and mothers.<sup>53,54</sup> The USPSTF reviewed large cohort studies of screening at the first prenatal visit in pregnant women (with a total of 11,544 participants) at increased risk for infection. These studies found that treatment of chlamydial infection was associated with significantly lower rates of preterm delivery, early rupture of membranes, and infants with low birth weight compared with no treatment or treatment failure.<sup>53,54</sup> No subsequent studies met inclusion criteria for the current USPSTF review.<sup>19,32</sup></p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found little direct evidence on the effectiveness of screening for chlamydia in men or low-risk women in reducing infection complications or disease transmission or acquisition. It found that the overall prevalence of chlamydial infection in the general population varies widely depending on age and other risk factors. Chlamydial infection may cause urethritis and epididymitis in men, but serious complications are not common. Screening and treating young men at increased risk may reduce the incidence of chlamydial infection; however, the USPSTF found very limited published randomized trials or observational studies of the effect of routine screening in men or comparison with the strategy of screening women and treating their male partners.<sup>19,32</sup> The USPSTF found no studies on the benefits of screening women, including pregnant women, who are not at increased risk for infection.<sup>19,32</sup></p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no studies that directly evaluated the effectiveness of screening for gonorrhea in its current or previous reviews.<sup>19,32,33</sup> It previously found indirect evidence of the benefits of early detection and treatment in women at increased risk based on the substantial prevalence of asymptomatic infection, the availability of accurate screening tests and effective treatments, and the high morbidity associated with untreated infection in women.<sup>55</sup> Gonococcal infections in women are frequently asymptomatic but represent an important reservoir of infection that could lead to reproductive complications and life-threatening conditions.</p>\r\n<p>Based on indirect evidence, early detection and treatment of gonorrhea in pregnant women at increased risk for infection may decrease morbidity from infection-related obstetric complications. In women not at increased risk for gonorrhea, there is a low prevalence of infection, and universal ocular prophylaxis in newborns is effective and well established. Accordingly, the USPSTF concluded that the net benefit of screening for gonorrhea in pregnant women who are not at increased risk for infection is small.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found little evidence on the effectiveness of screening for gonorrhea in men or low-risk women. Prevalence in these groups is low.<sup>1</sup> Moreover, the majority of genital gonococcal infections in men are symptomatic, which can result in more timely clinical presentation and lead to diagnosis and treatment that prevents serious complications.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no studies comparing the effectiveness of cotesting for concurrent STIs or using different screening intervals.<sup>19,32</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Screening and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed several studies, including 4 recent studies (n = 5666), assessing harms of site-specific chlamydia and gonorrhea testing as well as harms of collection methods in women. The false- positive, false-negative, false alarm, and false reassurance rates varied by anatomical site but were overall generally low across all NAATs and specimen types.<sup>19,32</sup></p>\r\n<p>No studies of psychosocial harms, such as anxiety, related to testing met inclusion criteria for this or prior reviews.<sup>19,32</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from March 2 through March 29, 2021. Several comments expressed concern that the USPSTF found insufficient evidence to screen men and did not provide separate recommendations for specific high-risk populations. The USPSTF did not identify enough evidence to support that screening men for chlamydia and gonorrhea improves health outcomes by reducing infection complications or disease transmission or acquisition, including HIV. In the Research Needs and Gaps section, the USPSTF calls for more research on screening in men and other groups such as men who have sex with men; the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning (LGBTQ+) community; and racial and ethnic minorities. The USPSTF also clarified to whom the recommendation applies regarding sex and gender in the Practice Considerations section. Some comments requested that universal, rather than risk-based, screening be recommended for women 25 years or older. Based on available disease prevalence data and accuracy of risk assessment tools, the USPSTF found that younger age was a strong predictor of disease risk, which was clarified in the Practice Considerations section. Comments also asked for clarification on screening intervals. Given the lack of available evidence on optimal screening frequency, the USPSTF provides a reasonable approach for rescreening in the Practice Considerations section.</p>\r\n<h3>How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?</h3>\r\n<p>Chlamydial and gonococcal infections are often asymptomatic in women. Untreated infections may progress to PID-related complications such as chronic pelvic pain, ectopic pregnancy, or infertility. Infections may also be transmitted to sex partners and newborn children. Accurate screening tests and effective antibiotic treatments are available for chlamydia and gonorrhea.</p>\r\n<p>In men, gonococcal infections are more commonly symptomatic compared with women. Serious complications from infection are less common in men.</p><h2>Research Needs and Gaps</h2><p>Studies on assessing risk and for whom screening may be most effective are a high priority.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Studies evaluating the effectiveness of screening asymptomatic men to reduce infection complications and transmission or acquisition of either disease or HIV are needed.</li>\r\n<li>Studies are needed to better understand the benefits and harms of screening specific populations at risk such as men who have sex with men, members of the LGBTQ+ community, and persons with nonbinary gender identity.</li>\r\n<li>Prevalence of chlamydia and gonorrhea is high among American Indian/Alaska Native, Black, Hispanic/Latino, and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander persons. Studies providing information on differential access and effective prevention strategies for these populations may help reduce racial and ethnic disparities.</li>\r\n<li>Studies with direct evidence on the effectiveness of screening pregnant persons, testing extragenital sites, cotesting for concurrent STIs, and screening intervals would help provide more information for best practices.</li>\r\n</ul><h2>Recommendations of Others</h2><p>The CDC recommends annual chlamydia and gonorrhea testing in all sexually active women younger than 25 years and in older women at increased risk of infection (ie, those who have a new or multiple sex partners or a sex partner who has an STI). It also recommends screening for both infections in pregnant women younger than 25 years and in older pregnant women at increased risk for infection during their first prenatal visit and again during their third trimester if risk remains high.<sup>16</sup></p>\r\n<p>The CDC recommends that clinicians consider screening for chlamydia in sexually active young men in high-prevalence areas and populations. It recommends annual screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea at appropriate anatomical sites of exposure in men who have sex with men, with more frequent screening if risk behaviors persist or if they or their sex partners have multiple partners. The CDC recommends screening transgender individuals on the basis of their sexual practices and anatomy. Because of high rates of STIs in persons entering correctional facilities, the CDC recommends chlamydia and gonorrhea screening at intake in correctional facilities in women 35 years or younger and in men younger than 30 years. Because of the high likelihood of reinfection, the CDC recommends retesting all patients diagnosed with chlamydial or gonococcal infections 3 months after treatment, regardless of whether they believe their partners have been treated.<sup>16</sup></p>\r\n<p>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists follows the CDC&rsquo;s recommendations for annual chlamydia and gonorrhea screening in all sexually active women younger than 25 years and in older women with risk factors. However, it recommends that all pregnant women be tested for chlamydia early in pregnancy, with a repeat test in the third trimester for women with risk factors. It recommends testing for gonorrhea in pregnant women 25 years or younger or for those living in an area where gonorrhea is common.<sup>56,57</sup></p>\r\n<p>The American Academy of Family Physicians follows the 2014 USPSTF chlamydia and gonorrhea screening recommendations.<sup>58</sup> The American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations align with the CDC guidelines.<sup>59</sup></p>","topic":"Chlamydia and Gonorrhea: Screening","keywords":"Screening for Chlamydial and Gonococcal Infections|Chlamydia|Gonorrhea|Gonorrhea screening|sexually transmitted infections","pubDate":"2021-09-14","categories":["11"],"tool":["344","352","351","350","349","348","347","346","345"]},"445":{"topicType":"Screening","topicYear":2021,"uspstfAlias":"gestational-diabetes-screening","specific":[1932,1933],"title":"Gestational Diabetes: Screening","rationale":"<h2>Importance</h2><p>Gestational diabetes is diabetes that develops during pregnancy.<sup>1-3</sup> Prevalence of gestational diabetes in the US has been estimated at 5.8% to 9.2%, based on traditional diagnostic criteria, although it may be higher if more inclusive criteria are used.<sup>4-8</sup> Pregnant persons with gestational diabetes are at increased risk for maternal and fetal complications, including preeclampsia, fetal macrosomia (which can cause shoulder dystocia and birth injury), and neonatal hypoglycemia.<sup>3,9-11</sup> Gestational diabetes has also been associated with an increased risk of several long-term health outcomes in pregnant persons and intermediate outcomes in their offspring.<sup>12-16</sup></p><h2>USPSTF Assessment of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h2><h3>Pregnant Persons at 24 Weeks of Gestation or After</h3>\r\n<p>The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) concludes with moderate certainty that there is a <strong>moderate net benefit</strong> to screening for gestational diabetes at 24 weeks of gestation or after to improve maternal and fetal outcomes.</p>\r\n<h3>Pregnant Persons Before 24 Weeks of Gestation</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes that the evidence on screening for gestational diabetes before 24 weeks of gestation is insufficient, and the balance of benefits and harms of screening <strong>cannot be determined</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>See <a href=\"#tab1\">Table 1</a> for more information on the USPSTF recommendation rationale and assessment.

In the past, gestational diabetes was defined as glucose intolerance discovered during pregnancy; however, this definition does not distinguish between persons with glucose intolerance related to pregnancy and those with preexisting, overt diabetes that was previously undiagnosed.<sup>18</sup> Because of this, several organizations, such as the American Diabetes Association, have updated the definition to specify gestational diabetes as diabetes that develops during pregnancy that is not clearly overt diabetes that developed prior to pregnancy.<sup>2,3</sup> Screening for and treatment of undiagnosed type 2 diabetes in pregnant persons is not part of this recommendation.</p>\r\n<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>\r\n<p>Several factors increase a person&rsquo;s risk for developing gestational diabetes, including obesity, increased maternal age, history of gestational diabetes, family history of diabetes, and belonging to a racial/ethnic group that is at increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes (Hispanic, Native American, South or East Asian, or Pacific Island descent).<sup>4,19,20</sup> Factors associated with a lower risk for developing gestational diabetes include age younger than 25 to 30 years, White race, a body mass index (BMI) of 25 or less (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared), no family history (in a first-degree relative) of diabetes, and no history of glucose intolerance or adverse pregnancy outcomes related to gestational diabetes.<sup>21-23</sup> The risk in different racial/ethnic groups may be due in part to social risk factors such as low socioeconomic status or structural racism, although these associations are not examined in the current evidence. Although a higher BMI increases the risk of gestational diabetes across racial/ethnic groups, the association varies. In Asian American persons, the prevalence of gestational diabetes at a BMI of 22 to less than 25 is similar to the prevalence in Hispanic persons, non-Hispanic White persons, and Black persons with a higher (&gt;28) BMI.<sup>24,25</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>Screening for gestational diabetes in asymptomatic persons involves either a 2-step (screening test followed by a diagnostic test) or 1-step (diagnostic test used for all patients) approach. In the US, a 2-step approach is commonly used.<sup>8,26</sup> A 50-g oral glucose challenge test (OGCT) is performed between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation in a nonfasting state. If the screening threshold is met or exceeded, patients receive the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). During the OGTT, a fasting glucose level is obtained, followed by administration of a 75-g or 100-g glucose load, then evaluation of glucose levels after 1, 2, and often 3 hours. A diagnosis of gestational diabetes is made when 2 or more glucose values fall at or above the specified glucose thresholds.<sup>27</sup></p>\r\n<p>In the 1-step approach, a 75-g glucose load is administered after a fasting glucose level is obtained, and plasma glucose levels are evaluated after 1 and 2 hours. A diagnosis of gestational diabetes is made when 1 or more glucose values fall at or above the specified glucose thresholds.<sup>28</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Screening Intervals</h3>\r\n<p>There are limited data on the benefits and harms of screening before 24 weeks of gestation. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends testing between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation.<sup>1</sup> Pregnant persons whose first prenatal visit happens after 28 weeks of gestation (ie, late entry into prenatal care) should be screened as soon as possible.</p>\r\n<h3>Treatment and Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>Initial treatment generally includes moderate physical activity, dietary changes, support from diabetes educators and nutritionists, and glucose monitoring. If the patient&rsquo;s glucose is not controlled after these initial interventions, clinicians often prescribe medications (either insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents), perform increased surveillance in prenatal care, adopt changes in delivery management, or some combination thereof.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>\r\n<p>In deciding whether to screen for gestational diabetes before 24 weeks of gestation, primary care clinicians may consider the following.</p>\r\n<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>\r\n<p>Between 2006 and 2016, there was an absolute increase of 3.6% in the prevalence of gestational diabetes.<sup>7</sup> Pregnant persons with gestational diabetes are at increased risk for maternal and fetal complications and may benefit from early identification and treatment. They are also at increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes after pregnancy.<sup>29</sup> Pregnant persons who are diagnosed with gestational diabetes before 24 weeks of gestation may be at even greater risk for maternal and fetal complications.<sup>29</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Potential Harms</h4>\r\n<p>Potential harms of screening for gestational diabetes include psychological harms (anxiety, depression), intensive medical interventions (induction of labor, cesarean delivery, or admission to the neonatal intensive care unit [NICU]), and negative hospital experiences related to labeling (reduction in breastfeeding and fewer newborns staying in the mother&rsquo;s room) that may be associated with a diagnosis of gestational diabetes. Possible adverse effects of treatment include neonatal or maternal hypoglycemia, increased risk of small for gestational age infants, and maternal stress.</p>\r\n<h4>Current Practice</h4>\r\n<p>Although current data are limited, a 2014-2015 survey found that universal screening is the most common practice in the US, with 90% of obstetricians reporting routinely screening for gestational diabetes using a 2-step approach.<sup>26</sup> Other potential (although not widely used) approaches to screening include fasting plasma glucose level, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) concentration, and risk-based screening tools. Some pregnant persons are screened earlier than 24 weeks of gestation because they have risk factors for type 2 diabetes, such as obesity, family history of type 2 diabetes, or fetal macrosomia during a previous pregnancy. If a pregnant person presents in the first trimester or in early pregnancy with risk factors for type 2 diabetes, clinicians should use their clinical judgment to determine what is appropriate screening for that individual patient, given the patient&rsquo;s health needs.</p>\r\n<h3>Other Related USPSTF Recommendations</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF has several recommendations related to pregnancy and the prevention of gestational diabetes. This includes recommendations on screening for abnormal blood glucose levels and type 2 diabetes (B recommendation),<sup>30</sup> behavioral weight loss interventions to prevent obesity-related morbidity and mortality in adults (B recommendation),<sup>31</sup> and behavioral counseling interventions for healthy weight and weight gain during pregnancy (B recommendation).<sup>32</sup></p><h2>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h2><p>In 2014, the USPSTF issued a B recommendation for screening for gestational diabetes after 24 weeks of gestation and an I statement for screening before 24 weeks of gestation.<sup>33</sup> This recommendation concurs with the B recommendation for screening for gestational diabetes after 24 weeks of gestation and the I statement for screening before 24 weeks of gestation.</p>","other":"<h2>Supporting Evidence</h2><h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n<p>To update the 2014 recommendation,<sup>33</sup> the USPSTF commissioned a systematic review to evaluate the accuracy, benefits, and harms of screening for gestational diabetes and the benefits and harms of treatment for the pregnant person and infant.<sup>29,34</sup> Pregestational diabetes (undiagnosed type 2 diabetes) is not in the scope of this recommendation.</p>\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening Tests and Risk Assessment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed 45 prospective studies of fair or good quality that assessed the accuracy of various screening tests for gestational diabetes, including the 50-g OGCT, fasting plasma glucose level, HbA<sub>1c</sub> concentration, and screening based on risk factors. The reference standard in these studies was the diagnostic OGTT, but the cutoff thresholds used for gestational diabetes varied, with most using criteria from Carpenter and Coustan, the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Group (IADPSG), and the National Diabetes Data Group (NDDG) (<a href=\"#tab2\">Table 2</a>). In all studies, the entire study population that had a screening test (regardless of test result) was offered the diagnostic OGTT reference standard. The studies were from a range of populations and settings, and the prevalence of gestational diabetes varied from 3.3% to 33%. Data on screening for gestational diabetes before 24 weeks of gestation were limited.<sup>29,34</sup></p>\r\n<p>Eight studies evaluated the accuracy of a 1-hour 50-g OGCT using a cutoff of 140 mg/dL (7.77 mmol/L) or lower. Gestational diabetes was confirmed by a 100-g 3-hour OGTT using either Carpenter and Coustan (8 studies), NDDG (6 studies), or IADPSG (2 studies) criteria. The 50-g OGCT showed good accuracy (sensitivity, 100%-75%; specificity, 86%-25%) using Carpenter and Coustan criteria and NDDG criteria, with lower thresholds showing greater sensitivity but lower or imprecise specificity.<sup>29,34</sup></p>\r\n<p>The accuracy of fasting plasma glucose level (using various cutoffs) was evaluated against Carpenter and Coustan (7 studies), IADPSG (9 studies), and NDDG (1 study) diagnostic criteria. For screening using fasting plasma glucose level at 24 weeks of gestation or after, an 85-mg/dL (4.72 mmol/L) or 90-mg/dL (5 mmol/L) cutoff had reasonable accuracy for a diagnosis using Carpenter and Coustan criteria, as did a 90-mg/dL cutoff using IADPSG criteria; values at 80 mg/dL (4.44 mg/dL) or lower appeared useful to rule out gestational diabetes using both criteria.<sup>29,34</sup> Two studies evaluated data for fasting plasma glucose level measured before 24 weeks of gestation; however, findings were inconsistent.<sup>29,34</sup></p>\r\n<p>Eighteen studies compared HbA1c screening (using various cutoffs) with Carpenter and Coustan , NDDG, or IADPSG diagnostic criteria. Overall, HbA1c concentration was not associated with high sensitivity and specificity at any threshold. Risk-based tools (some in combination with fasting plasma glucose level) were evaluated against Carpenter and Coustan criteria, NDDG criteria, or IADPSG diagnostic criteria, each in a single study. Overall, these tools may have high enough sensitivity to rule out gestational diabetes (and allow some pregnant persons to avoid the OGCT); however, their specificity was low.<sup>29,34</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<h4>Screening</h4>\r\n<p>No randomized clinical trials (RCTs) addressed the direct benefits or harms of screening for gestational diabetes. Four observational studies (1 case-control, 3 retrospective cohort studies) compared screening vs no screening, but results were mixed. Of these, 2 studies included in the previous review found no benefit, and the 2 newer studies (1 study with risk-based and 1 study with universal screening strategies) found benefits in outcomes such as full-term stillbirth and reduced risk of cesarean delivery, birth injuries, and NICU admissions. However, the small number of studies, lack of consistency in effect between the studies, and the use of observational designs (which are susceptible to biases) limit findings.<sup>29,34</sup></p>\r\n<p>Five RCTs of good or fair quality compared the effectiveness of different screening strategies on health outcomes. Only 1 of these trials evaluated screening before 24 weeks of gestation. Five trials (n = 25,772) compared IADPSG and Carpenter and Coustan screening criteria. Compared with Carpenter and Coustan criteria, screening with IADPSG criteria identified more cases of gestational diabetes. One- vs 2-step screening was not associated with differences in many pregnancy or fetal/neonatal outcomes, including preeclampsia/gestational hypertension, preterm delivery, large for gestational age (LGA) infant, birth injury, neonatal hypoglycemia, or perinatal mortality.<sup>29,34</sup> One study comparing IADSPG criteria with World Health Organization 1999 criteria (n = 502) found no difference in primary cesarean delivery and preterm delivery and imprecise findings for other maternal and fetal outcomes (ie, hypertensive disorders, shoulder dystocia). One study (n = 922) that enrolled women with obesity compared early screening (14 to 20 weeks of gestation) with usual timed screening (24 to 28 weeks of gestation) using Carpenter and Coustan criteria. Earlier screening was associated with an increased risk of preeclampsia, although the finding was not statistically significant. No other differences were found among other maternal or fetal/neonatal outcomes.<sup>29,34</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Treatment</h4>\r\n<p>Thirteen trials (11 RCTs and 2 nonrandomized clinical trials; n = 4235) examined the effectiveness of gestational diabetes treatment on intermediate and health outcomes. The studies used a variety of glucose-level inclusion criteria and assessed short- and long-term outcomes in the mother and infant. Interventions included both dietary and medical therapies. Treatment was started after 24 weeks of gestation in 9 trials (n = 3982), although in 2 of these trials, treatment was started earlier in pregnant persons who were determined to be at high or higher risk and screened earlier. The 3 RCTs that contributed most of the data used 2-step approaches for identifying gestational diabetes before enrollment. Four trials (n = 253) included women treated before 15 weeks of gestation. Race/ethnicity was fairly diverse in several studies, although 2 of the largest studies with treatment at 24 weeks of gestation or after enrolled large proportions of White (75%) and Chinese (97%) persons.<sup>29,34,37,38</sup></p>\r\n<p>Treatment of gestational diabetes at 24 weeks of gestation or after was associated with decreased risk of primary cesarean deliveries (relative risk [RR], 0.70 [95% CI, 0.54-0.91]; absolute risk difference [ARD], 5.3%; 3 trials) and preterm deliveries, although findings for the latter are not statistically significant (RR, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.56-1.01]; ARD, 2.3%; 4 trials).<sup>29,34</sup> Treatment of gestational diabetes was not associated with reduced risk of preeclampsia in the included studies (RR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.46-2.16]; 6 trials).<sup>29</sup> Additionally, treatment was not associated with reduced risk of gestational hypertension (2 trials), total cesarean deliveries (8 trials), emergency cesarean deliveries (1 trial), induction of labor (5 trials), or maternal birth trauma (2 trials).<sup>29,34</sup></p>\r\n<p>For fetal/neonatal outcomes, treatment of gestational diabetes at 24 weeks of gestation or after was associated with reduced risk of shoulder dystocia (RR, 0.42 [95% CI, 0.23-0.77]; ARD, 1.3%; 3 trials), macrosomia (RR, 0.53 [95% CI, 0.41-0.68]; ARD, 8.9%; 8 trials), LGA infants (RR, 0.56 [95% CI, 0.47-0.66]; ARD, 8.4%; 7 trials), birth injury (eg, fracture or nerve palsies) (odds ratio, 0.33 [95% CI, 0.11-0.99]; ARD, 0.2%), and NICU admissions (RR, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.53-0.99]; ARD, 2%; 5 trials).<sup>29,34</sup> No association was found for several outcomes, including mortality (stillbirth, neonatal, or perinatal), respiratory distress syndrome, hypoglycemia (any or clinical), and hyperbilirubinemia. There were no observed differences for several outcomes in 1 RCT based on timing of diagnosis, glycemic severity, or Hispanic ethnicity (vs non-Hispanic White).</p>\r\n<p>Few trials examined longer-term maternal or childhood outcomes. One trial found no association between treatment of gestational diabetes and impaired fasting glucose, obesity, the metabolic syndrome, or type 2 diabetes at 5 to 10 years. No study measured the effects of treatment of gestational diabetes on quality of life, cardiovascular outcomes, or mortality or major morbidity from type 2 diabetes.<sup>29,34</sup> For long-term intermediate and health outcomes in children, treatment of gestational diabetes in mothers vs no treatment was not associated with reduced risk of overweight (over 4-10 years), obesity (over 5-11 years), impaired glucose tolerance (at 9 years), or impaired fasting glucose (over 5-11 years). No study measured cardiovascular or neurocognitive outcomes.<sup>29,34</sup> All findings from the 4 small trials of early treatment were imprecise, with wide confidence intervals for point estimates.</p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Screening and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>Seven observational studies (n = 166,082) looked at harms associated with screening for gestational diabetes. Three studies provided data on potential psychosocial harms (ie, anxiety, depressive symptoms, or both) from screening, receipt of a positive diagnostic test result, or receipt of a false-positive test result. Three large studies examined hospital experiences related to breastfeeding outcomes in pregnant persons with gestational diabetes, and 1 study examined the likelihood of cesarean delivery as a result of a gestational diabetes diagnosis. There was no increase in anxiety/depression with screening or receiving a false-positive test result and a small, transient increase in anxiety associated with gestational diabetes diagnosis. Diagnosis of gestational diabetes may be associated with lower rates of breastfeeding in the first hour after birth and exclusive breastfeeding in the hospital, and with fewer newborns staying in the mother&rsquo;s room, although confounding factors (eg, breastfeeding intentions, varying hospital policies, and treatment effects) could have affected findings. One study found that gestational diabetes diagnosis and labeling may be associated with higher rates of cesarean delivery.<sup>29,34</sup></p>\r\n<p>Harms associated with the treatment of gestational diabetes were evaluated in 13 trials (11 RCTs and 2 nonrandomized clinical trials; n = 4235).<sup>29,34</sup> Treatment at 24 weeks of gestation or after was not associated with an increased risk for severe maternal hypoglycemia, low birth weight, or small for gestational age infants. There was no observed difference of small for gestational age infants based on race/ethnicity or glycemic status. Treatment of gestational diabetes was associated with a reduced risk of macrosomia (&gt;4000 g) (RR, 0.53 [95% CI, 0.41 to 0.68]) but no difference in the risk of total number of cesarean deliveries (RR, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.83 to 1.08]).<sup>29,34</sup> This suggests that a small proportion of pregnant persons may undergo cesarean delivery because of gestational diabetes diagnosis alone.</p>\r\n<h3>How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?</h3>\r\n<p>Gestational diabetes usually occurs after 20 weeks of gestation, when placental hormones with the opposite effect of insulin increase substantially. Pregnant persons with adequate insulin secreting capacity can overcome this insulin resistance of pregnancy by secreting more insulin to maintain normal blood glucose levels. Pregnant persons who are unable to produce adequate insulin to overcome the increase in insulin resistance seen in pregnancy develop glucose intolerance and gestational diabetes.</p>\r\n<p>Screening for gestational diabetes is generally recommended between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation. Pregnant persons with gestational diabetes are at increased risk for maternal and infant complications. Screening for and detecting gestational diabetes provides a potential opportunity to control blood glucose levels (through lifestyle changes, pharmacological interventions, or both) and reduce the risk of macrosomia and LGA infants. In turn, this can prevent associated complications such as primary cesarean delivery, shoulder dystocia, and NICU admissions.</p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from February 16 through March 15, 2021. Several comments requested that the recommendation include guidance on which screening test should be used. The USPSTF found that several screening tests (OGCT, OGTT, fasting plasma glucose) and strategies (1- vs 2-step approach) can accurately detect gestational diabetes and does not recommend any single specific test. Based on newer evidence, the USPSTF found no difference between a 1-step and 2-step screening strategy for many maternal or infant outcomes. Comments requested that the USPSTF recommend screening only pregnant persons at increased risk for gestational diabetes to try and minimize false-positive test results and unnecessary labeling of lower-risk patients. The USPSTF found limited data on risk-based screening strategies.</p>\r\n<p>Several comments discussed the potential benefit of screening before 24 weeks of gestation or screening later (at 26 to 28 weeks). The USPSTF found limited data on the benefits and harms of screening before 24 weeks of gestation and is calling for more evidence in this period of pregnancy. The USPSTF wishes to clarify that the recommendation does not preclude later screening; however, other groups (such as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists) recommend screening between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation. The USPSTF updated the Practice Considerations section to clarify this point. Several respondents asked the USPSTF to include guidance on screening for preexisting diabetes and prediabetes in pregnant persons. The USPSTF recognizes the difficulty in distinguishing between gestational diabetes and previously undiagnosed diabetes; however, detection and management of preexisting diabetes during pregnancy is beyond the scope of this recommendation. Clinicians should continue to use their clinical judgment to determine if screening is appropriate for individual patients.</p><h2>Research Needs and Gaps</h2><p>The USPSTF identified several gaps in the evidence where more research is needed. These include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Studies (specifically RCTs) on the effect of screening for gestational diabetes and health outcomes.</li>\r\n<li>Studies examining the benefits and harms of screening for and treatment of gestational diabetes in pregnant persons before 24 weeks of gestation.</li>\r\n<li>Studies reporting on the effects of screening for gestational diabetes on populations defined by race/ethnicity, age, and other relevant socioeconomic factors.</li>\r\n<li>Studies examining how health outcomes differ by screening strategy (1- vs 2-step testing and various thresholds for gestational diabetes, fasting plasma glucose level, and HbA<sub>1c</sub> concentration).</li>\r\n<li>Greater consistency in both the diagnostic criteria and outcome definitions used in studies.</li>\r\n<li>More studies that report on maternal health outcomes, especially hypertension and preeclampsia.</li>\r\n<li>Studies focusing on longer-term outcomes (ie, obesity, impaired fasting glucose) for both pregnant persons and children.</li>\r\n<li>Studies on potential harms of screening and treatment (ie, anxiety, hospital experience, and cesarean delivery).</li>\r\n</ul><h2>Recommendations of Others</h2><p>Major guidelines from organizations in the US generally recommend universal rather than selective/risk-based screening at 24 to 28 weeks of gestation. Guidelines differ with respect to the number of tests and the diagnostic criteria applied. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the National Institutes of Health recommend screening all pregnant women for gestational diabetes using a 2-step screening strategy (using either Carpenter and Coustan criteria or NDDG criteria) at 24 to 28 weeks of gestation.<sup>1,39</sup> The American Diabetes Association recommends glucose testing for gestational diabetes in all asymptomatic pregnant women at 24 to 28 weeks of gestation using either 1-step (using IADPSG criteria) or 2-step (using Carpenter and Coustan criteria) screening.<sup>40</sup> The Endocrine Society recommends universal screening for gestational diabetes using the OGTT at 24 to 28 weeks of gestation.<sup>41</sup> The American Academy of Family Physicians endorses screening for gestational diabetes in asymptomatic pregnant women after 24 weeks of gestation.

This recommendation does not apply to children, persons who are pregnant or may become pregnant, or persons who are chronically ill, are hospitalized, or have a known nutritional deficiency.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF separately recommends that all persons who are planning or capable of pregnancy take a daily supplement containing 0.4 to 0.8 mg (400-800 &micro;g) of folic acid.<sup>4</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Treatment and Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>Vitamins (eg, vitamins A, C, D, E, and K and the B vitamins) are groups of chemically diverse organic compounds that are essential to maintaining normal metabolism.<sup>5</sup> Minerals (eg, calcium, iron, and zinc) are inorganic substances that humans also need to maintain function.<sup>6</sup> Vitamins and minerals can be combined, with or without other substances, in multivitamin or multimineral supplements.</p>\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>\r\n<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>\r\n<p>Cardiovascular disease and cancer are the 2 leading causes of death and combined account for approximately half of all deaths in the US annually.<sup>2</sup> According to 2015-2018 NHANES data, 26.1 million persons in the US have some form of cardiovascular disease (excluding hypertension).<sup>7</sup> Cardiovascular disease accounted for 803,191 deaths in the US in 2018, approximately 30% of all deaths.<sup>2</sup> Heart disease and stroke are most common among older adults, male individuals, and persons with low socioeconomic status and vary across racial and ethnic groups. The prevalence rates of cardiovascular disease, and notably stroke, are particularly high among Black persons and American Indian/Alaska Native persons compared with other races and ethnicities.<sup>7,8</sup></p>\r\n<p>In 2021, an estimated 1.9 million persons were diagnosed with cancer in the US.<sup>9</sup> Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the US and accounted for 599,274 deaths (21.1% of all deaths) in 2018.<sup>2</sup> Black males have the highest rates of cancer incidence of any sex and racial and ethnic group, and Black persons have the highest total cancer mortality and the highest mortality rates for most major cancer types.<sup>10</sup> Although the causes for this are not certain, it is likely because of social factors (eg, environmental exposures, systemic racism, disparities in access to care, and disparities in treatment).<sup>11</sup> It is not known what proportion of cardiovascular disease and cancer might be potentially preventable with vitamin or mineral supplementation.</p>\r\n<h4>Potential Harms</h4>\r\n<p>For many of the vitamins and nutrients reviewed, there was little evidence of serious harms. However, an important harm of increased lung cancer incidence was reported with the use of beta carotene by persons who smoke tobacco or have occupational exposure to asbestos.</p>\r\n<p>Excessive doses of vitamin supplements can cause several known adverse effects; for example, moderate doses of vitamin A supplements may reduce bone mineral density, and high doses may be hepatotoxic or teratogenic. Vitamin D has potential harms, such as a risk of hypercalcemia and kidney stones, when given at high doses. The potential for harm from other supplements at high doses should be carefully considered.</p>\r\n<h4>Current Practice</h4>\r\n<p>Contemporary data on the prevalence with which health care professionals recommend vitamins and minerals for cardiovascular disease and cancer prevention are limited. Older data suggest that it was common for health care professionals to recommend vitamin and mineral supplements to their patients for a variety of reasons such as overall health, bone health, musculoskeletal pain, or viral infections and immune health.<sup>12,13</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Other Related USPSTF Recommendations</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF has published several recommendations for prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer, including recommendations for smoking cessation,<sup>14</sup> screening for hypertension,<sup>15</sup> statin use to prevent cardiovascular disease,<sup>16</sup> aspirin use to prevent cardiovascular disease,<sup>17</sup> interventions to prevent obesity-related morbidity and mortality,<sup>18</sup> behavioral counseling to prevent cardiovascular disease in adults with risk factors,<sup>19</sup> medication use to reduce breast cancer risk,<sup>20</sup> behavioral counseling to decrease risk of skin cancer,<sup>21</sup> screening for breast,<sup>22</sup> cervical,<sup>23</sup> colorectal,<sup>24</sup> lung,<sup>25</sup> and prostate cancer,<sup>26</sup> and risk assessment, genetic counseling, and genetic testing for <em>BRCA</em>-related cancer.<sup>27</sup> The USPSTF has also published several recommendations related to vitamin and mineral supplementation, including vitamin D, calcium, or combined supplementation to prevent fractures in adults,<sup>28</sup> vitamin D supplementation to prevent falls in community-dwelling older adults,<sup>29</sup> and folic acid to prevent neural tube defects in persons who are planning or capable of pregnancy.<sup>4</sup></p><h2>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h2><p>This recommendation replaces the 2014 USPSTF recommendation statement on vitamin, mineral, and multivitamin supplements to prevent cardiovascular disease and cancer.<sup>30</sup> Although newer evidence was assessed, the USPSTF came to the same conclusions as it did in 2014, and the current recommendation statement is consistent with the 2014 recommendation. The USPSTF again concludes that the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of multivitamins and single- or paired-nutrient supplements (except beta carotene and vitamin E) for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or cancer. The USPSTF again recommends against the use of beta carotene or vitamin E supplements for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or cancer.</p>","other":"<h2>Supporting Evidence</h2><h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n<p>To update its 2014 recommendation statement, the USPSTF commissioned a systematic review<sup>31,32</sup> of the evidence on the efficacy of supplementation with single nutrients, functionally related nutrient pairs, or multivitamins for reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and mortality in the general adult population, as well as the harms of supplementation. The review focused on community-dwelling, nonpregnant adults 18 years or older without known cardiovascular disease or chronic disease (other than hypertension, overweight, or obesity) or nutritional deficiencies.</p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Supplementation</h3>\r\n<h4>Beta Carotene With or Without Vitamin A</h4>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found 6 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) reporting on health outcomes associated with beta carotene supplementation.<sup>31,32</sup> One of these trials studied beta carotene plus vitamin A supplementation.<sup>33</sup> A pooled analysis assessing association with beta carotene use showed an increased risk that was not statistically significant for all-cause mortality associated with beta carotene use over 4 to 12 years of follow-up (odds ratio [OR], 1.06 [95% CI, 1.00-1.12]; 6 RCTs; n = 112,820). A pooled analysis of 5 studies showed a statistically significant increased risk for cardiovascular disease mortality associated with beta carotene supplementation at 4 to 12 years of follow-up (Peto OR, 1.10 [95% CI, 1.02-1.19]; 5 RCTs; n = 94,506).<sup>31</sup> Two trials conducted in persons who smoke or were exposed to asbestos in the workplace found a significantly increased risk of lung cancer with beta carotene supplementation (risk ratio [RR], 1.18 [95% CI, 1.03-1.36])<sup>34</sup> and beta carotene plus vitamin A supplementation (adjusted RR, 1.28 [95% CI, 1.04-1.57]).<sup>33</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Vitamin A</h4>\r\n<p>One RCT reported no association between vitamin A supplementation and all-cause mortality (OR, 1.16 [95% CI, 0.80-1.69]).<sup>31,35</sup> The effects of vitamin A and beta carotene combined on lung cancer risk in persons at high risk<sup>33</sup> are noted above.</p>\r\n<h4>Vitamin E</h4>\r\n<p>Nine RCTs reported on health outcomes associated with vitamin E supplementation.<sup>31,32</sup> Pooled analyses demonstrated no benefit associated with vitamin E use on all-cause mortality (OR, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.97-1.07]; 9 RCTs; n = 107,772) after 3 to 10 years of follow-up or on the composite outcome of any cardiovascular disease event (OR, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.90-1.04]; 4 RCTs; n = 62,136) or cardiovascular disease mortality (OR, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.74-1.04]; 6 RCTs; n = 77,114). Pooled analyses also showed no benefit associated with vitamin E use on incidence of or mortality from any cancer.<sup>31</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Multivitamins</h4>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found 9 RCTs that reported on health outcomes associated with multivitamin supplementation.<sup>31,32</sup> A pooled analysis of these studies showed no association between multivitamin supplementation and all-cause mortality (OR, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.87-1.01]; 9 RCTs; n = 51,550). The largest trial, COSMOS (Cocoa Supplement and Multivitamin Outcomes Study; n = 21,442), also found no effect of multivitamin supplementation on all-cause mortality after a median of 3.6 years of follow-up (3.4% of participants taking a multivitamin had died compared with 3.6% who were taking a placebo; hazard ratio, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.81-1.08]).<sup>36</sup> Pooled analyses of 4 studies demonstrated no association between multivitamin use and cardiovascular disease mortality (OR, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.83-1.06]; 4 RCTs; n = 37,400) or cancer mortality (OR, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.81 to 1.09]; 4 RCTs; n = 37,400),<sup>30</sup> although a pooled analysis of 4 trials found a small decrease in cancer incidence (OR, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.87-0.99]; 4 RCTs; n = 48,859).<sup>31</sup> The body of evidence on the effects of multivitamin supplementation on mortality, CVD, and cancer outcomes has several limitations. As described above, multivitamin supplementation was not associated with an effect for most outcomes, and the effects on cancer incidence and mortality were not concordant. Of the 3 largest trials of vitamin supplementation (and the only trials to specifically focus on cardiovascular disease and cancer prevention), 2 focused on broad-spectrum multivitamins and 1 focused on antioxidants.<sup>36-38</sup> Additionally, 1 of these trials (PHS II, n = 14,641) was limited to male physicians.<sup>38</sup> Also, the largest of these trials (COSMOS, n = 21,442) had a median follow-up of only 3.6 years,<sup>36</sup> which may be too short for assessing cardiovascular disease and cancer outcomes. All of these factors limit the ability to determine whether supplementation may or may not have a benefit.</p>\r\n<h4>Vitamin D With or Without Calcium</h4>\r\n<p>Thirty-two RCTs reported on health outcomes associated with vitamin D with or without calcium supplementation; overall, results were very similar in studies examining the effects of vitamin D without calcium and those examining vitamin D and calcium combined.<sup>31,32</sup> A pooled analysis of 27 studies found no difference in all-cause mortality associated with vitamin D use (OR, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.91-1.02]; 27 RCTs; n = 117,082) after 6 months to 7 years of follow-up. Pooled analyses showed no between-group differences for cardiovascular disease mortality (OR, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.87-1.06]; 9 trials; n = 98,422), the composite outcome of any cardiovascular disease event (OR, 1.00 [95% CI, 0.95-1.05]; 7 RCTs; n = 74,925), or myocardial infarction or stroke. Pooled analyses also showed that vitamin D supplementation was not associated with any difference in cancer mortality (pooled OR, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.86-1.03]; 9 RCTs; n = 100,465) or cancer incidence (OR for any cancer, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.92-1.03]; 19 RCTs; n = 86,899) compared with placebo.<sup>31</sup> However, the 2 largest trials of vitamin D supplementation (VITAL, n = 25,871 and D-Health, 21,310) that reported on cancer mortality had point estimates for effect size that were on opposite sides of null (ORs, 0.82 and 1.15).<sup>39,40</sup> It is unclear whether the effect of vitamin D on health outcomes might vary based on patient population characteristics (eg, baseline vitamin D level or diet quality) or an unidentified factor. Additionally, the trials that reported on cancer mortality ranged from 3.3 to 7 years of follow-up,<sup>31</sup> which may be too short to detect an effect on cancer-specific mortality. These factors limit the ability to determine with certainty the effect of vitamin D on cancer incidence and mortality.</p>\r\n<h4>Calcium</h4>\r\n<p>Seven RCTs reported on health outcomes associated with calcium supplementation. Pooled analyses found no difference in all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease events, cardiovascular disease mortality, or any incidence of cancer in persons taking calcium, although the number of pooled trials was small and heterogeneity was high for some of these outcomes.<sup>31,32</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Folic Acid With or Without Vitamin B<sub>12</sub></h4>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found 5 RCTs that reported on health outcomes associated with folic acid in nonpregnant adults,<sup>31,32</sup> with 1 trial studying folic acid plus vitamin B<sub>12</sub> supplementation.<sup>41</sup> A pooled analysis showed no association between folic acid supplementation and all-cause mortality over 2 to 6.5 years. Event rates for cardiovascular disease mortality and cardiovascular disease events were too low to draw conclusions.<sup>31</sup> In a pooled analysis, folic acid either alone<sup>42,43</sup> or with vitamin B<sub>12</sub><sup>41</sup> was associated with higher rates of any cancer incidence at 2 to 6 years of follow-up.<sup>31</sup> However, 1 trial was limited to adults with moderately elevated homocysteine levels,<sup>41</sup> and the others were limited to adults with a history of colorectal adenomas.<sup>42,43</sup> Thus, the generalizability of this finding to the general population is uncertain.</p>\r\n<h4>Vitamin C</h4>\r\n<p>Two RCTs<sup>44-46</sup> suggested that vitamin C supplementation has no effect on all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease events, or cardiovascular disease mortality, although 1 of these trials was small and not powered for these outcomes. One trial<sup>46</sup> suggested that vitamin C supplementation has no effect on cancer incidence or mortality.</p>\r\n<h4>Vitamins B<sub>3</sub> and B<sub>6</sub></h4>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found insufficient evidence to assess the effects of these vitamins on all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease outcomes, or cancer outcomes.<sup>31,32</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Selenium</h4>\r\n<p>Although some individual studies showed conflicting results, the limited overall evidence suggests that selenium supplementation has no effect on all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease mortality, cardiovascular disease events, or cancer mortality.<sup>31,32</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Supplementation</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF also reviewed the evidence on the harms of vitamin and mineral supplements. For many supplements there was little to no evidence of serious harms.<sup>31,32</sup></p>\r\n<p>The most serious harm identified was increased cardiovascular disease mortality and increased risk of lung cancer in persons who smoke or had workplace asbestos exposure, associated with beta carotene supplementation at doses of 30 and 20 mg/d.<sup>33,34</sup> One of these trials also co-administered vitamin A at a dose of 25,000 IU/d,<sup>33</sup> which exceeds the current tolerable upper intake level for vitamin A in adults.<sup>47</sup> A minor harm of beta carotene was orange discoloration of the skin.<sup>31</sup> Two cohort studies in women showed a statistically nonsignificant increased risk of hip fracture associated with vitamin A supplementation.<sup>48,49</sup> Two trials<sup>34,45</sup> showed an increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke associated with vitamin E supplementation at doses of 111 and 200 IU daily, and 1 cohort study found that a high intake of vitamin B<sub>6</sub> (&ge;35 mg/d) was associated with an increased risk of hip fracture compared with a low intake (&lt;2 mg/d).<sup>50</sup></p>\r\n<p>One trial and 2 cohort studies reported an increased risk of kidney stones in persons taking vitamin D.<sup>31</sup> In the cohort studies, this risk was only associated with vitamin D doses of 1000 IU/d or more. Two cohort studies in men suggest an association between vitamin C supplementation and kidney stones.<sup>31</sup> The evidence on an association between calcium use and kidney stones was mixed.<sup>31</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from May 4 to June 1, 2021. In response to comments, the USPSTF specified the doses of beta carotene, vitamin A, and vitamin E used in trials reporting harms from these vitamins. Some comments requested that persons with chronic conditions or who are hospitalized be included in this recommendation. In response, the USPSTF wants to clarify that its recommendations apply to community-dwelling individuals without known underlying health conditions. Persons who have an acute or chronic illness may require additional vitamin, mineral, or multivitamin supplementation as part of management of their condition, which goes beyond supplementation for the prevention purposes addressed by this recommendation. Some comments requested additional detailed information from included studies. More information can be found in the accompanying evidence summary<sup>32</sup> and evidence report.<sup>31</sup> In addition, the USPSTF clarified that persons who experience food insecurity are among the populations of interest for the research gap on whether the effects of vitamin, mineral, and multivitamin supplementation on cardiovascular disease and cancer outcomes differ across specific populations.</p><h2>Research Needs and Gaps</h2><p>Studies are needed that provide more information on the following.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The effects of vitamin, mineral, and multivitamin supplementation on cardiovascular disease and cancer outcomes.

It is a multisystem inflammatory syndrome that is often progressive but has an unclear etiology. Worldwide, preeclampsia is the second most common cause of maternal morbidity and mortality. It is a complication in approximately 4% of pregnancies in the US and contributes to both maternal and infant morbidity and mortality.<sup>1</sup> Preeclampsia also accounts for 6% of preterm births and 19% of medically indicated preterm births in the US.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<p>There are racial and ethnic disparities in the prevalence of and mortality from preeclampsia. Non-Hispanic Black women are at greater risk for developing preeclampsia than other women and experience higher rates of maternal and infant morbidity and perinatal mortality than other racial and ethnic groups. In the US, the rate of maternal death from preeclampsia is higher among non-Hispanic Black women than non-Hispanic White women.<sup>1,2</sup> Disparities in risk factors for preeclampsia, access to early prenatal care, and obstetric interventions may account for some of the differences in prevalence and clinical outcomes.<sup>1</sup> These disparities largely result from historical and current manifestations of structural racism that influence environmental exposures, access to health resources, and overall health status.<sup>1,3,4</sup></p><h2>Recognition of Risk Status</h2><p>Persons with a history of preeclampsia in a previous pregnancy, pregestational type 1 or type 2 diabetes, and chronic hypertension are at highest risk for preeclampsia. Additional conditions that place a person at high risk for preeclampsia include multifetal gestation, autoimmune disease, and kidney disease. Factors associated with a moderate risk of preeclampsia include nulliparity, obesity (prepregnancy body mass index &gt; 30), family history of preeclampsia, advanced maternal age (35 years or older), in vitro conception, lower income, and personal history factors (eg, low birth weight or small for gestational age, previous adverse pregnancy outcome, &gt;10-year pregnancy interval).

Proteinuria is defined as a 24-hour urine collection containing greater than 300 mg protein, a single voided urine protein to creatinine ratio of 0.3 or greater, or a urine dipstick reading of 2+ (used only if other quantitative methods are not available). In the absence of proteinuria, preeclampsia is diagnosed as hypertension with any of the following: thrombocytopenia, impaired liver function, kidney insufficiency, pulmonary edema, or cerebral or visual disturbances.<sup>6</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>\r\n<p>Risk factors of preeclampsia can be categorized into those obtained by medical history, clinical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging. Most clinicians use medical history to identify pregnant persons at increased risk. Predictive models that combine risk factors to identify pregnant persons at risk for preeclampsia, such as serum biomarkers, uterine artery Doppler ultrasonography, and clinical history and measures, have been developed. However, there is limited evidence from external validation and implementation studies to demonstrate sufficient accuracy of predictive models for clinical use.<sup>1,7</sup></p>\r\n<p>Based on the risk assessment approaches used in the studies included in this review and the broader literature on clinical risk factors for preeclampsia, a pragmatic approach for identifying individuals who are candidates for aspirin prophylaxis is outlined in <a href=\"#tab1\">Table 1</a>. This approach may help to identify a patient population with an absolute risk for preeclampsia of at least 8%, which is consistent with the lowest preeclampsia incidence observed in control groups in studies reviewed by the USPSTF.<sup>1</sup> Pregnant persons with 1 or more high-risk factors should receive low-dose aspirin. Pregnant persons with moderate-risk factors may also benefit from low-dose aspirin (<a href=\"#tab1\">Table 1</a>). Clinicians should use clinical judgment in assessing the risk for preeclampsia and discuss the benefits and harms of low-dose aspirin use with their patients.</p>\r\n<h3>Treatment or Intervention</h3>\r\n<p>Interventions to manage preeclampsia, such as antihypertensive medication, early delivery, and magnesium sulfate treatment can reduce complications and mortality. The definitive treatment for preeclampsia is delivery of the placenta. However, manifestations of preeclampsia may take days or weeks to resolve, with some cases presenting in the postpartum period and requiring additional intervention.<sup>1</sup> Evidence demonstrates that aspirin use reduces the risk of preeclampsia in high-risk populations.<sup>1,8-10</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Timing and Dosage</h3>\r\n<p>Effective dosages of low-dose aspirin range from 60 to 150 mg/d.<sup>1</sup> Although studies did not evaluate a dosage of 81 mg/d, low-dose aspirin is available in the US as 81-mg tablets, which is a reasonable dose for prophylaxis in pregnant persons at high risk for preeclampsia.</p>\r\n<p>Low-dose aspirin use should be initiated after 12 weeks of gestation (studies most often initiated before 20 weeks of gestation).</p>\r\n<h3>Implementation</h3>\r\n<p>Risk factors, based on medical history, may help guide clinicians and their patients in the decision to begin aspirin use (<a href=\"#tab1\">Table 1</a>). Pregnant persons with 1 or more high-risk factors should receive low-dose aspirin. Pregnant persons with 2 or more moderate-risk factors may also benefit from low-dose aspirin (<a href=\"#tab1\">Table 1</a>), but the evidence is less certain for this approach. Clinicians should use clinical judgment in assessing the risk for preeclampsia and discuss the benefits and harms of low-dose aspirin use with their patients. In October 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration released a safety drug communication warning that the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs around 20 weeks of gestation or later may cause rare but serious kidney problems in unborn infants, resulting in low levels of amniotic fluid.<sup>11</sup> An exception to this warning is the use of an 81-mg dose of aspirin for certain pregnancy-related conditions under the direction of a health care clinician.<sup>11</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Other Related USPSTF Recommendations</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF has also issued recommendations for numerous conditions in pregnant persons, including screening for preeclampsia<sup>12</sup> and folic acid supplementation to prevent neural tube defects.<sup>13</sup> Other related USPSTF recommendations are available at <a  href=\"https://uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/\">https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/</a>.</p><h2>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h2><p>In the 2014 recommendation, the USPSTF recommended the use of low-dose aspirin (81 mg/d) as preventive medication after 12 weeks of gestation in persons at high risk for preeclampsia (B recommendation).<sup>14</sup> The current recommendation is consistent with the 2014 recommendation. It is strengthened by new evidence from additional trials supporting reduced risks of perinatal mortality with low-dose aspirin use.</p>","other":"<h2>Supporting Evidence</h2><h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF commissioned a systematic review<sup>1,15</sup> to evaluate the effectiveness of low-dose aspirin use to prevent preeclampsia. The current review included evidence on the effectiveness of low-dose aspirin in preventing preeclampsia in pregnant persons at increased risk and in decreasing adverse maternal and perinatal health outcomes, as well as assessing the maternal and fetal harms of low-dose aspirin use during pregnancy.</p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Risk Assessment and Preventive Medication</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF considered 18 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) (n = 15,908) to assess maternal and perinatal health outcomes and 16 RCTs (n = 15,767; 10 good-quality) to assess prevention of preeclampsia.<sup>1</sup> All trials were placebo-controlled.<sup>1</sup> The 3 largest trials included 1 conducted in the US and 2 large, multinational trials coordinated from the UK. Fifteen smaller trials were conducted in various developed countries.<sup>1,8,16-18</sup></p>\r\n<p>In general, trial participants were young (mean age range, 20.4 to 33.5 years) and White individuals. Only 3 trials included majority populations of Black individuals (range, 50% to 72%).<sup>1</sup> Studies most often initiated low-dose aspirin before 20 weeks of gestation, but initiation ranged from at 11 to 32 weeks of gestation and generally continued until delivery or near term. Nulliparous and multiparous participants were combined in most trials. Aspirin dosages ranged from 50 to 150 mg/d, with most trials using 60 mg/d (6 RCTs) or 100 mg/d (8 RCTs).<sup>1</sup> Included trials of selected participants at increased risk for preeclampsia used a variety of approaches to identify the study population.<sup>1</sup> The incidence of preeclampsia in the placebo groups therefore also varied considerably, but the proportion developing preeclampsia were generally 2 to 3 times higher than the average incidence in the US.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found evidence of a reduction in risk for preterm birth (pooled relative risk [RR], 0.80 [95% CI, 0.67-0.95]; 13 studies; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 49%) among individuals at increased risk for preeclampsia who received low-dose aspirin (n = 13,619). Pooled estimates provided evidence of a reduction in risk for small for gestational age/intrauterine growth restriction (RR, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.68-0.99]; 16 studies; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 41.0%) in individuals at increased risk for preeclampsia (n = 14,385). There was also a reduction in perinatal mortality (pooled RR, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.66-0.96]; 11 studies; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 0%) in individuals at increased risk for preeclampsia (n = 13,860).<sup>1</sup> The USPSTF found evidence of a reduction in risk for preeclampsia (pooled RR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.75-0.95]; 16 studies; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 0%) with low-dose aspirin use in individuals at increased risk (n = 14,093). Maternal complications of preeclampsia (eg, eclampsia or death) rarely occurred in studies and could not be evaluated.</p>\r\n<p>Stratified comparisons did not show consistent evidence for effect differences related to intervention or population characteristics such as the timing of aspirin initiation (&lt;16 weeks of gestation), the dosage of aspirin used, or participant characteristics.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Risk Assessment and Preventive Medication</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF considered 21 RCTs (n = 26,757; 14 good-quality, 7 fair-quality) to assess maternal, perinatal, and developmental harms. Studies of average-risk pregnant individuals (5 trials) were included with trials of participants at increased risk (16 trials).<sup>1</sup> All trials were placebo-controlled, except 1 study in which participants in the control group received usual care with no placebo. Harms consistently reported across studies were placental abruption, postpartum hemorrhage, and fetal intracranial bleeding.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<p>Trials did not demonstrate evidence of harms from daily low-dose aspirin use during pregnancy. Bleeding harms were uncommon. Pooled results were not statistically significant for placental abruption (pooled RR, 1.15 [95% CI, 0.76-1.72]; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 25%; 10 trials; n = 24,970), postpartum hemorrhage (pooled RR, 1.03 [95% CI, 0.94-1.12]; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 0%; 9 trials; n = 23,133), or fetal intracranial bleeding (pooled RR, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.51-1.57]; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 19%; 6 trials; n = 23,719).<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found limited evidence on long-term child developmental outcomes in offspring from in utero exposure to low-dose aspirin. Follow-up data from the largest trial, the Collaborative Low-dose Aspirin Study in Pregnancy (CLASP), reported no differences in physical or developmental outcomes (eg, gross motor development, height, weight, or hospital visits) in infants at age 12 and 18 months.<sup>13</sup> No differences were found within a few studies reporting other rare perinatal harms (eg, congenital anomalies or malformations).<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF also did not find a difference in harms by the aspirin dosage or timing of aspirin initiation or for specific populations based on limited subgroup comparisons.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<h3>How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?</h3>\r\n<p>Preeclampsia is a complex, multisystem inflammatory syndrome that can originate from multiple causes and is thought to evolve from changes in placental development that result in placental ischemia. Poor placental perfusion may produce inflammation and oxidative stress. Preeclampsia may also develop because of overactive inflammatory responses to normal placentation. Preexisting inflammatory conditions are also thought to trigger systemic inflammatory and oxidative stress processes. The anti-inflammatory, antiangiogenesis, and antiplatelet properties of low-dose aspirin are believed to account for its preventive effect on preeclampsia.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from February 23, 2021, to March 22, 2021. Comments asked for an explicit acknowledgment of the role of systemic racism in the prevalence of and mortality from preeclampsia. As a result, the USPSTF added language to the Importance section. Several comments asked for clarification of risk factors. In response, the USPSTF revised <a href=\"#tab1\">Table 1</a> and the Implementation section. A respondent asked about harms of aspirin; the USPSTF added language to the Implementation section. The USPSTF also added clarifying language to the Practice Considerations section.</p><h2>Research Needs and Gaps</h2><p>There are several critical evidence gaps. Studies are needed that provide more information on the following.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Research is needed on how to improve identifying pregnant persons at increased risk for preeclampsia. Research to further develop and evaluate the effectiveness of risk assessment tools using clinical history alone or combined with clinical testing could help clinicians better identify pregnant persons who could benefit from aspirin as preventive medication.</li>\r\n<li>Further research is needed in populations that have the highest rates of preeclampsia, including Black persons. Future trials should recruit adequate numbers of persons from varying racial and ethnic populations, such as Black persons, to have sufficient power to determine the effectiveness of different aspirin dosages and timing of initiation in the populations that bear the greatest disease burden.</li>\r\n<li>Comparative effectiveness trials are needed to identify the specific aspirin protocol (eg, dosage, timing, continuation, and time of day) likely to have the greatest benefit.</li>\r\n<li>Studies are needed to more fully understand the populations most likely to benefit from aspirin prophylaxis and what risk threshold and factors should be used to identify eligible patient populations.</li>\r\n<li>Research is needed on aspirin effectiveness for all hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.</li>\r\n<li>Research is needed to improve effective and equitable implementation of clinical guidelines for aspirin use in pregnancy.</li>\r\n</ul><h2>Recommendations of Others</h2><p>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine<sup>19</sup> recommend low-dose aspirin (81 mg/d) prophylaxis for persons at high risk of preeclampsia; the regimen should be initiated between 12 and 28 weeks of gestation (optimally before 16 weeks) and continued daily until delivery.<sup>1</sup> Additionally, low-dose aspirin prophylaxis should be considered for individuals with more than 1 of several moderate-risk factors for preeclampsia. Persons at risk of preeclampsia are defined based on the presence of 1 or more high-risk factors (history of preeclampsia, multifetal gestation, kidney disease, autoimmune disease, type 1 or type 2 diabetes, and chronic hypertension) or more than 1 of several moderate-risk factors (first pregnancy, maternal age 35 years or older, a body mass index greater than 30, family history of preeclampsia, sociodemographic characteristics, and personal history factors). The World Health Organization<sup>20</sup> and the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association<sup>21</sup> also recommend low-dose aspirin use for the prevention of preeclampsia in persons at increased risk.</p>","topic":"Aspirin Use to Prevent Preeclampsia and Related Morbidity and Mortality: Preventive Medication","keywords":"Aspirin|Preeclampsia|Pregnancy","pubDate":"2021-09-28","categories":["2"],"tool":["361","363","362"]},"448":{"topicType":"Screening","topicYear":2021,"uspstfAlias":"carotid-artery-stenosis-screening","specific":[1909],"title":"Asymptomatic Carotid Artery Stenosis: Screening","rationale":"<h2>Importance</h2><p>Carotid artery stenosis is atherosclerotic disease that affects extracranial carotid arteries.

Auscultation for carotid bruits has been found to have poor accuracy for detecting carotid stenosis or stroke and is not considered a reasonable screening approach.<sup>7</sup> The USPSTF does not recommend screening adults without a history of transient ischemic attack, stroke, or other neurologic signs or symptoms referable to the carotid arteries.</p>\r\n<h3>Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>Medical and surgical options are available for treatment of carotid artery stenosis. In general, treatment of asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis is directed at systemic atherosclerotic disease and often includes statins, antiplatelet medications, management of hypertension and diabetes, and lifestyle modification interventions. Surgical procedures designed to improve carotid artery blood flow include carotid endarterectomy (CEA), carotid artery angioplasty and stenting (CAS), or transartery revascularization. Medical therapy can be used alone or with revascularization procedures.<sup>7</sup> For patients with asymptomatic disease, the harms of surgical interventions compared with appropriate medical therapy appear to outweigh the benefits.</p>\r\n<h3>Other Related USPSTF Recommendations</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF has issued other recommendation statements related to stroke prevention and cardiovascular health.

However, this evidence from 2014 was limited by lack of information on the proportion of patients who were asymptomatic and by clinically important variation in DUS measurement by patient population, equipment, technique, and other factors.<sup>8</sup> For auscultating the neck for carotid bruits, the 2014 evidence review found a wide range in sensitivity (46%-77%) and specificity (71%-98%) for detecting carotid artery stenosis. Of the 4 included studies, none used angiography as a reference standard and only 2 enrolled patients from the general population.<sup>8</sup></p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no externally validated risk stratification tools that could reliably distinguish between asymptomatic persons who have clinically important carotid artery stenosis and persons who do not, or the risk of stroke related to carotid artery stenosis.<sup>7-9</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no studies that directly examined the health benefits of screening with DUS.<sup>7-9</sup></p>\r\n<p>The 2014 review found 3 randomized clinical trials (n = 5226) that assessed the benefits of treating asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis (defined as stenosis &ge;50%) with CEA compared with medical therapy alone over 2.7 to 9 years. These studies included participants with cardiovascular disease risk factors such as diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesteremia, and coronary artery disease. Pooled analyses found that, compared with patients receiving medical therapy alone, 2.0% fewer patients treated with CEA had perioperative stroke or death and subsequent ipsilateral stroke (combined outcome) and 3.5% fewer patients treated with CEA had perioperative stroke or death and any subsequent stroke (combined outcome).<sup>8</sup> However, none of the trials focused on exclusively asymptomatic populations identified by primary care screening. Between 20% and 32% of trial patients reported a history of contralateral artery transient ischemic attack, stroke, or CEA at baseline.<sup>8</sup> Additionally, requirements for asymptomatic status differed slightly across the trials. For example, 1 study enrolled participants with no transient ischemic attack or stroke attributable to the ipsilateral artery for the past 6 months, while another enrolled participants with no history of cerebrovascular events in the distribution of the ipsilateral carotid artery and no symptoms referable to the contralateral artery for the past 45 days. Medical therapy varied by trial and may not reflect contemporary aggressive risk factor modification, and operators (eg, surgeons and interventionists) were highly selected based on their low morbidity and mortality rates.<sup>8</sup> Because of these limitations, the USPSTF concluded that the magnitude of any benefit would be smaller in asymptomatic persons in the general population than among patients in the trials.<sup>4</sup></p>\r\n<p>The current review found 2 new fair-quality studies conducted in Europe that were prematurely terminated because of low recruitment or interim analysis showing that patients randomized to best medical therapy had unexpectedly higher rates of ipsilateral stroke or death than patients randomized to CEA.<sup>7,9</sup> Results from comparative effectiveness studies of CEA plus best medical therapy compared with best medical therapy alone were mixed. The Stent-Protected Angioplasty in Asymptomatic Carotid Artery Stenosis vs Endarterectomy 2 (SPACE-2) trial (n = 316) found no difference between groups in the composite outcome of stroke or death at 30 days of follow-up or ipsilateral ischemic stroke at 1 year of follow-up (unadjusted hazard ratio [HR], 2.82 [95% CI, 0.33-24.07]).<sup>17</sup> The Aggressive Medical Treatment Evaluation for Asymptomatic Carotid Artery Stenosis (AMTEC) trial (n = 55) found that patients who underwent CEA had a significantly lower composite risk of nonfatal ipsilateral stroke or death at 3.3 median years of follow-up than patients who received best medical therapy alone (calculated unadjusted HR, 0.20 [95% CI, 0.06-0.65]).<sup>7,18</sup></p>\r\n<p>The 2014 review found no studies that compared CAS with medical therapy.<sup>8</sup> The current review<sup>7</sup> identified 1 trial that compared CAS with best medical therapy; in this trial, there were no significant differences between groups in the composite outcome of stroke or death at 30 days of follow-up or in ipsilateral ischemic stroke at 1 year of follow-up (unadjusted HR, 3.50 [95% CI, 0.42-29.11]).<sup>17</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no studies that directly examined the harms of screening using DUS.<sup>8</sup></p>\r\n<p>The 2014 review found that DUS leads to many false-positive results when screening the general population, which has a low prevalence of carotid artery stenosis (0.5%-1%).<sup>8</sup> The 2014 review found 2 studies of angiography, a confirmatory testing method that is less commonly used today than noninvasive magnetic resonance angiography or computed tomography angiography. Of patients who had angiography, 0.4% to 1.2% had strokes as a result.<sup>8</sup> The current review found no new studies on the harms of confirmatory testing methods.<sup>7</sup></p>\r\n<p>The 2014 review found 3 trials that reported on harms of CEA or CAS, most of which were conducted during the 1990s.<sup>8</sup> Many study participants had hypertension, coronary artery disease, or diabetes. Pooled analysis of data from 6 trials (n = 3435) found that 2.4% (95% CI, 1.7%-3.1%) of patients died or had a stroke within the 30 days after CEA. A meta-analysis of 3 trials (n = 5223) found that 1.9% (95% CI, 1.2%-2.6%) more participants treated with CEA had perioperative (30-day) stroke or death than participants treated with medical therapy. A meta-analysis of 2 trials (n = 6152) found that 3.1% (95% CI, 2.7%-3.6%) of patients died or had a stroke after CAS. Pooled data from 7 cohort studies found that 3.3% (95% CI, 2.7%-3.9%) of patients died or had a stroke within 30 days after CEA.<sup>8</sup> One cohort study found that 3.8% (95% CI, 2.9%-5.1%) of patients had a stroke or died within 30 days after CAS.<sup>19</sup></p>\r\n<p>The current review found 2 fair-quality trials that assessed perioperative harms.<sup>7,9</sup> In the SPACE-2 trial, 2.5% of patients who underwent CAS or CEA died or had a stroke within 30 days after their procedure.<sup>17</sup> The AMTEC trial reported 1 patient (3.2%) who had a fatal postoperative stroke after CEA.<sup>18</sup> The current review identified several large national databases and surgical registries that measured postoperative outcomes associated with CEA (n = 1,903,761) or CAS (n = 332,103).<sup>7,9</sup> The proportion of patients experiencing 30-day postoperative stroke or death after CEA ranged from 1.4% in the Vascular Quality Initiative<sup>20</sup> to 3.5% in a large Medicare database.<sup>21</sup> The proportion that experienced 30-day postoperative stroke or death after CAS ranged from 2.6%<sup>20</sup> to 5.1% (Medicare database).<sup>21</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comments</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from August 4, 2020, to August 31, 2020. Several comments noted that the term &ldquo;general adult population&rdquo; includes patients who may be at increased risk for carotid artery stenosis or stroke and noted that other organizations recommend screening in these higher-risk individuals. Several risk factors for developing carotid artery stenosis are noted in the recommendation, including hypertension, diabetes, smoking, and hypercholesterolemia. The studies included in the review included participants with these risk factors, and the USPSTF found no benefit in screening asymptomatic populations. The USPSTF added language to clarify this point. No reliable tools are available to determine which individuals are at increased risk for carotid artery stenosis or are at increased risk of stroke when carotid artery stenosis is present. Respondents questioned the USPSTF&rsquo;s conclusions regarding the harms associated with surgical interventions and the comparative benefit of best medical therapy vs CEA. Comments pointed to several studies that demonstrate the benefits of CEA over best medical therapy to reduce stroke risk in asymptomatic persons. Comments also noted that new, safer procedures are now available (ie, transcarotid artery revascularization) that were not reviewed and that may shift the balance of net benefit. The USPSTF reviewed all available evidence and concluded that the magnitude of benefit would be smaller in truly asymptomatic persons in the general population than among selected patients in trials. The USPSTF added language about the new studies it considered. The review found no studies that examined the benefits and harms of transcarotid artery revascularization.</p><h2>Research Needs and Gaps</h2><p>More research is needed to evaluate the benefits and harms of screening for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis in the general adult population.

In this recommendation statement, CVD risk and the net benefits of aspirin use are discussed using the terms &ldquo;men&rdquo; and &ldquo;women,&rdquo; although it is likely that CVD risk and net benefit estimates are driven by sex (ie, male/female) rather than gender identity.</p>\r\n<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>\r\n<h4>CVD Risk</h4>\r\n<p>Older age is one of the strongest risk factors for CVD. Men have a higher overall CVD disease burden, although women experience higher mortality from certain cardiovascular events, such as stroke. Men tend to experience CVD events earlier in life compared with women. The burden of CVD also differs by race and ethnicity. Among both sexes, Black persons have the highest prevalence of CVD.<sup>2</sup></p>\r\n<p>The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) Pooled Cohort Equations may be used to estimate 10-year risk of CVD. The ACC/AHA risk estimator is, to date, the only US-based CVD risk prediction tool that has published external validation studies in other US-based populations.<sup>4</sup> The estimator has separate equations based on sex and for Black persons and non-Black persons, which include the risk factors of age, cholesterol levels, systolic blood pressure level, antihypertension treatment, presence of diabetes, and smoking status, and focuses on hard clinical outcomes (myocardial infarction and death from coronary heart disease; ischemic stroke and stroke-related death) as the outcomes of interest. It is important to note that increasing age heavily influences the ACC/AHA estimated 10-year CVD event risk. The risk prediction equations generally show higher risk for Black persons than White persons.<sup>4</sup> The USPSTF recognizes that race is a social construct and an imperfect proxy for social determinants of health and the effects of structural racism. Concerns about calibration exist, with many external validation studies showing overprediction in broad populations (men and women across racial and ethnic groups).<sup>5-7</sup> Limited evidence also suggests underprediction in disadvantaged communities<sup>8,9</sup> that could lead to underutilization of preventive therapies. Clinicians should recognize that predictions of 10-year CVD events using the Pooled Cohort Equations are estimates.</p>\r\n<h4>Bleeding Risk</h4>\r\n<p>The risk for gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, and hemorrhagic stroke, with or without aspirin use, increases with older age. Other risk factors include male sex, diabetes, history of gastrointestinal issues (such as peptic ulcer disease), liver disease, smoking, and elevated blood pressure. Certain medications, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, steroids, and anticoagulants, increase the risk of bleeding.<sup>10-13</sup> These risk factors should be considered in the overall decision about whether to start or continue aspirin therapy.</p>\r\n<h3>Treatment or Intervention</h3>\r\n<p>The benefits of aspirin for CVD prevention appear similar for a low dose (&le;100 mg/d) and for all doses that have been studied in CVD prevention trials (50 to 500 mg/d).<sup>14</sup> A pragmatic approach would be to use 81 mg/d, which is the most commonly prescribed dose in the US.</p>\r\n<h3>Implementation</h3>\r\n<p>Because CVD risk estimation is imprecise and imperfect at the individual level, the USPSTF suggests using these risk estimates as a starting point to discuss with appropriate candidates their desire for daily aspirin use. The benefits of initiating aspirin use are greater for individuals at higher risk for CVD events (eg, those with &gt;15% or &gt;20% 10-year CVD risk).</p>\r\n<p>In addition to age and estimated level of CVD risk, decisions about initiating aspirin use should be based on shared decision-making between clinicians and patients about the potential benefits and harms. Persons who place a higher value on the potential benefits (decreasing an individual&rsquo;s risk of a myocardial infarction or stroke) than the potential harms (the risk of gastrointestinal or intracranial bleeding) may choose to initiate low-dose aspirin use. Persons who place a higher value on the potential harms or the burden of taking a daily preventive medication than on the potential benefits may choose not to initiate low-dose aspirin use.</p>\r\n<h3>Stopping Age</h3>\r\n<p>Annual bleeding events in individuals without risk factors for increased bleeding (eg, history of gastrointestinal bleeding risk, history of peptic ulcer disease, or use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or corticosteroids) are rare, but risk for bleeding increases modestly with advancing age.<sup>12</sup> For persons who have initiated aspirin use, the net benefits continue to accrue over time in the absence of a bleeding event. The net benefits, however, generally become progressively smaller with advancing age because of an increased risk for bleeding, and modeling data suggest that it may be reasonable to consider stopping aspirin use around age 75 years.</p>\r\n<h3>Additional Tools and Resources</h3>\r\n<p>Million Hearts 2022 is a national initiative to prevent 1 million myocardial infarctions and strokes within 5 years.

The USPSTF previously found that the evidence was insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of initiating aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD and CRC in adults younger than 50 years or adults 70 years or older.</p>\r\n<p>For the current recommendation, the USPSTF has changed the age ranges and grades of its recommendation on aspirin use. The USPSTF recommends that the decision to initiate low-dose aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD in adults aged 40 to 59 years who have a 10% or greater 10-year CVD risk should be an individual one and recommends against initiating low-dose aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD in adults 60 years or older. Based on new trial evidence,<sup>24</sup> updated analyses of the evidence from primary CVD prevention populations,<sup>14</sup> and longer-term follow-up data from the Women&rsquo;s Health Study (WHS) (I.-M. Lee, ScD, Harvard Medical School, written communication, November 23, 2020), the USPSTF concluded that the evidence is inadequate that low-dose aspirin use reduces CRC incidence or mortality.</p>","other":"<h2>Recommendations of Others</h2><p>The ACC/AHA recommends that low-dose aspirin use (75 to 100 mg/d) might be considered for the primary prevention of atherosclerotic CVD among select adults aged 40 to 70 years at higher CVD risk but not at increased risk of bleeding. Low-dose aspirin use is not recommended on a routine basis for primary prevention of CVD in adults older than 70 years or among adults of any age who are at increased risk of bleeding.<sup>35</sup> The American Academy of Family Physicians supports the 2016 USPSTF recommendation on aspirin use.<sup>36</sup></p>","discussion":"<h2>Supporting Evidence</h2><h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n<p>To update its 2016 recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a systematic review on the effectiveness of aspirin to reduce the risk of CVD events (myocardial infarction and stroke), cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality in persons without a history of CVD. The systematic review also investigated the effect of aspirin use on CRC incidence and mortality in primary CVD prevention populations, as well as the harms, particularly bleeding harms, associated with aspirin use.<sup>14,25</sup></p>\r\n<p>In addition to the systematic evidence review, the USPSTF commissioned a microsimulation modeling study to assess the net balance of benefits and harms from aspirin use for primary prevention of CVD and CRC, stratified by age, sex, and CVD risk level. Modeling study parameter inputs were informed by the results of the systematic review, and the primary outcomes were net benefits expressed as quality-adjusted life-years and life-years.<sup>26,27</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Preventive Medication</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF considered 13 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) involving 161,680 participants that reported on the benefits of aspirin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.<sup>14,25</sup> Most trials used low-dose aspirin of 100 mg/d or less or aspirin every other day and included a balanced number of male and female participants and a broad distribution of ages, with mean age ranging from 53 years in the Physicians' Health Study<sup>28</sup> to 74 years in the Aspirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) trial.<sup>24</sup></p>\r\n<p>The evidence showed that aspirin use for primary prevention of CVD was associated with a decreased risk of myocardial infarction and stroke but not cardiovascular mortality or all-cause mortality. Results were similar when including studies using all doses of aspirin compared with studies using low-dose aspirin.<sup>14</sup> Since low-dose aspirin is most relevant to current practice, the analyses below report outcomes pooling studies of low-dose aspirin use. Pooled effect estimates of studies using low-dose aspirin were also used to inform the parameters and assumptions of the microsimulation modeling study.<sup>26,27</sup></p>\r\n<p>A pooled analysis of 11 trials (n = 134,470) showed that low-dose aspirin use was associated with a statistically significant decreased risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction (Peto odds ratio [OR], 0.88 [95% CI, 0.80-0.96]). Similarly, a pooled analysis of 5 trials (n = 54,947) demonstrated that low-dose aspirin use was associated with a statistically significant decreased risk of nonfatal ischemic stroke (Peto OR, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.78-1.00]; <em>P</em> = .046). Fatal cardiovascular events were less common, so pooled analyses showed that low-dose aspirin use was not associated with a statistically significant effect on fatal myocardial infarction, fatal stroke, cardiovascular mortality, or all-cause mortality (at 3.6 to 10.1 years of follow-up).<sup>14,25</sup> Although evidence does not suggest that the relative effect of aspirin on CVD outcomes is modified by baseline CVD risk, the absolute magnitude of the benefit is greater in persons at higher CVD risk.</p>\r\n<p>New RCT data, as well as newly available information on the age distribution of participants in the WHS, show that almost 22 000 participants younger than 50 years and more than 37,000 participants 70 years or older were included in the CVD prevention trials. Most trials with age subanalyses did not find a statistically significant difference in the relative effect of aspirin on CVD outcomes by age.<sup>14,25</sup> The USPSTF thus concluded that evidence on the benefits of aspirin on CVD outcomes was adequate for all groups, including adults aged 40 to 49 years and adults 70 years or older.</p>\r\n<p>The evidence review found fewer studies reporting on the effects of aspirin use on CRC incidence or mortality. Four studies conducted in primary CVD prevention populations found no association between aspirin use and CRC incidence at up to approximately 10 years of follow-up.<sup>14,25</sup> Only 1 trial, the WHS (n = 39,876), reported on the effect of low-dose aspirin use on CRC incidence beyond 10 years by including posttrial observational follow-up. Although the WHS reported a lower incidence of CRC at 17.5 years of follow-up (Peto OR, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.69-0.98]),29 recent data showed that this effect did not persist from 17.5 to 26 years of follow-up (I.-M. Lee, ScD, Harvard Medical School, written communication, November 23, 2020). Two RCTs, ASPREE<sup>24</sup> and WHS (I.-M. Lee, ScD, Harvard Medical School, written communication, November 23, 2020), reported CRC mortality during the trial phase. ASPREE reported that aspirin use was associated with statistically significantly higher CRC mortality at 4.7 years of follow-up (Peto OR, 1.74 [95% CI, 1.02-2.95]), while the WHS did not find a statistically significant increase in CRC mortality at 10 years. When including observational follow-up beyond the trial phase, 2 trials of low-dose aspirin use reported reductions in CRC mortality. In the Thrombosis Prevention Trial<sup>30,31</sup> (n = 5085), low-dose aspirin use was associated with a statistically significant lower risk of CRC mortality at 18.3 years of follow-up (Peto OR, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.41-0.94]), and the WHS reported lower CRC mortality at 17.5 years of follow-up that was not statistically significant (Peto OR, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.64-1.16]) and was attenuated from 17.5 to 26 years of follow-up (I.-M. Lee, ScD, Harvard Medical School, written communication, November 23, 2020).</p>\r\n<p>The body of evidence on the effects of aspirin use on CRC incidence and mortality is limited by several factors. Overall, only a small number of trials reported on CRC outcomes. The ASPREE trial in older adults found aspirin use to be associated with an increased risk of CRC mortality.<sup>24</sup> Although this finding does not constitute firm evidence that aspirin use is associated with increased risk of CRC mortality, it is one factor that calls into question whether aspirin use has a beneficial effect on CRC outcomes. Longer-term follow-up data suggesting that aspirin use is associated with lower CRC risk is heavily weighted by 1 trial conducted in women only, and the evidence on CRC mortality is limited by few CRC deaths. Additionally, posttrial follow-up data may be subject to biases, and in some cases, CRC outcomes data were collected by outside investigators.<sup>14,25</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Preventive Medication</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed 14 RCTs in CVD primary prevention populations that reported on the bleeding harms of aspirin. Studies reported a variety of outcomes, including total major bleeds (defined as a composite of intracranial hemorrhage, major gastrointestinal bleeding, or major bleeding from other sites), major gastrointestinal bleeds (defined as a gastrointestinal bleed that required a transfusion, hospital admission, or resulted in death), extracranial bleeds (defined as major bleeding that was not intracranial), hemorrhagic stroke, and intracranial bleeds (defined as hemorrhagic stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and subdural hemorrhage).<sup>14,25</sup></p>\r\n<p>When looking at studies reporting on the harms of low-dose aspirin use (&le;100 mg/d), which is most relevant to current practice, a pooled analysis of 10 trials (n = 119,130) showed that aspirin use was associated with a 58% increase in major gastrointestinal bleeding (Peto OR, 1.58 [95% CI, 1.38-1.80]). A pooled analysis of 11 trials (n = 134,470) showed an increase in intracranial bleeds in the aspirin group compared with the control group (Peto OR, 1.31 [95% CI, 1.11-1.54]). Low-dose aspirin use was not associated with a statistically significant increase in risk of fatal hemorrhagic stroke.<sup>14,25</sup></p>\r\n<p>Data suggest that the increased incidence of bleeding associated with aspirin use occurs relatively quickly after initiating aspirin, and data do not suggest that aspirin has a differential relative bleeding risk based on age, sex, presence of diabetes, level of CVD risk, or race or ethnicity.<sup>14,25</sup> Although the increase in relative risk does not appear to differ based on age, the absolute incidence of bleeding, and thus the magnitude of bleeding harm, increases with age, and more so in adults 60 years or older. Because of the very small number of fatal gastrointestinal bleeding events in trials and inconsistent reporting, it is uncertain whether aspirin use increases fatal gastrointestinal bleeding.<sup>14,25</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF commissioned a microsimulation model to estimate the magnitude of net benefit of low-dose aspirin use.<sup>26,27</sup> The model incorporated findings from the systematic review to inform its parameters and assumptions, including that daily low-dose (&le;100 mg/d) aspirin use reduces the risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction and nonfatal stroke, increases the risk of major gastrointestinal bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage, and has no effect on the risk of CVD mortality. As there was insufficient evidence that aspirin use reduces CRC incidence, the modeling study base case assumed no effect of aspirin on CRC incidence.</p>\r\n<p>Modeling outcomes were stratified by age, decade of aspirin initiation (40-49 years, 50-59 years, 60-69 years, and 70-79 years), sex, and baseline 10-year CVD risk level (5% to 20%). When combined with primary trial data and pooled analyses from the systematic evidence review, the model provided additional information to assess the balance of benefits and harms of aspirin use. The primary model outcomes were net quality-adjusted life-years and life-years gained or lost over a lifetime as a result of aspirin use. Also considered was the effect of stopping aspirin that had been initiated for primary prevention over 5-year age intervals from ages 65 to 85 years.<sup>26,27</sup></p>\r\n<p>Modeling data estimated that aspirin use in both men and women aged 40 to 59 years with 10% or greater 10-year CVD risk generally provides a modest net benefit in both quality-adjusted life-years and life-years gained. Initiation of aspirin use in persons aged 60 to 69 years results in quality-adjusted life-years gained that range from slightly negative to slightly positive depending on CVD risk level, and life-years gained are generally negative. In persons aged 70 to 79 years, initiation of aspirin use results in a loss of both quality-adjusted life-years and life-years at essentially all CVD risk levels modeled (ie, up to 20% 10-year CVD risk) (<a href=\"#fig\">Figure</a>).<sup>26,27</sup> The USPSTF thus determined that aspirin use has a small net benefit in persons aged 40 to 59 years with 10% or greater 10-year CVD risk and that initiation of aspirin use has no net benefit in persons 60 years or older.</p>\r\n<p>When looking at net lifetime benefit of continuous aspirin use until stopping at age 65, 70, 75, 80, or 85 years, modeling data suggested that there is generally little incremental lifetime net benefit in continuing aspirin use beyond the age of 75 to 80 years.<sup>26,27</sup> It is important to note that the net benefit of continuing aspirin use by persons in their 60s or 70s is not the same as the net benefit of initiating aspirin use by persons in their 60s or 70s. This is because, in part, CVD risk is heavily influenced by age. Persons who meet the eligibility criteria for aspirin use at a younger age (ie, &ge;10% 10-year CVD risk in their 40s or 50s) typically would have even higher CVD risk by their 60s or 70s compared with persons who first reach a 10% or greater 10-year CVD risk in their 60s or 70s and may gain more benefit by continuing aspirin use than persons at lower risk might gain by initiating aspirin use.</p>\r\n<h3>How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?</h3>\r\n<p>Aspirin&rsquo;s mechanism of action to promote CVD prevention is well known. At lower doses, aspirin is an irreversible cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1) enzyme inhibitor. At higher doses, aspirin also inhibits COX-2. Aspirin reduces the risk for atherothrombosis through the inhibition of platelet function (through COX-1 inhibition) and has been used widely for the prevention of CVD events, particularly for secondary prevention.<sup>32</sup> The COX-1 enzyme is also responsible for producing a variety of prostaglandins that protect the gastrointestinal mucosa.<sup>33</sup> By inhibiting this enzyme, aspirin use can promote gastrointestinal bleeding.34 The mechanism for the possible antineoplastic effects of aspirin is not as well understood.<sup>14</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from October 12 to November 8, 2021. In response to public comment, the USPSTF wants to restate that the focus of this recommendation is the use of aspirin for the primary prevention of CVD and not for other indications. This recommendation only applies to persons who do not have a history of CVD, signs or symptoms of CVD, or other conditions for which aspirin may be indicated. Persons who are currently taking aspirin and have questions about why they are taking it, or whether they should continue or discontinue aspirin use, should discuss these questions with their clinician. Persons who are taking aspirin should not discontinue using it without consulting their clinician. For persons who are deciding with their clinician whether to continue or discontinue taking aspirin for primary prevention, clinicians may want to consider that person&rsquo;s age, level of CVD risk and bleeding risk, preferences, and reasons for taking aspirin.</p>\r\n<p>In response to public comment, the USPSTF clarified language about its assessment of the precision of CVD risk assessment and added information on factors that can be considered by clinicians and patients as they engage in shared decision-making about the initiation of aspirin use. Information on the evidence the USPSTF reviewed on the effect of aspirin on CRC incidence and mortality and how it considered the findings from the ASPREE trial can also be found in the Supporting Evidence section of this recommendation. Also, in response to public comment, the USPSTF wants to note that it did not review the emerging evidence on the effect of aspirin on COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.</p><h2>Research Needs and Gaps</h2><p>More research is needed to evaluate the following.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Improving the accuracy of CVD risk prediction in all racial and ethnic and socioeconomic groups.</li>\r\n<li>The gastrointestinal bleeding risk associated with aspirin use in populations representative of the US primary CVD prevention population.</li>\r\n<li>Characterizing the distribution of patient preferences across the spectrum of cardiovascular risk after patients are informed about the benefits and harms of aspirin.</li>\r\n<li>The effects of low-dose aspirin use on CRC incidence and mortality over the long term (10 to 20 years and longer) in primary prevention populations and in the context of current CRC screening practices.</li>\r\n</ul><h2>Figure.

There are no validated screening tools to determine which children are at higher risk for dental caries; however, a number of individual factors elevate risk. Higher prevalence and severity of dental caries are found among low-income and certain racial and ethnic (eg, Black and Mexican American) populations.<sup>1</sup> Risk factors for dental caries in children are multifactorial. Biological risk factors include cariogenic bacteria, developmental defects of tooth enamel, and low saliva flow rates. Social determinants of health (nonbiological factors) that are associated with increased caries risk include access to dental care, low socioeconomic status, personal and family oral health history, dietary habits (especially frequent intake of dietary sugars in foods and beverages), fluoride exposure, and oral hygiene practices.<sup>1,7,8</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Interventions to Prevent Dental Caries</h3>\r\n<p>Oral fluoride supplementation prevents dental caries in patients with deficient water fluoridation (&lt;0.6 parts fluoride per million parts water [ppm F]).<sup>9-11</sup> Topical fluoride is applied as a varnish with a small brush in young children (typically available as 5% sodium fluoride [2.26% fluoride]). The use of topical fluoride for prevention of caries is off-label.<sup>12-15</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Timing and Dosage</h3>\r\n<p>No studies specifically addressed the dosage and timing of oral fluoride supplementation in children with inadequate water fluoridation.</p>\r\n<p>No studies directly assessed the appropriate ages at which to start and stop the application of fluoride varnish. However, given the mechanism of action of this intervention, benefits are likely to accrue starting at the time of primary tooth eruption. In studies, fluoride varnish was most commonly administered as 5% sodium fluoride, every 6 months.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Additional Tools and Resources</h3>\r\n<p>There are several related tools and resources that may help clinicians implement this recommendation:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The Community Preventive Services Task Force recommends fluoridation of community water sources to reduce dental caries.<sup>16</sup></li>\r\n<li>The Community Preventive Services Task Force recommends school-based dental sealant delivery programs to prevent caries.<sup>17</sup></li>\r\n<li>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&rsquo;s Oral Health resources include &ldquo;My Water&rsquo;s Fluoride,&rdquo; a tool to find information about a local water system&rsquo;s fluoridation status.<sup>18</sup></li>\r\n<li>The Health Resources and Services Administration&rsquo;s website contains various oral health program resources, including the &ldquo;Bright Futures: Oral Health&ndash;Pocket Guide, 3rd edition,&rdquo; an overview of oral health prevention and interventions (<a href=\"https://mchb.hrsa.gov/maternal-child-health-topics/child-health\">https://mchb.hrsa.gov/maternal-child-health-topics/child-health</a>).<sup>19</sup></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>\r\n<p>In deciding whether to routinely perform screening examinations for dental caries in children from birth to age 5 years, clinicians should consider the following.</p>\r\n<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>\r\n<p>Dental caries is a common chronic disease that can cause pain and diminished quality of life.<sup>4</sup> According to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, the prevalence of dental caries increased from 24% to 28% between 1988-1994 and 1999-2004; the prevalence was approximately 23% from 2011 to 2016.<sup>5</sup> Seventeen percent of children living below the poverty threshold had untreated caries in 2011 to 2014. Dental-related concerns lead to the loss of more than an estimated 50 million school hours each year.<sup>3</sup><em>&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n<h4>Potential Harms</h4>\r\n<p>Primary care screening examinations for dental caries in children from birth to age 5 years are noninvasive and not likely to cause serious harms.<em>&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n<h4>Current Practice</h4>\r\n<p>A 2009 study demonstrated that only about half of pediatricians reported examining the teeth of more than half of their patients aged 0 to 3 years, and few (4%) reported regularly applying fluoride varnish.<sup>20</sup></p><h2>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h2><p>This is an update of the 2014 USPSTF recommendation statement, in which the USPSTF similarly recommended that primary care clinicians prescribe oral fluoride supplementation starting at age 6 months for children whose water supply is deficient in fluoride (B recommendation) and that primary care clinicians apply fluoride varnish to the primary teeth of all infants and children starting at the age of primary tooth eruption (B recommendation). The USPSTF found insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of routine screening examinations for dental caries performed by primary care clinicians in children younger than 5 years (I statement).<sup>21</sup></p>","other":"<h2>Supporting Evidence</h2><h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF commissioned a systematic review<sup>1,22</sup> to update its 2014 recommendation on screening and interventions to prevent dental caries in children younger than 5 years. The review focused on screening for caries, assessment of risk for future caries, and the effectiveness of various interventions (eg, caregiver/guardian oral health education, preventive medication, or referral to a dental health care professional) that have possible benefits in preventing caries. The USPSTF limited its consideration of caries screening and prevention by primary care clinicians to infants and preschool-aged children. The rationale for this decision was that primary care clinicians are more likely than dental health care professionals to have contact with children younger than 5 years in the US; this situation changes as children reach school age and beyond as opportunities to provide dental services in school settings become available. In addition, as children grow older, dental professionals use sealants rather than fluoride varnish. As such, the USPSTF limited its review of the evidence of preventive interventions for dental caries to this age group. This recommendation should not be construed to imply that preventive interventions for dental caries should cease after age 5 years.</p>\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening</h3>\r\n<p>One good-quality cohort study (n = 258) in children younger than 36 months found that a primary care pediatrician examination after 2 hours of training was associated with a sensitivity of 0.76 and specificity of 0.95 for identifying a child with 1 or more cavities, a sensitivity of 0.49 and specificity of 0.99 for identifying a tooth with a cavity, and a sensitivity of 0.63 and specificity of 0.98 for identifying children in need of a dental referral, compared with a pediatric dentist evaluation.<sup>1,22</sup> A fair-quality study in 110 children aged 18 to 36 months found that an oral examination by a pediatrician had a sensitivity of 1.0 and a specificity of 0.87 for identifying nursing caries.<sup>1,22</sup></p>\r\n<p>One fair-quality study (n = 1681) found that a novel caries risk assessment tool administered by health visitor nurses in children age 1 year was associated with sensitivity of 0.53 and specificity of 0.77 for predicting any dentin lesions at age 4 years and sensitivity of 0.65 and specificity of 0.69 for predicting presence of 3 or more dentin lesions.<sup>1,22</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Screening</h3>\r\n<p>No studies compared clinical outcomes between children younger than 5 years who were screened and not screened for dental caries by primary care clinicians.</p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Screening</h3>\r\n<p>No studies reported harms of screening in children younger than 5 years who were screened and not screened for dental caries by primary care clinicians.</p>\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Preventive Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF considered 15 trials (2 good quality and the rest fair quality). The number of participants ranged from 123 to 2536 (total N = 9541). Trials were conducted in the US, Europe, Brazil, China, and Iran, and 2 trials were in Aboriginal communities in Australia and Canada. The mean age of enrolled children was 1 year to younger than 2 years in 6 trials and 2 years to younger than 5 years in 7 trials; 1 trial did not report mean age but enrolled children aged 6 months to 5 years.<sup>1,22</sup> Three trials were conducted in preschool or daycare settings and the others were conducted in clinics. Fourteen trials evaluated children classified as higher risk based on low socioeconomic status, high community prevalence of caries, high baseline caries burden (based on high proportion of children with caries at baseline), or low rates of oral health behaviors (eg, tooth brushing with fluoride toothpaste).<sup>1,22</sup></p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found 1 randomized trial and 4 nonrandomized trials that compared dietary fluoride supplementation with no supplementation in settings with a water fluoride level less than 0.6 ppm F and found decreased caries incidence. The percentage reduction in incidence ranged from 48% to 72% for primary teeth and 51% to 81% for primary tooth surfaces.<sup>1,22</sup></p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found 15 trials (n = 9541) that demonstrated that topical fluoride was associated with decreased caries increment (13 trials; n = 5733; mean difference, &ndash;0.94 [95% CI, &ndash;1.74 to &ndash;0.34]; <em>I</em><sup>2</sup> = 86%) and decreased likelihood of incident caries (12 trials; n=8177; risk ratio, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.66 to 0.95]; <em>I</em><sup>2</sup> = 79%; absolute risk difference, &ndash;7% [95% CI, &ndash;12% to &ndash;2%]) vs placebo or no varnish.<sup>1,22</sup> The majority of the trials were conducted in higher-risk populations or settings.<sup>1,22</sup> &ldquo;High risk&rdquo; was defined by low socioeconomic status, high caries burden, or suboptimal oral health practices (eg, inadequate tooth brushing). There was no difference in benefits of topical fluoride related to whether trials were conducted in settings with adequate fluoridation.<sup>1,22</sup> Evidence on other preventive interventions was limited (ie, xylitol and silver diamine fluoride).<sup>1,22</sup></p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no studies that directly evaluated the effect of referral by a primary care clinician to a dental health care professional on caries incidence. One fair-quality retrospective cohort study (n = 19,888) and 1 fair-quality observational study (n = 11,394) of children enrolled in Medicaid found no difference in rates of subsequent dental procedures between earlier and later first preventive dental visits among children with no caries at baseline.<sup>1,22</sup> Four fair-quality observational studies (n = 61,194) of children enrolled in Medicaid found that patients receiving a preventive dental visit were more likely to receive subsequent caries treatment than patients who saw a primary care clinician. However, the results were subject to confounding because children who saw a dental health care professional might have had a greater indication for dental services. The studies were also not designed to determine the referral source or effects of dental referral from primary care vs no referral.<sup>1,22</sup></p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found limited evidence on educational or counseling interventions. One new fair-quality trial (n = 104) found that oral health education for mothers of caries-free children aged 12 to 36 months was associated with reduced risk of incident dental caries vs usual care at 6 months (13.5% vs 34.7%; risk ratio, 0.39 [95% CI, 0.18 to 0.85]).<sup>1,22</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Preventive Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>Severe fluorosis (for example, as demonstrated by discoloration and pitted or rough enamel surface of the teeth) is uncommon, with a prevalence of less than 2%.<sup>1,22</sup> Nineteen observational studies showed an association between ingestion of systemic fluoride in early childhood and enamel fluorosis of permanent teeth.<sup>1,22</sup> Four trials (n = 4141) found no differences in risk of fluorosis or any other adverse event between fluoride varnish and placebo or no varnish.<sup>1,22</sup></p>\r\n<h3>How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?</h3>\r\n<p>Systemic fluoride becomes incorporated into tooth structures during their formation. If fluoride is ingested repeatedly during tooth development, it is deposited throughout the tooth surface and provides protection against caries. Topical fluoride treatments, such as varnishes, help protect teeth that are already present. In this method, fluoride is incorporated into the surface layer of the teeth, making them more resistant to decay. Systemic fluoride also provides some measure of topical effects, as it is found in the saliva and bathes the teeth. Thus, providing both systemic and topical fluoride to children during tooth development fits with the biological understanding of the protective actions of fluoride against dental decay. All children with erupted teeth can potentially benefit from the periodic application of fluoride varnish, regardless of the levels of fluoride in their water. Although the evidence to support fluoride varnish is drawn from higher-risk populations, the provision of fluoride varnish to all children is reasonable because the prevalence of risk factors is high in the US population.<sup>23-25</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from May 11, 2021, to June 7, 2021. Several respondents shared concerns about risk of fluoride toxicity and barriers to primary care clinician fluoride prescriptions, including knowledge of local water fluoridation status. In response, the USPSTF added timing and dosage information to the Practice Considerations section and updated the Harms of Preventive Interventions section. The USPSTF also expanded the Additional Tools and Resources section to include a tool from the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention that may aid clinicians in identifying the amount of fluoride in a local water system. Comments were also received requesting that the USPSTF recommend that primary care clinicians provide other interventions such as health education. The USPSTF describes the evidence it reviewed on health education in the Supporting Evidence section.</p><h2>Research Needs and Gaps</h2><p>More studies are needed that address the following:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Research is needed to validate the accuracy and utility of caries risk assessment instruments for use in primary care settings and to determine how referral of young children for dental care by primary care clinicians affects caries outcomes.</li>\r\n<li>Further research would also be helpful to confirm the benefits of fluoride varnish among lower-risk children.</li>\r\n<li>Research is needed to understand the benefit or harm of routine screening by primary care clinicians on caries outcomes in children younger than 5 years.</li>\r\n<li>Future studies on risk assessment and preventive interventions should enroll sufficient numbers from certain racial and ethnic populations (eg, Black and Hispanic children) to understand the benefits and harms of interventions in these specific groups.</li>\r\n<li>Research is needed to identify effective preventive measures in economically disadvantaged children.</li>\r\n<li>Research is needed to identify effective oral health educational and counseling interventions for parents and caregivers/guardians of young children.</li>\r\n<li>Studies are also needed on the benefits and harms of silver diamine fluoride for the prevention of caries in young children.</li>\r\n</ul><h2>Recommendations of Others</h2><p>The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that pediatricians perform oral health risk assessments on all children at every routine well-child visit beginning at age 6 months. The AAP also recommends fluoride varnish application according to the AAP/Bright Futures Periodicity Schedule (applied at least once every 6 months for all children and every 3 months for children at high risk for caries) and dietary fluoride supplements for all children who do not have an adequate supply of fluoride in their primary drinking water. The AAP recommends a first dental visit by age 1 year.<sup>25-27</sup></p>\r\n<p>The American Dental Association recommends that children be seen by a dentist within 6 months of eruption of the first tooth and no later than age 12 months. It also recommends 2.26% fluoride varnish for children younger than 6 years who are at risk for developing dental caries.<sup>28</sup> The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that fluoride supplements may be best prescribed to children at high risk for dental caries whose drinking water lacks adequate fluoridation.<sup>24</sup></p>\r\n<p>The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry states that fluoride dietary supplements should be considered for children at risk for caries who drink fluoride-deficient (&lt;0.6 ppm F) water. It also states that children at increased risk for caries should receive a professional fluoride treatment (eg, 5% sodium fluoride varnish or 1.23% acidulated phosphate fluoride) every 6 months.<sup>29,30</sup></p>","topic":"Prevention of Dental Caries in Children Younger Than 5 Years: Screening and Interventions","keywords":"Cavities|Caries|Tooth decay|Prevent Cavities|Prevent Caries|Prevent Tooth decay|Fluoride|Fluoride varnish|Oral health","pubDate":"2021-12-07","categories":["10"],"tool":["375","382","381","380","379","378","377","376"]},"453":{"topicType":"Counseling","topicYear":2022,"uspstfAlias":"healthy-lifestyle-and-physical-activity-for-cvd-prevention-adults-without-known-risk-factors-behavioral-counseling","specific":[1979],"title":"Healthy Diet and Physical Activity for Cardiovascular Disease Prevention in Adults Without Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors: Behavioral Counseling Interventions","rationale":"<h2>Importance</h2><p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes heart disease, myocardial infarction, and stroke, is the leading cause of death in the US.<sup>1-3</sup> By 2035, nearly half of US adults are anticipated to have some form of CVD.<sup>4</sup> A large proportion of CVD cases can be prevented by addressing modifiable risk factors, including smoking, obesity, diabetes, elevated blood pressure or hypertension, dyslipidemia, lack of physical activity, and unhealthy diet.<sup>2,4</sup> Adults who adhere to national guidelines for a healthy diet<sup>5</sup> and physical activity<sup>6</sup> have lower rates of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality than those who do not; however, many US adults do not consume healthy diets or engage in physical activity at recommended levels.<sup>7,8</sup> All persons, regardless of their CVD risk status, can gain health benefits from healthy eating behaviors and physical activity.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<p>Important disparities in diet and physical activity exist across the US population.<sup>7-9</sup> Non-Hispanic Black adults report consuming lower amounts of fruits and vegetables than White adults.<sup>8,10</sup> Persons of lower socioeconomic status report less consumption of fruits and vegetables and lower levels of physical activity than those of higher socioeconomic status.<sup>10-12</sup> Adults with lower educational attainment report exercising less than those with higher educational attainment.<sup>13</sup> Race is often a proxy for exposure to systemic racism, a known source of inequities in social determinants of health.<sup>14,15</sup> Social determinants of health and systemic racism contribute to differences in healthy diet and physical activity by influencing healthy food availability and physical activity barriers and opportunities.<sup>7,8,16,17</sup> For example, while obstacles to pedestrian walking exist across US racial and ethnic groups and income levels,<sup>16</sup> Hispanic/Latino adults and non-Hispanic Black adults report more barriers (eg, animals or crime) to safe walking than White adults.<sup>18</sup></p><h2>USPSTF Assessment of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h2><p>The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) concludes with moderate certainty that behavioral counseling interventions have a <strong>small net benefit</strong> on CVD risk in adults without CVD risk factors.</p>\r\n<p>See <a href=\"#tab1\">Table 1</a> for more information on the USPSTF recommendation rationale and assessment.

The US Department of Health and Human Services recommends that adults 18 years or older engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity per week in addition to engaging in strengthening activities at least twice per week.<sup>6</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Behavioral Counseling Interventions and Implementation Considerations</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF recommends selectively offering or providing behavioral counseling interventions to patients based on clinician professional judgment and patient preferences.<sup>19</sup> Behavioral counseling interventions may promote physical activity, healthy diet, reducing sedentary time, or some combination thereof. Common dietary counseling advice promotes increased consumption of fruits, vegetables, and fiber; reduced consumption of saturated fats, sodium, and sugar-sweetened beverages; or both.<sup>1</sup> Patient-tailored approaches to enhance skills with reading food labels, preparing healthy meals, and recognizing appropriate caloric intake and portion size are often used.<sup>1</sup> Physical activity counseling often encourages patients to gradually increase aerobic activity (walking is often emphasized) to achieve at least 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) per week of equivalent moderate-intensity activity.<sup>1</sup> Reducing sedentary time aims to limit time spent engaging in low-energy behaviors while awake such as sitting or reclining while watching television or using a computer.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<p>Primary care clinicians can deliver in-person behavioral counseling interventions or refer patients to other settings. Interventions can be delivered individually, in a group, or both, with or without follow-up (telephone calls or emails), or delivered remotely through a combination of print materials, telephone calls, technology-based activities, or some combination thereof. Typical counseling techniques include behavioral change techniques such as goal setting, problem solving, and self-monitoring; approaches including motivational interviewing principles or portions of the &ldquo;5 A&rsquo;s&rdquo; model (assess, advise, agree, assist, and arrange) are common. A wide range of specially trained professionals, including but not limited to physicians, nurses, registered dietitians, nutritionists, exercise specialists, physical therapists, master&rsquo;s- and doctoral-level counselors trained in behavioral methods (eg, psychologists), lifestyle coaches, and community health workers can deliver these interventions. Intensity or interaction time with a clinician may range from 30 minutes to 6 hours over 6 months or longer.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<p>In determining whether behavioral counseling interventions are appropriate, patients and clinicians should consider the following.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Persons who are interested and ready to make behavioral changes may be most likely to benefit from behavioral counseling.</li>\r\n<li>Higher-intensity counseling interventions may vary in availability and feasibility in clinical settings.</li>\r\n<li>Adoption of healthy behavior advice may be increased by tailoring behavioral counseling to consider patient motivations and goals, activity level and ability, circumstances, preferences, and overall health status,<sup>23</sup> as well as availability of healthy eating establishments, grocery stores, parks, sidewalks, bicycle trails, safe/pleasant walking paths close to home or workplace; traffic; public transportation; crime; and pollution levels.<sup>7,8,10-13,16,24</sup></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Additional Tools and Resources</h3>\r\n<p>Several related tools and resources may help clinicians implement this recommendation and assist with uptake of behavioral counseling in specific communities.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) leads Active People, Healthy Nation, a national initiative with a goal of increasing physical activity for 27 million Americans by 2027; resources include strategies to increase physical activity for all, including considerations in persons with disabilities, and tools for action (<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/activepeoplehealthynation/index.html\">https://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/activepeoplehealthynation/index.html</a>).<sup>25</sup></li>\r\n<li>The CDC and the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services co-lead Million Hearts, a national initiative aimed toward preventing 1 million heart attacks and strokes within 5 years (<a href=\"https://millionhearts.hhs.gov/index.html\">https://millionhearts.hhs.gov/index.html</a>).<sup>26</sup></li>\r\n<li>The Health Equity Resource Toolkit for State Practitioners Addressing Obesity Disparities, provided by the CDC, is available at <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpao/health-equity/state-health-equity-toolkit/pdf/toolkit.pdf\">https://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpao/health-equity/state-health-equity-toolkit/pdf/toolkit.pdf</a>.

The review evaluated the benefits and harms of behavioral counseling interventions to promote healthy behaviors in adults without CVD risk factors. The scope was similar to that of the prior systematic review.</p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Counseling to Change Behavior and Outcomes</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF included 113 randomized clinical trials in its review (n = 129,993), most of which were conducted in the US (60 trials).<sup>1,38</sup> All trials reported at least 6 months of follow-up, and many (63 trials) reported 12 months or longer.<sup>1,38</sup> Most trials (73 trials) included men and women.<sup>1,38</sup> The mean age of participants ranged widely, from 18.5 to 79.5 years.<sup>1,38</sup> The mean BMI of trial participants across studies was in the overweight range (27.8).<sup>1,38</sup> Sixty-nine trials reported participant race and ethnicity.<sup>1,38</sup> Of these, most participants were White persons; in 17 trials, Asian persons, Black persons, Hispanic/Latino persons, or Native American/American Indian persons comprised more than two-thirds of participants.<sup>1,38</sup> Most intervention groups focused on physical activity (48.1%), healthy diet (19.1%), or both (32.5%). Delivery mode varied widely; 52.9% of trials included at least 1 in-person counseling session, whereas 42.7% of trials involved sessions delivered completely remotely.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found sufficient evidence that behavioral counseling interventions for a healthy diet, physical activity, or both were associated with modest increases in physical activity levels and some improvements in dietary health behaviors.<sup>1,38</sup> The analysis included 109 trials (n = 125,878) that reported the effect of behavioral counseling interventions on diet, physical activity, or sedentary health behaviors.<sup>1,38</sup> On average, participants of physical activity interventions (87 trials) increased physical activity by approximately 33 minutes per week (95% CI, 21.9 to 44.2) and had higher odds of meeting physical activity recommendations after 6 to 12 months (pooled odds ratio, 1.41 [95% CI, 1.18 to 1.67]) compared with participants in the control group.<sup>1,38</sup> Participants of healthy diet interventions (45 trials) increased fruit and vegetable intake (mean difference, 1.11 servings per day [95% CI, 0.41 to 1.81]) and fiber intake (standardized mean difference, 0.24 [95% CI, 0.05 to 0.43]) and decreased saturated fat intake (standardized mean difference, &minus;0.53 [95% CI, &minus;0.78 to &minus;0.27]) compared with participants in the control group.<sup>1,38</sup> The USPSTF found little evidence of the effectiveness of sedentary behavior interventions.<sup>1,38</sup> Overall, sedentary behavior interventions did not demonstrate statistically significant differences in sedentary behaviors in participants compared with control groups.<sup>1,38</sup></p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found sufficient evidence that behavioral counseling interventions for a healthy diet, physical activity, or both were associated with lower blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and adiposity measures (BMI, weight, and waist circumference) after 6 to 12 months.<sup>1,38</sup> The analysis included 43 trials (n = 77,965) reporting the effect of healthy diet and physical activity behavioral counseling interventions on intermediate outcomes such as blood pressure or adiposity measures.<sup>1,38</sup> Diet and physical activity interventions were associated with lower systolic blood pressure (&minus;0.8 mm Hg [95% CI, &minus;1.30 to &minus;0.31]), diastolic blood pressure (&minus;0.42 mm Hg [95% CI, &minus;080 to &minus;0.04]), LDL-C level (&minus;2.20 mg/dL [95% CI, &minus;3.80 to &minus;0.60]), and adiposity-related outcomes such as weight (&minus;1.07 kg [95% CI, &minus;1.62 to &minus;0.52]), BMI (&minus;0.32 [95% CI, &minus;0.51 to &minus;0.13]), and waist circumference (&minus;0.81 cm [95% CI, &minus;1.32 to &minus;0.30]).<sup>1,38</sup> Generally, high-intensity interventions (&gt;360 minutes) were associated with greater changes in intermediate outcomes, specifically lower LDL-C and adiposity measures.<sup>1,38</sup></p>\r\n<p>Observational evidence from large prospective studies and individual participant data meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies demonstrates that small changes in intermediate outcomes (ie, lower blood pressure) were associated with small reductions in risk of cardiovascular-related mortality and all-cause mortality.<sup>39,40</sup></p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found little direct evidence on the effectiveness of behavioral counseling interventions on all-cause mortality, CVD-related mortality, CVD events (such as myocardial infarction or stroke), or quality of life.<sup>1,38</sup> In studies, CVD-related fatal and nonfatal events were rare, limiting robust analysis, with few group differences.<sup>1,38</sup> A variety of self-reported quality of life measures were reported in 15 trials; group differences were generally very small and of unclear clinical significance.<sup>1,38</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Counseling to Change Behavior</h3>\r\n<p>Of the 113 trials reviewed by the USPSTF, only 23 (n = 12,452) specifically reported on harms or lack of harms of behavioral counseling interventions.<sup>1,38</sup> Overall, harms were rare, and there were no statistically significant differences reported between intervention participants and control groups on any adverse events, serious adverse events, musculoskeletal injuries, or falls.<sup>1,38</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from January 18, 2022, to February 14, 2022. Several respondents requested additional tools to aid clinicians and patients; in response, the USPSTF added materials containing strategies to encourage healthy lifestyles and updated language in the recommendation statement. The recommendation statement includes links to resources (eg, The Community Guide) that may assist primary care linkages needed to implement this recommendation. In addition, the USPSTF calls for additional research into effective primary care&ndash;community connections and clinical training to support delivering in-person behavioral counseling and referring patients for behavior counseling in other settings.</p>\r\n<p>Comments requested additional detail to identify patients who could benefit from behavioral counseling; the USPSTF recommends that professional judgment and patient preference guide clinician decision-making for behavioral counseling interventions in persons without known risk factors. The role of risk assessment in the delivery of behavioral counseling is addressed in a separate recommendation for persons with known CVD risk.<sup>21</sup> Comments requested clarification on which types of professionals could provide behavioral counseling. The USPSTF recognizes and clarified that multiple types of professionals, both medical and nonmedical, can deliver behavioral counseling interventions. Comments also requested more detail to identify barriers to healthy lifestyle engagement in certain populations; the USPSTF calls for more research on evidenced-based interventions that can benefit all potential users.</p><h2>Research Needs and Gaps</h2><p>The USPSTF identified several gaps in the evidence where more research is needed.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Studies should enroll enough participants from populations disproportionately affected by CVD to understand the benefit of physical activity and dietary behavioral counseling interventions in these populations. Culturally appropriate and tailored intervention research may help reduce disparities related to cardiovascular health.</li>\r\n<li>Future research should elucidate best practices for clinicians and patients to navigate known environmental and structural barriers to healthy diet and physical activity toward effective interventions that support persons of all ages and abilities. Primary care&ndash;feasible interventions with strong linkages between clinical and community settings may help effectively implement healthy behavior interventions.</li>\r\n<li>Future research should identify best practices to improve clinician skills in delivering in-person behavioral counseling and referring patients to other settings for behavioral counseling.</li>\r\n<li>Future research should ensure that patient-reported quality of life outcomes related to cardiovascular health are consistently measured and reported.</li>\r\n<li>Future research should validate and standardize dietary intake and physical activity instruments in collection and reporting. Additionally, standardization of digital interventions, apps, and supports could benefit implementation of remote or in-person behavioral counseling interventions.</li>\r\n<li>Future research should design and test interventions to reduce sedentary behavior. The recent increase in working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic may present an opportunity to perform research on effective interventions that reduce sedentary time.</li>\r\n<li>Future research that is adequately powered and of sufficient follow-up duration is needed in patients without known CVD risk.</li>\r\n</ul><h2>Recommendations of Others</h2><p>The American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines to prevent CVD emphasize a team-based approach, with consideration of the social determinants of health that affect patients to guide clinical decisions. The guidelines recommend healthy diet consumption along with 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity physical activity.<sup>41</sup> The American College of Sports Medicine and the AHA recommend that clinicians provide behavioral counseling on physical activity to all adults regardless of chronic conditions or risk factors. In 2018, they co-launched the Exercise is Medicine initiative, calling for clinicians to assess and promote physical activity for all patients.<sup>42</sup> The American Academy of Family Physicians supports the 2017 USPSTF recommendation on this topic.<sup>43</sup> The AHA recommends physical activity assessment and promotion in health care settings for all adult patients to prevent CVD.<sup>44</sup></p>","topic":"Healthy Diet and Physical Activity for Cardiovascular Disease Prevention in Adults Without Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors: Behavioral Counseling Interventions","keywords":"behavior therapy|counseling risk factor reduction and behavior change intervention|healthy diet|physical activity|exercise|heart disease risk factors|obesity|diet|cardiovascular disorder prevention","pubDate":"2022-07-26","categories":["5","4"],"tool":["383","393","392","391","293","299","298","387","386","385","384"]},"454":{"topicType":"Screening","topicYear":2022,"uspstfAlias":"atrial-fibrillation-screening","specific":[1950],"title":"Atrial Fibrillation: Screening","rationale":"<h2>Importance</h2><p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia.

Atrial fibrillation can be persistent or paroxysmal, and symptomatic or asymptomatic. As implantable cardiac devices and the use of portable or wearable cardiac monitoring devices have become more common, a new category of AF, called subclinical AF, has emerged. Subclinical AF refers to device-detected AF that is asymptomatic and not clinically apparent. It may be detected by intracardiac, implantable, or wearable cardiac monitors.<sup>8,9</sup> The duration of subclinical AF can vary, ranging from a few seconds to more than 24 hours.<sup>9</sup> Atrial fibrillation burden refers to the amount or percentage of time that is spent in AF. Atrial fibrillation burden is often described as low or high, although there is no exact definition or consensus about what constitutes low vs high AF burden. Clinical AF is known to increase stroke risk,<sup>3</sup> but the stroke risk associated with subclinical AF, particularly low-burden or short-duration AF, is less well understood.<sup>9,10</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>Although the USPSTF did not find sufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening, several technologies have been proposed for screening for AF. ECG records the electrical activity of the heart and can be performed using 12 leads, fewer than 12 leads, or a single lead. Several other medical devices (eg, automated blood pressure cuffs or pulse oximeters) have been designed with algorithms to detect an irregular heartbeat, which may or may not be AF. Several consumer-oriented devices, such as smartwatches and smartphone apps, are available that aim to detect an irregular heart rhythm using ECG technology or photoplethysmography.<sup>2</sup> It is important to note that the USPSTF considers pulse palpation to be routine or usual care.</p>\r\n<p>Different intensities (eg, frequencies, intervals, and durations) of screening for AF are also being studied. Screening can be performed once, for example, by using ECG or a device with an AF detection algorithm at a clinician visit. Screening can also be performed intermittently on multiple occasions, for example, by having a patient briefly record their heart rhythm using a portable device several times a day or several times a week for a period of time; or continuously (eg, by having a patient wear a portable monitoring device for several days or weeks). The USPSTF categorizes these as 1-time screening strategies, intermittent screening strategies, and continuous screening strategies, respectively. Continuous screening strategies yield the longest overall duration of screening. Intermittent or continuous screening may be more likely to detect AF but also may be more likely to detect paroxysmal AF that occurs infrequently or is of short duration.<sup>10</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Treatment or Intervention</h3>\r\n<p>Treatment of AF generally has 2 components&mdash;managing symptomatic arrhythmia and preventing stroke. Symptomatic arrhythmia can be managed by controlling the heart rate to minimize symptoms (usually through medication) or by restoring a normal rhythm. Methods for restoring normal rhythm include electrical or pharmacologic cardioversion and surgical or catheter ablation.</p>\r\n<p>To reduce the risk of stroke, anticoagulants are used. Oral anticoagulants include warfarin (a vitamin K antagonist) and target-specific anticoagulants, also known as direct oral anticoagulants.<sup>11</sup> In general, guidelines recommend anticoagulant therapy for persons at high risk of stroke.<sup>12,13</sup> It is important to note that stroke risk stratification instruments (eg, CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc [congestive heart failure, hypertension, age &ge;75 years {doubled}, diabetes, stroke/transient ischemic attack/thromboembolism {doubled}, vascular disease {prior myocardial infarction, peripheral artery disease, or aortic plaque}, age 65-74 years, sex category {female}]) were developed from populations of patients with clinically diagnosed, not screen-detected, AF.<sup>10</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>\r\n<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>\r\n<p>Atrial fibrillation is the most common type of cardiac arrhythmia. In the US, estimates of the prevalence of clinical AF ranged from 2.7 to 6.1 million in 2010.<sup>14</sup> The prevalence of AF is highly correlated with age. Its prevalence increases from 0.2% among adults younger than 55 years to 10% among those 85 years or older.<sup>1</sup> Additional risk factors for AF include diabetes, previous cardiothoracic surgery, smoking, prior stroke, underlying heart disease, hypertension, sleep apnea, obesity, alcohol/drug use, ECG features such as left ventricular hypertrophy and left atrial enlargement, and hyperthyroidism.<sup>15</sup> The primary rationale for screening for AF in asymptomatic persons is to initiate oral anticoagulant medications in persons at sufficiently high risk to prevent a thromboembolic event.</p>\r\n<p>Patients with clinical AF not receiving anticoagulant therapy have an increased risk of stroke,<sup>3</sup> and strokes associated with AF tend to be more severe than strokes attributed to other causes.<sup>16</sup> Atrial fibrillation does not always cause symptoms, and for approximately 20% of patients who have a stroke associated with AF, stroke is the first sign that they have the condition.<sup>17</sup> However, the current evidence is insufficient for the USPSTF to recommend for or against screening for AF. Additionally, the stroke risk associated with subclinical AF, particularly subclinical AF of shorter duration (less than several to 24 hours) or lower burden (amount or percentage of time spent in AF), as might be detected by some screening approaches, is uncertain, and the duration of subclinical AF that might warrant anticoagulant therapy is unclear.<sup>9,10</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Potential Harms</h4>\r\n<p>The performance of ECG or use of portable or wearable rhythm monitoring devices is not associated with significant harm, although abnormal test results may cause anxiety. Misinterpretation of a screening test result may lead to misdiagnosis and unnecessary treatment. Treatment of AF can include anticoagulant therapy for stroke prevention, which is associated with a risk of bleeding, and pharmacologic, surgical, endovascular (eg, ablation), or combined treatments to control heart rhythm or heart rate. In addition, ECG may detect other abnormalities (either true- or false-positive results) that can lead to further testing and treatments that have the potential for harm.</p>\r\n<h4>Current Practice</h4>\r\n<p>Few data are available on the current prevalence of screening for AF with ECG or other modalities in the US.</p>\r\n<h3>Additional Tools and Resources</h3>\r\n<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides information on the prevention of heart disease at <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/prevention.htm\">https://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/prevention.htm</a> and useful information about AF at <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/atrial_fibrillation.htm\">https://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/atrial_fibrillation.htm</a>.</p>\r\n<p>The Million Hearts initiative provides information on improving cardiovascular health and preventing myocardial infarction and stroke at <a href=\"https://millionhearts.hhs.gov/index.html\">https://millionhearts.hhs.gov/index.html</a>.</p>\r\n<h3>Other Related USPSTF Recommendations</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF has made recommendations on many factors related to the prevention of cardiovascular disease and stroke, including screening for high blood pressure,<sup>18</sup> use of statins,<sup>19</sup> counseling on smoking cessation,<sup>20</sup> and counseling to promote a healthy diet and physical activity.<sup>21</sup></p><h2>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h2><p>This recommendation replaces the 2018 USPSTF recommendation statement on screening for AF with ECG. In 2018, the USPSTF concluded that the evidence was insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of using ECG to screen for AF.<sup>22</sup> For the current recommendation statement, the USPSTF expanded its review to include other screening tests in addition to ECG. The USPSTF again concludes that the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for AF in asymptomatic adults.</p>","other":"<h2>Supporting Evidence</h2><h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n<p>To update its 2018 recommendation statement, the USPSTF commissioned a systematic review<sup>2,23</sup> of the evidence on the benefits and harms of screening for AF in older adults, the accuracy of screening tests, the effectiveness of screening tests to detect previously undiagnosed AF compared with usual care, and the benefits and harms of anticoagulant therapy for the treatment of screen-detected AF in older adults.</p>\r\n<h3>Detection of Previously Undiagnosed AF</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed 9 studies on the accuracy of potential screening tests for AF. Two studies<sup>24,25</sup> of single-lead ECG devices with automated AF detection algorithms used as a 1-time screening test reported sensitivities of 0.88 and 0.99 and specificities of 1.0 and 0.76 when compared with a single 12-lead ECG interpreted by a cardiologist. One study<sup>26</sup> of a 6-lead ECG device with AF detection reported sensitivity of 0.95 and specificity of 0.99 vs a single 12-lead ECG interpreted by a cardiologist. Three studies reported 5 comparisons of 2 different oscillometric blood pressure monitoring devices with automated AF detection compared with a 12-lead ECG interpreted by a cardiologist.<sup>25,27,28</sup> In 4 of the comparisons, sensitivity ranged from 0.92 to 1.0 and specificity ranged from 0.90 to 0.95. In the fifth comparison, sensitivity for 1 of the devices was reported as 0.3 and specificity as 0.97.<sup>27</sup> The reason for the lower sensitivity reported in that study is uncertain.</p>\r\n<p>One study of a 72-hour continuous Holter monitor compared with an insertable cardiac monitor<sup>29</sup> found a sensitivity of 1.0 when considering cases of AF detected during the 72-hour monitoring period covered by both devices. Over the entire duration of insertable cardiac monitoring (mean, 588 days), several additional cases of subclinical paroxysmal AF were detected, giving an overall sensitivity of 0.12 for the 72-hour Holter monitor. The specificity of Holter monitoring was 1.0. Data on the accuracy of screening tests reported in or calculated from randomized clinical trials of screening are discussed below. It is important to note that estimates of sensitivity and specificity for any given test to detect AF may vary depending on the reference standard used (12-lead ECG interpreted by a cardiologist or an insertable cardiac monitor) and with the duration of the reference standard measurement.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found 4 randomized clinical trials that compared different 1-time screening approaches for the detection of AF with usual care or no screening.<sup>30-36</sup> The mean age of participants in these trials was 74 to 76 years. Of these trials, only 1, the Screening for Atrial Fibrillation in the Elderly (SAFE) trial, found a statistically significant increased detection rate of AF (0.6% absolute increase) when comparing no intervention with ECG; however, there was no difference between clinician reminders for pulse palpation (considered usual care by the USPSTF) and screening with ECG in the detection of new cases of AF.<sup>31</sup> Fidelity to the intervention was low to modest in all 4 studies, ranging from 11% to 69%.<sup>2</sup></p>\r\n<p>Two of these trials reported on measures of accuracy of screening tests. The SAFE trial reported that the sensitivity of ECG interpreted by a general practitioner compared with 12-lead ECG interpreted by a cardiologist ranged from 0.80 to 0.85, and specificity ranged from 0.86 to 0.92.<sup>30,32</sup> The Detecting and Diagnosing Atrial Fibrillation trial did not report sensitivity or specificity.<sup>36</sup> However, in that trial, if the screening test result is considered positive if any of its components (pulse palpation, oscillometric blood pressure measurement with automated AF detection, and single-lead ECG with automated AF detection) were positive, the positive predictive value was 6% and the negative predictive value was 100%.<sup>2,23</sup></p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found 2 trials that used an intermittent screening approach and 2 trials that used a continuous screening approach. The mean age in these trials ranged from 72 to 80 years. The Assessment of Remote Heart Rhythm Sampling Using the AliveCor Heart Monitor to Screen for Atrial Fibrillation (REHEARSE-AF) trial (n = 1001) randomized participants to twice-weekly screening with a single-lead, handheld ECG for 30 seconds or to no screening for 12 months.<sup>37</sup> STROKESTOP randomized more than 28,000 persons aged 75 or 76 years in a defined geographical region in Sweden to an index ECG at baseline, followed by 2 weeks of intermittent handheld single-lead ECG monitoring; follow-up was a median of 6.9 years.<sup>38</sup> REHEARSE-AF found a statistically significant 2.8% absolute risk increase in detection of AF for screening vs no screening at 12 months. STROKESTOP found a statistically significant 1.0% absolute risk increase in detection of AF at 6 months after screening, a difference that was maintained through 7 years of follow-up but which was no longer statistically significant (21.3% vs 20.3%; <em>P</em> = .28). Approximately 12% of persons enrolled in STROKESTOP had known AF at baseline, and only 13% of AF cases detected after the intervention in the screening group were new cases not known at baseline.</p>\r\n<p>The mHealth Screening to Prevent Strokes (mSToPS) trial (n = 2659) randomized participants to screening with 2 14-day episodes of continuous ambulatory ECG monitoring with a patch 3 months apart or to delayed screening.<sup>39</sup> SCREEN-AF randomized 856 participants to a similar intervention, with the addition of a home blood pressure monitor with automated AF detection to be used twice daily during each 2-week ECG monitoring period. The mean age of participants in this study was 80 years, and all were required to have hypertension.<sup>40</sup> These 2 trials reported statistically significant absolute risk increases of 3% and 4.8% in detection of AF for screening vs no screening or delayed screening. The USPSTF found no trials that compared screening for AF with consumer-oriented devices vs no screening.<sup>2,23</sup></p>\r\n<p>SCREEN-AF also reported on a measure of screening accuracy. It found that screening with an oscillometric blood pressure monitor with an AF detection feature twice daily over a total of 4 weeks had a sensitivity of 0.35 (95% CI, 0.15-0.59) and specificity of 0.81 (95% CI, 0.77-0.85) compared with continuous ECG monitoring over the same 4 weeks.<sup>40</sup> The low sensitivity observed for the intermittent blood pressure monitor is likely because a continuous ECG is better suited for identifying paroxysmal AF.</p>\r\n<p>Intermittent or continuous screening approaches may be more likely to detect short episodes of nonpersistent AF. The mSToPS trial reported that the longest individual episode of AF detected during its total of 28 days of monitoring was less than 5 minutes in 7.2% of participants, 5 minutes to 6 hours in 55%, 6 to 24 hours in 25%, and more than 24 hours in 13%.<sup>39</sup> In the SCREEN-AF trial the longest individual episode of AF detected was 5 minutes or less in 13% of participants, more than 5 minutes to 6 hours in 43%, more than 6 to 24 hours in 30%, and more than 24 hours in 13%.<sup>40</sup> It is uncertain to what degree short episodes of subclinical AF increase stroke risk, and the duration of subclinical AF that warrants anticoagulant therapy is unclear.<sup>9,10</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found 3 trials, REHEARSE-AF,<sup>37</sup> SCREEN-AF,<sup>40</sup> and STROKESTOP,<sup>38</sup> that compared screening with no screening and that reported on health outcomes; however, only STROKESTOP was powered to detect health outcomes. STROKESTOP reported no significant difference in ischemic stroke (the originally specified primary study outcome), systemic embolism, or all-cause mortality in the invitation to screening group compared with the control group at a median follow-up of 6.9 years (hazard ratio, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.83-1.01] for ischemic stroke; 1.10 [95% CI, 0.76 to 1.59] for systemic embolism; and 0.96 [95% CI, 0.92-1.01] for all-cause mortality). The study reported that the rate of a composite end point consisting of ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, systemic embolism, bleeding leading to hospitalization, and all-cause mortality was significantly lower in the invitation to screening group (5.45 events/100 person-years) compared with the control group (5.68 events/100 person-years), with an unadjusted hazard ratio of 0.96 (95% CI, 0.92-1.00; <em>P</em> = .045). STROKESTOP has several limitations, including: the composite end point includes both benefits and harms; the primary trial outcome was originally specified as ischemic stroke in 2012 but was subsequently changed to this composite end point in 2017; and, approximately 12% of persons enrolled in STROKESTOP had known AF at baseline, and approximately 11% had a history of transient ischemic attack, stroke, or systemic embolism. The other 2 studies, REHEARSE-AF<sup>37</sup> and SCREEN-AF,<sup>40</sup> found no significant difference in health outcomes (stroke, transient ischemic attack, systemic embolism, and death) between the screening and no screening groups, although they were not designed or powered to detect these outcomes and events were rare.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no trials that reported on the benefits of anticoagulant therapy in screen-detected populations. Several trials reported on the benefits of anticoagulant therapy for clinical AF. In a pooled analysis of 5 trials, warfarin treatment over a mean of 1.5 years was associated with reductions in all-cause mortality (pooled relative risk [RR], 0.68 [95% CI, 0.50-0.93]; 2415 participants), ischemic stroke (pooled RR, 0.32 [95% CI, 0.20-0.51]), and moderately to severely disabling stroke (pooled RR, 0.38 [95% CI, 0.19-0.78]) compared with the control group.<sup>2,23</sup> A network meta-analysis of 21 studies found that all anticoagulant treatments (warfarin or direct oral anticoagulants) were associated with a lower risk of outcomes such as stroke, systemic embolism, and all-cause mortality compared with placebo or control groups.<sup>41</sup></p>\r\n<p>Trials of anticoagulant treatment enrolled participants with clinical, usually long-standing, persistent AF; none focused on participants who were detected by screening.<sup>2,23</sup> As discussed above, the extent to which short episodes of subclinical (ie, asymptomatic or device-detected) AF increase stroke risk is uncertain, and the duration or burden of AF that warrants anticoagulation therapy is unclear.<sup>9,10</sup> Thus, the applicability of treatment benefits to screen-detected populations, particularly those with short-duration or low-burden AF, is uncertain.</p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Screening and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>Several of the randomized clinical trials discussed above also reported on the harms of screening for AF. In STROKESTOP, the rates of hemorrhagic stroke and hospitalization for major bleeding did not significantly differ between the invitation to screening group and the control group.<sup>38</sup> In the SAFE study, anxiety levels were not significantly different between participants randomized to ECG screening vs pulse palpation reminders. Participants who had a positive screening result had higher mean anxiety scores compared with those who had a negative result, although most did not have clinically meaningful levels of anxiety symptoms.<sup>30</sup> The mSToPS trial reported incidentally detected, potentially actionable arrhythmias other than AF in 70 participants (2.6% of participants), although the balance of benefits or harms of these findings is unknown.<sup>39</sup> Another potential harm of screening is ECG misinterpretation, leading to false-positive results and possibly unnecessary treatment.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed several trials, systematic reviews, and an observational study that reported on harms associated with anticoagulant therapy. Anticoagulant therapy was associated with an increased risk of bleeding, including major bleeding, extracranial bleeding, intracranial bleeding, and minor bleeding events, although the increased risk was not statistically significant for all outcomes.<sup>2,23</sup> Similar to the body of evidence on the benefits of anticoagulant treatment, the studies reporting on harms were focused on persons with clinical, usually long-standing, persistent AF; none focused on screen-detected populations.<sup>2,23</sup> However, the harms of anticoagulant therapy in a screen-detected population would likely be similar; thus, the USPSTF assesses that this evidence is applicable to screen-detected AF.</p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from April 20, 2021, to May 17, 2021. Several comments agreed with the USPSTF recommendation. In response to comments, the USPSTF wants to clarify that the I statement is not a recommendation against screening for AF; it indicates that the evidence is insufficient to recommend either for or against screening. The USPSTF also wants to highlight that it considers pulse palpation to be usual care, as noted in the Practice Considerations and Detection of Previously Undiagnosed AF sections. Some comments noted that the inclusion age for studies on the benefits and harms of screening for AF was lowered to age 50 years for the current recommendation, compared with age 65 years in the prior recommendation. The USPSTF did this to be inclusive of all potential evidence on screening for AF. Lowering the inclusion age was not intended to dilute the evidence in older adults in any way, nor did it. Some comments suggested adding specific research gaps, such as determining the optimal strategy for screening, the optimal populations to screen, or the association between subclinical AF or AF detected on consumer devices and stroke risk. In response, the USPSTF specified understanding the stroke risk associated with AF detected by consumer devices as a research need, and notes that screening with consumer-oriented technologies was an included intervention in the current review. The other suggested research gaps are largely captured by the USPSTF&rsquo;s current research needs and gaps. The USPSTF added the recently published SCREEN-AF and STROKESTOP studies to those it reviewed for this recommendation.</p><h2>Research Needs and Gaps</h2><p>More studies are needed that address the following.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Randomized trials enrolling asymptomatic persons that directly compare screening with usual care and that assess both health outcomes and harms are needed to understand the balance of benefits and harms of screening for AF.

This recommendation focuses on screening for MDD and does not address screening for other depressive disorders, such as minor depression or dysthymia.</p>\r\n<h3>Condition Definitions</h3>\r\n<p>The <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (Fifth Edition) defines MDD as having at least 2 weeks of mild to severe persistent feelings of sadness or a lack of interest in everyday activities. Depression can also present with irritability, poor concentration, and somatic issues (eg, difficulty sleeping, decreased energy, and changes in appetite).<sup>5</sup></p>\r\n<p>Suicidal behavior includes suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and suicide completion. Suicidal ideation refers to thinking about, considering, or planning suicide. Suicide attempts refer to nonfatal, self-directed, and potentially injurious behavior that is intended to result in death. Suicide completion is defined as a death caused by self-inflicted injurious behavior with the intent to result in death because of the behavior.<sup>6-8</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF recommends screening for MDD in all adolescents but notes that several risk factors might help identify patients at higher risk. Risk factors for depression include a combination of genetic, biological, and environmental factors such as a family history of depression, prior episode of depression, and other mental health or behavioral problems. Individual factors (eg, age, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, or genetic predisposition) also may serve as risk factors across mental health conditions.<sup>1,2</sup> Other psychosocial risk factors include childhood abuse or neglect, exposure to traumatic events, bullying (either as perpetrators or as victims), adverse life events, early exposure to stress, maltreatment, and an insecure parental relationship.<sup>1,2</sup></p>\r\n<p>Recent cohorts of Black children and adolescents have reported a higher prevalence of suicide rates, increase in suicide attempts, and greater increases in the prevalence of depression than in the past.<sup>9-11</sup> Reasons for this increase may be due to multiple factors such as socioeconomic status, family structure, neighborhood effects, and childhood adversity. Adverse childhood experiences influence the likelihood of experiencing mental health conditions such as depression. Adverse childhood experiences may result from a complex interaction of familial, peer, or societal factors.&nbsp; These adverse childhood experiences may be blatant or subtle (eg, microaggressions) but are potentially traumatic events that, in the context of historic trauma, structural racism, and biopsychological vulnerability, can worsen mental health outcomes.<sup>12</sup> Combined with lower engagement with mental health services, adverse childhood experiences can result in high levels of unmet need in Black youth.<sup>13-17</sup> Similar patterns of historic trauma, adverse childhood experiences, and substance abuse may also explain higher rates of mental health disorders in Native American/Alaska Native youth.<sup>18</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>Screening instruments for depression are based on either patient or caregiver reporting. Depression screening instruments typically assess common symptoms related to depression. The most commonly used screening instrument in clinical practice is the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Other screening instruments that may be longer but have been studied include the full PHQ modified for adolescents (PHQ-A) and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale.</p>\r\n<p>Many depression screening instruments also include at least 1 item related to suicidal ideation. Instruments designed to screen across mental health conditions may be more efficient than instruments targeting a single condition. However, these instruments take longer to administer, thereby reducing feasibility in primary care settings. They also may be less accurate for specific conditions.<sup>1,2</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Screening Intervals</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no evidence on appropriate or recommended screening intervals for depression, and the optimal interval is unknown. Repeated screening may be most productive in adolescents with risk factors for depression. Opportunistic screening may be appropriate for adolescents, who may have infrequent health care visits.</p>\r\n<h3>Treatment or Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>Treatment options for MDD in children and adolescents include pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, collaborative care, psychosocial support interventions, and complementary and alternative medicine approaches.<sup>1,19,20</sup> Different types of psychotherapy are used in treating children and adolescents with depression, but cognitive behavioral therapy and interpersonal therapy have the most evidence supporting their effectiveness.<sup>21-23</sup> Although several antidepressants are approved for treating MDD in adult populations, fluoxetine is the only medication approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in treating MDD in children 8 years or older; escitalopram is approved to treat MDD in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years.<sup>19,20</sup> Fluoxetine and escitalopram, both selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, are sometimes combined with psychotherapy. The FDA has issued a boxed warning for antidepressants, recommending that patients of all ages who start antidepressant therapy be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, or unusual changes in behavior.</p>\r\n<h3>Implementation</h3>\r\n<p>Many screening tools are available to identify depression in children and adolescents, and some have been used in primary care. The number of items in each tool, the administrative time required to complete them, and the appropriate ages for screening vary. An initial screening may be followed by additional questioning or a formal diagnostic interview.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF recognizes that inadequate support and follow-up may result in treatment failures or harms, as also indicated by the FDA boxed warning. Adequate systems and clinical staff are needed to ensure that patients are screened and, if they screen positive, are appropriately diagnosed and treated with evidence-based care. These essential functions can be provided through a wide range of clinician types and settings, including primary care, referral to specialty setting, or collaborative care in both settings. Collaborative care is a multicomponent, health care system&ndash;level intervention that uses care managers to link primary care clinicians, patients, and mental health specialists.<sup>24</sup> Additional resources on collaborative care can be found below in the Additional Tools and Resources section.</p>\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statements</h3>\r\n<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>\r\n<p>Little is known about the prevalence of MDD in children 11 years or younger. Early onset is associated with worse outcomes.</p>\r\n<p>Suicide is the second-leading cause of death among youth aged 10 to 19 years.<sup>3</sup> The rate of suicide deaths is highest among Native American/Alaska Native youth and lowest among Black youth, compared with White youth.<sup>25,26</sup> Native American/Alaska Native youth die by suicide at a rate of 2.5 deaths per 100,000 persons (younger youth) and 16.1 deaths per 100,000 persons (older youth).<sup>1,2</sup> White children and adolescents have a similar rate of dying by suicide compared with Black children and adolescents of the same age (1.3 vs 1.4 deaths per 100,000 persons for White and Black children, respectively); however, the suicide rate among White adolescents is nearly double the rate among Black adolescents (8.4 deaths per 100,000 persons and 4.2 deaths per 100,000 persons, respectively).<sup>1,2,25,26</sup> Important risk factors for suicide are mental health disorders and adverse childhood experiences (eg, family history of suicide or mental health disorders, previous suicide attempts, life stressors, history of trauma, parent-child conflict, or legal problems).<sup>27</sup> Suicide risk varies by gender or sex and type of behavior. Male youth had a higher rate of suicide completion (17.9 deaths per 100,000 persons) than female youth (5.4 deaths per 100,000 persons); however, the risk of suicide attempts was greater in female youth than in male youth.<sup>28</sup> Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer adolescents demonstrate higher rates of suicidal ideation and attempts compared with heterosexual adolescents.<sup>29</sup> Treatments to reduce risk for suicide attempt include psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy (eg, antidepressants, antipsychotics, and mood stabilizers). However, it is unclear how effective these therapies are in reducing suicide attempts in children and adolescents who do not have recognized signs or symptoms of being suicidal.</p>\r\n<h4>Potential Harms</h4>\r\n<p>Potential harms of screening for MDD in young children or for suicide risk in children and adolescents of any age include false-positive screening results that lead to unnecessary referrals (and associated time and economic burden), treatment, labeling, anxiety, and stigma. Psychological interventions are likely to have minimal harms.<sup>1,2</sup> The use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in children is associated with harms, specifically risk for suicidality.</p>\r\n<h4>Current Practice</h4>\r\n<p>Evidence is limited on the implementation of routine mental health screening in the US. A survey of primary care physicians found that 76% believe in the importance of talking to adolescent patients about their mental health; however, only 46% said that they always asked their patients about their mental health.<sup>30</sup></p>\r\n<p>Screening instruments for suicide risk usually include components related to current suicidal ideation, self-harm behaviors, and assessments of past attempts and behaviors. Although several screening tools for suicide risk have been developed, the accuracy of these screening tools compared with clinical interview is uncertain. Data on how often primary care clinicians screen for suicide risk in children and adolescents are lacking.</p>\r\n<h3>Additional Tools and Resources</h3>\r\n<p>The Community Preventive Services Task Force recommends targeted school-based cognitive behavioral therapy programs to reduce depression and anxiety symptoms (<a href=\"https://www.thecommunityguide.org/findings/mental-health-targeted-school-based-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-programs-reduce-depression-anxiety-symptoms\">https://www.thecommunityguide.org/findings/mental-health-targeted-school-based-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-programs-reduce-depression-anxiety-symptoms</a>).</p>\r\n<p>The Community Preventive Services Task Force recommends individual cognitive behavioral therapy for symptomatic youth who have been exposed to traumatic events, based on strong evidence of effectiveness in reducing psychological harm (<a href=\"https://www.thecommunityguide.org/findings/violence-psychological-harm-traumatic-events-among-children-and-adolescents-cognitive-individual\">https://www.thecommunityguide.org/findings/violence-psychological-harm-traumatic-events-among-children-and-adolescents-cognitive-individual</a>).</p>\r\n<p>The Community Preventive Services Task Force recommends group cognitive behavioral therapy for symptomatic youth who have been exposed to traumatic events, based on strong evidence of effectiveness in reducing psychological harm (<a href=\"https://www.thecommunityguide.org/findings/violence-psychological-harm-traumatic-events-among-children-and-adolescents-cognitive-group\">https://www.thecommunityguide.org/findings/violence-psychological-harm-traumatic-events-among-children-and-adolescents-cognitive-group</a>).</p>\r\n<p>The Community Preventive Services Task Force recommends collaborative care for the management of depressive disorders (<a href=\"https://www.thecommunityguide.org/findings/mental-health-and-mental-illness-collaborative-care-management-depressive-disorders\">https://www.thecommunityguide.org/findings/mental-health-and-mental-illness-collaborative-care-management-depressive-disorders</a>).</p>\r\n<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has additional information on depression in childhood (<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/childrensmentalhealth/depression.html\">https://www.cdc.gov/childrensmentalhealth/depression.html</a>).</p>\r\n<p>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality has a playbook on how to develop a shared care plan (<a href=\"https://integrationacademy.ahrq.gov/products/playbooks/behavioral-health-and-primary-care/implementing-plan/develop-shared-care-plan\">https://integrationacademy.ahrq.gov/products/playbooks/behavioral-health-and-primary-care/implementing-plan/develop-shared-care-plan</a>).</p>\r\n<p>The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services provides resources on the collaborative care model (<a href=\"https://www.chcs.org/resource/the-collaborative-care-model-an-approach-for-integrating-physical-and-mental-health-care-in-medicaid-health-homes\">https://www.chcs.org/resource/the-collaborative-care-model-an-approach-for-integrating-physical-and-mental-health-care-in-medicaid-health-homes</a>).</p>\r\n<p>In 2021, the US Surgeon General issued a Call to Action that seeks to progress toward full implementation of the National Strategy for Suicide Prevention (<a href=\"https://www.sprc.org/resources-programs/surgeon-generals-call-action-implement-national-strategy-suicide-prevention\">https://www.sprc.org/resources-programs/surgeon-generals-call-action-implement-national-strategy-suicide-prevention</a>).</p>\r\n<p>The Suicide Prevention Resource Center, supported by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, offers various resources on suicide prevention (<a href=\"https://www.sprc.org/\">https://www.sprc.org/</a>).</p>\r\n<h3>Other Related USPSTF Recommendations</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF has recommendations on mental health topics pertaining to children and adolescents, including screening for anxiety<sup>31</sup> and screening for illicit drug<sup>32</sup> and alcohol use.<sup>33</sup></p><h2>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h2><p>This recommendation replaces the 2014 USPSTF recommendation statement on screening for suicide risk in adolescents<sup>34</sup> and the 2016 recommendation statement on screening for MDD in children and adolescents.<sup>35</sup> A separate review on screening for suicide risk in adults is currently in progress. Previously, the USPSTF concluded that there was insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for suicide risk in adolescents, adults, and older adults in primary care (I statement).<sup>34</sup> The USPSTF recommended screening for MDD in adolescents aged 12 to 18 years, noting that screening should be implemented with adequate systems in place to ensure accurate diagnosis, effective treatment, and appropriate follow-up (B recommendation). The USPSTF also concluded that the current evidence was insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for MDD in children 11 years or younger (I statement).<sup>35</sup> The current recommendation statement is consistent with these previous recommendations.</p>","other":"<h2>Recommendations of Others</h2><p>The Guidelines for Adolescent Depression in Primary Care (GLAD-PC) recommend annual screening for depression in adolescent patients 12 years or older.<sup>39</sup> GLAD-PC is supported by the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, and the American Psychiatric Association. The Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care states that there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening for depression in children or adolescents in primary care settings.<sup>40</sup> The Canadian Task Force is currently updating its guidelines.<sup>40</sup> The American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, and experts from the National Institute of Mental Health released a &ldquo;Blueprint for Youth Suicide Prevention&rdquo; that recommends universal screening for suicide risk in youth 12 years or older; children aged 8 to 11 years should be screened as clinically indicated.<sup>41</sup> The Joint Commission recommends that organizations screen all individuals for suicidal ideation using a validated screening tool.<sup>42</sup></p>","discussion":"<h2>Supporting Evidence</h2><h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF commissioned a systematic review<sup>1,2</sup> to evaluate the benefits and harms of screening, accuracy of screening, and benefits and harms of treatment of MDD and suicide risk in children and adolescents that would be applicable to primary care settings. Studies conducted in inpatient or psychiatric residential facilities or psychiatric emergency departments were excluded.</p>\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found 7 fair-quality studies on accuracy of screening tests for detecting depression (n = 3316). There were no studies of depression screening accuracy in children only; 1 study included children and adolescents younger than 12 years. The other 6 studies were in children and adolescents 12 years or older. Most of the 7 screening instruments assessed are not widely used in clinical practice. The USPSTF did not identify any studies that used the most common screening instrument in clinical practice, the PHQ-9.<sup>1</sup> The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (2 included studies) is also used for screening in practice but does not include items that assess suicidality.<sup>1</sup> Each screening instrument was assessed in only 1 or 2 studies, and results varied by screening instrument and threshold. For studies assessing accuracy of depression screening instruments, sensitivity ranged from 0.59 to 0.94 and specificity ranged from 0.38 to 0.97.<sup>1,2</sup></p>\r\n<p>One study of the PHQ-A demonstrated a sensitivity of 0.73 (95% CI, 0.58 to 0.85) and a specificity of 0.94 (95% CI, 0.91 to 0.96). Based on the accuracy characteristics of the PHQ-A, 58 false-positive results and 8 false-negative results per 1000 screening tests conducted would result at the low end of MDD prevalence (3%), and 53 false-positive results and 30 false-negative results would result at the high end of MDD prevalence (11%).<sup>36-38</sup> Two studies using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale used different thresholds, with sensitivity ranging from 0.59 to 0.85 and specificity ranging from 0.38 to 0.83.<sup>1,2</sup></p>\r\n<p>Only 1 fair-quality study assessing the accuracy of screening for suicide risk in adolescents was found (n = 580), and none were identified in younger age groups. Sensitivity ranged from 0.87 to 0.91 (depending on reference standard used) and specificity was 0.60.<sup>1,2</sup> Other suicide screening tools were excluded from review because the accuracy of these tools could not be ascertained using established USPSTF methodology.</p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no studies that directly evaluated the benefits of screening for depression or suicide risk on health outcomes in screened vs unscreened participants.</p>\r\n<p>Thirteen randomized clinical trials (RCTs) (n = 2156) addressed the benefits of depression treatment. Of these 13 RCTs, 9 evaluated psychotherapy; 2 evaluated pharmacotherapy; 1 evaluated cognitive behavioral therapy, fluoxetine, and their combination; and 1 evaluated collaborative care. Cognitive behavioral therapy was the most common type of psychotherapy evaluated. The mean age of participants was 13 years or older in 10 of the studies; only 3 studies included participants 12 years or younger. Most studies recruited participants through general advertisements or from health systems and clinics; only 1 study specifically targeted recruitment from mental health clinics.<sup>1,2</sup> For pharmacotherapy interventions, the evidence is mostly limited to short-term benefits (typically up to 12 weeks).</p>\r\n<p>Pooled estimates demonstrated that psychotherapy, compared with wait-list controls, treatment as usual, attention control, or placebo, was associated with improved symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory or Beck Depression Inventory II standardized mean difference, &minus;0.58 [95% CI, &minus;0.83 to &minus;0.34]; n = 471; 4 trials; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 0%; Hamilton Depression Scale mean difference, &minus;2.25 [95% CI, &minus;4.09 to &minus;0.41]; n = 262; 3 trials; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 0%). Psychotherapy also demonstrated improvements in clinical response and loss of diagnosis (relative risk, 1.73 [95% CI, 1.00 to 3.00]; n = 395; 4 trials; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 0%). There were no statistically significant differences for other measures.<sup>1,2</sup></p>\r\n<p>Pharmacotherapy, compared with placebo, was associated with statistically significant improvement in symptoms (Children&rsquo;s Depression Rating Scale&ndash;Revised [CDRS-R] pooled mean difference, &minus;3.76 [95% CI, 5.95 to &minus;1.57]; n = 793; 3 trials, <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 49%). Pharmacotherapy also demonstrated benefit for loss of diagnosis (pooled relative risk, 1.20 [95% CI, 1.00 to 1.45]; n = 793; 3 trials; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 0%) and a benefit for functional status (Children&rsquo;s Global Assessment Scale pooled mean difference, 2.60 [95% CI, 0.78 to 4.42]; n = 793; 3 trials; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 0%). There was no significant association between pharmacotherapy and improved remission.<sup>1,2</sup></p>\r\n<p>In 1 study, collaborative care was shown to be associated with statistically significant improved symptoms at 6 months (CDRS-R change, 8.5 [95% CI, &minus;13.4 to &minus;3.6]; <em>P</em> = .001), response by 12 months (odds ratio for &ge;50% reduction in CDRS-R score from baseline, 3.3 [95% CI, 1.4 to 8.2]), and remission (odds ratio for PHQ-9 score &lt;5 at 6 months, 5.2 [95% CI, 1.6 to 17.3]). The study reported no statistically significant benefits on measures of functioning.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<p>Sixteen trials (n = 3034) addressed the benefits of treatment of suicide risk. Suicidal ideation, an intermediate outcome, was measured by the Beck Hopelessness Scale, and a statistically significant difference favoring intervention was found (pooled mean difference, &minus;2.35 [95% CI, &minus;4.06 to &minus;0.65]; n = 644; 4 trials; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 46%), compared with the control.<sup>1,2</sup> However, the clinical significance of how this change on the Beck Hopelessness Scale translates to fewer suicide attempts or completed suicides is not well understood. The 12 remaining trials focused on health outcomes but were underpowered.<sup>1,2</sup> Findings for the health outcomes (eg, suicide deaths, hospitalization or emergency department visits, number of self-harm events, proportion with self-harm events, or functioning) were mixed or not statistically significantly different.<sup>1,2</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Screening and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found 2 studies that evaluated the evidence on the harms of screening for depression or suicide risk on health outcomes in children or adolescents in primary care or primary care&ndash;relevant settings. Two RCTs (n = 2675) compared short-term distress from screening for suicide risk and reported no significant differences between those screened and those not screened.<sup>1,2</sup> No studies reported on harms such as labeling, stigmatization, or overmedication that resulted from screening.</p>\r\n<p>Six trials (n = 1352) and 1 network meta-analysis assessed the harms of depression treatment: 3 evaluated pharmacotherapy; 2 evaluated psychotherapy; 1 evaluated cognitive behavioral therapy, fluoxetine, and their combination; and 1 evaluated collaborative care. Only 1 study included children younger than 12 years.<sup>1,2</sup></p>\r\n<p>The results for pharmacotherapy suggested a higher rate of suicide-related outcomes and withdrawal as a result of adverse events and serious adverse events compared with placebo; the differences were not statistically significant, likely because of a small number of events due to poor reporting. One collaborative care study that evaluated harms had inconsistent results for psychiatric hospitalizations and emergency department visits. The 2 trials of psychotherapy reported inconsistent findings on harms, as did the single trial on collaborative care.<sup>1,2</sup></p>\r\n<p>Two trials (n = 885) reported on suicide risk interventions. There were no significant differences in adverse events reported.<sup>1,2</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from April 12, 2022, to May 9, 2022. In response to comments, the USPSTF has clarified in the Supporting Evidence section that none of the studies it reviewed reported on the potential harms of labeling, stigmatization, and overmedication that are hypothesized to potentially result from screening. Two additional studies were identified but provided no evidence of harm; outcome measures were limited to very short-term measures of distress or emotion. Challenges in implementing screening in primary care and additional information on collaborative care models are provided in the Implementation and Additional Tools and Resources sections. A few comments requested that the USPSTF consider and recommend additional suicide screening tools. The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on the accuracy of these screening tools and clarified that determining the accuracy of these screening tools using established USPSTF methodology was too uncertain for the USPSTF to recommend.</p><h2>Research Needs and Gaps</h2><p>There are several critical evidence gaps.

Older adults are defined as those 65 years or older. This recommendation focuses on screening for MDD and does not address screening for other depressive disorders, such as minor depression or dysthymia.</p>\r\n<h3>Condition Definitions</h3>\r\n<p>The <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (Fifth Edition) defines MDD as having at least 2 weeks of mild to severe persistent feelings of sadness or a lack of interest in everyday activities. Depression can also present with irritability, poor concentration, and somatic complaints (eg, difficulty sleeping, decreased energy, and changes in appetite).<sup>19</sup></p>\r\n<p>Perinatal depression is defined as depressive episodes that occur during pregnancy and the postpartum period (the first 12 months following delivery).<sup>20</sup> In addition to common symptoms of depressive disorders (eg, feeling sad or loss of interest in activities), other symptoms during the perinatal period may include difficulty bonding with the infant, persistent doubt in parenting abilities, and parental thoughts of death, suicide, self-harm, or harm to the infant.<sup>21</sup></p>\r\n<p>Suicidal behavior includes suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and suicide completion. Suicidal ideation refers to thinking about, considering, or planning suicide. Suicide attempts refer to nonfatal, self-directed, and potentially injurious behavior that is intended to result in death. Suicide completion is defined as a death caused by self-inflicted injurious behavior with the intent to cause death.<sup>22</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF recommends screening for depression in all adults regardless of risk factors. Risk factors for depression include a combination of genetic, biological, and environmental factors,<sup>1,23</sup> such as a family history of depression, prior episode of depression or other mental health condition, a history of trauma or adverse life events, or a history of disease or illness (eg, cardiovascular disease).<sup>24-30</sup></p>\r\n<p>Prevalence rates vary by sex, age, race, ethnicity, education, marital status, geographic location, poverty level, and employment status.<sup>1,23</sup> Women have twice the risk of depression compared with men.<sup>31,32</sup> Young adults, multiracial individuals, and Native American/Alaska Native individuals have higher rates of depression.<sup>33</sup></p>\r\n<p>Risk factors for perinatal depression include life stress, low social support, history of depression, marital or partner dissatisfaction, and a history of abuse.<sup>34</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>Many brief tools have been developed that screen for depression and are appropriate for use in primary care. All positive screening results should lead to additional assessments to confirm the diagnosis, determine symptom severity, and identify comorbid psychological problems.</p>\r\n<p>Commonly used depression screening instruments include the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) in various forms in adults, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) in older adults, and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) in postpartum and pregnant persons.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<p>Screening instruments for suicide risk include the Beck Hopelessness Scale, the SAD PERSONS Scale (Sex, Age, Depression, Previous attempt, Ethanol abuse, Rational thinking loss, Social supports lacking, Organized plan, No spouse, Sickness), and the SAFE-T (Suicide Assessment Five-step Evaluation and Triage).<sup>1</sup> Some depression screening instruments, such as the PHQ-9, incorporate questions that ask about suicidal ideation.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Screening Intervals</h3>\r\n<p>There is little evidence regarding the optimal timing for screening for depression; more evidence is needed in both perinatal and general adult populations. In the absence of evidence, a pragmatic approach might include screening adults who have not been screened previously and using clinical judgment while considering risk factors, comorbid conditions, and life events to determine if additional screening of patients at increased risk is warranted. Ongoing assessment of risks that may develop during pregnancy and the postpartum period is also a reasonable approach.</p>\r\n<h3>Treatment or Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>Effective treatment of depression in adults generally includes antidepressant medication or psychotherapy (eg, cognitive behavioral therapy or brief psychosocial counseling), alone or in combination.<sup>1</sup> Clinicians are encouraged to consider the unique balance of benefits and harms in the perinatal period when deciding the best treatment for depression for a pregnant or breastfeeding person.</p>\r\n<h3>Implementation</h3>\r\n<p>Adequate systems and clinical staff are needed to ensure that patients are screened and, if they screen positive, are appropriately diagnosed and treated with evidence-based care or referred to a setting that can provide the necessary care. Inadequate support and follow-up may result in treatment failures or harm, including those indicated by the US Food and Drug Administration boxed warning for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).<sup>1</sup> These essential functions can be provided through a wide range of different arrangements of clinician types and settings, including primary care clinicians, mental health specialists, or both working collaboratively, such as within a collaborative care model.<sup>1,35</sup> Collaborative care is a multicomponent, health care system&ndash;level intervention that uses care managers to link primary care clinicians, patients, and mental health specialists.<sup>1,35</sup> Additional components of support include training and materials to improve clinicians&rsquo; knowledge and skills surrounding diagnosis and treatment of depression, facilitation or improvement of the referral process, and patient-specific treatment materials.<sup>1,35</sup></p>\r\n<p>Potential barriers to screening include clinician knowledge and comfort level with screening, inadequate systems to support screening or to manage positive screening results, and impact on care flow, given the time constraints faced by primary care clinicians. Clinicians should be cognizant of stigma issues associated with mental health diagnoses and should aim to develop trusting relationships with patients, free of implicit bias, by being sensitive to cultural issues.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<p>Clinicians should also be cognizant of the barriers that keep individuals with depression, particularly those identified through screening, from receiving adequate treatment. It is estimated that only 50% of patients with major depression are identified.<sup>36</sup> Only 35% of adults in the US with a depressive disorder receive care within the first year of condition onset.<sup>37</sup> Systemic barriers also exist, including lack of connection between mental health and primary care, patient hesitation to initiate treatment, and nonadherence to medication and therapy.<sup>38,39</sup></p>\r\n<p>Racism and structural policies have contributed to wealth inequities in the US,<sup>40</sup> which can affect mental health services in underserved communities.<sup>1</sup> For example, wealth inequities may result in barriers to receiving mental health services, such as treatment costs and lack of insurance, which tend to have a greater impact on Black persons and other racial and ethnic groups than on White persons.<sup>41</sup> Black and Hispanic/Latino primary care patients are less likely to be diagnosed with depression or anxiety compared with White patients.<sup>37,42-44</sup> Black and Hispanic/Latino patients are also less likely to receive mental health services than Asian American or White patients.<sup>45,46</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>\r\n<h4><em>Potential Preventable Burden</em></h4>\r\n<p>Suicide is the second-leading cause of death in individuals aged 10 to 34 years.<sup>2</sup> Eighty-three percent of individuals who die by suicide were seen in primary care in the previous year; 24% had any mental health diagnosis in their medical records in the month prior to death.<sup>47</sup></p>\r\n<p>Factors resulting in increased risk for suicide attempts include severe psychological distress, major depressive episodes, alcohol use disorder, marital status of being divorced or separated, or being unemployed. Important risk factors for suicide deaths include previous suicide attempts (strongest predictor of future suicide death), mental health disorders and substance abuse, family history of suicide or mental health disorders, life stressors, family violence or abuse, incarceration or legal problems, certain medical conditions, chronic pain, or being a military veteran.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<p>Suicide risk varies by age, sex, and race and ethnicity.<sup>1</sup> Men are more than 3 times more likely to die by suicide than women.<sup>48</sup> The highest suicide rates for women occur between the ages of 45 and 54 years, while for men the highest rates occur after age 65 years.<sup>48</sup> In the US, the highest suicide rates occur among White adults, followed by Native American/Alaska Native adults. Between 2014 and 2019, suicide rates increased in Asian or Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander individuals by 16% and in Black individuals by 30%.<sup>49</sup></p>\r\n<h4><em>Potential Harms</em></h4>\r\n<p>Although evidence on harms of screening for suicide risk is limited, potential harms of screening include false-positive screening results that may lead to unnecessary referrals and treatment (and associated time and economic burden), labeling, anxiety, and stigma. Studies of suicide prevention interventions generally demonstrate that they are no more effective than usual care<sup>1</sup>; however, 1 large pragmatic trial demonstrated an increased risk of self-harm with a dialectical behavioral therapy skills-building intervention.<sup>50</sup></p>\r\n<h4><em>Current Practice</em></h4>\r\n<p>Evidence is limited on the implementation of routine mental health screening in primary care settings in the US. No information on screening rates for depression and suicide risk in the US was identified. Suicide screening likely occurs as part of depression screening within settings that screen for suicide risk.</p>\r\n<p>Screening instruments for suicide risk usually include components related to current suicidal ideation, self-harm behaviors, and assessments of past attempts and behaviors. It is unknown how often primary care clinicians detect elevated suicide risk in adults. Thirty-six percent of US primary care clinicians discussed suicide in encounters with patients showing symptoms of major depression or adjustment disorders or seeking antidepressants.<sup>51</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Additional Tools and Resources</h3>\r\n<p>The Community Preventive Services Task Force (CPSTF) has several recommendations related to mental health conditions in adults. The CPSTF recommends collaborative care for managing depressive disorders. It recommends both home-based depression care and depression care management in primary care clinics for older adults. The CPSTF also recommends mental health benefits legislation in increasing appropriate utilization of mental health services for persons with mental health conditions. More information about the CPSTF and its recommendations on depression interventions is available on its website (<a href=\"https://www.thecommunityguide.org\">https://www.thecommunityguide.org</a>).</p>\r\n<p>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration maintains a national registry of evidence-based programs and practices for substance abuse and mental health interventions (<a href=\"https://www.samhsa.gov/resource-search/ebp\">https://www.samhsa.gov/resource-search/ebp</a>) that may be helpful for clinicians looking for models of how to implement depression screening. The Suicide Prevention Resource Center, supported by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, offers various resources on suicide prevention (<a href=\"https://sprc.org/\">https://sprc.org/</a>).</p>\r\n<p>In 2021, the US Surgeon General released a Call to Action that seeks progress toward full implementation of the National Strategy for Suicide Prevention (<a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/surgeongeneral/reports-and-publications/suicide-prevention/index.html\">https://www.hhs.gov/surgeongeneral/reports-and-publications/suicide-prevention/index.html</a>).</p>\r\n<p>Perinatal Psychiatry Access Programs are population-based programs that aim to increase access to perinatal mental health care (<a href=\"https://www.umassmed.edu/lifeline4moms/Access-Programs/\">https://www.umassmed.edu/lifeline4moms/Access-Programs/</a>). These programs build the capacity of medical professionals to address perinatal mental health and substance use disorders.</p>\r\n<h3>Other Related USPSTF Recommendations</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF has recommendations on other mental health topics pertaining to adults, including screening for anxiety,<sup>52</sup> preventive counseling interventions for perinatal depression,<sup>53</sup> screening for unhealthy drug use,<sup>54</sup> and screening and behavioral counseling interventions for alcohol use.<sup>55</sup></p>","other":"<h2>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendations</h2><p>This recommendation will replace the 2014 USPSTF recommendation statement on screening for suicide risk in adults<sup>56</sup> and the 2016 recommendation statement on screening for MDD in adults.<sup>57</sup> Previously, the USPSTF concluded that there was insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for suicide risk in adults and older adults in primary care (I statement). The USPSTF recommended screening for MDD in in the general adult population, including pregnant and postpartum persons, noting that screening should be implemented with adequate systems in place to ensure accurate diagnosis, effective treatment, and appropriate follow-up (B recommendation). The current recommendation statement is consistent with these previous recommendations.</p><h2>Supporting Evidence</h2><h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF commissioned a systematic review<sup>1,58</sup> to evaluate the benefits and harms of screening, accuracy of screening, and benefits and harms of treatment of MDD and suicide risk in asymptomatic adults that would be applicable to primary care settings.</p>\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF examined evidence on the most widely used or recommended screening tools for depression: PHQ, any version; CES-D; EPDS for perinatal persons; and GDS for older adults.<sup>1,58</sup></p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found 14 primary studies (n = 8819) and 10 existing systematic reviews (n &asymp; 75 000) on accuracy of screening tests for detecting depression.<sup>1,58</sup> The existing systematic reviews assessed different versions of the PHQ, 2- and 3-item Whooley screening questions, CES-D, and EPDS.<sup>1,58</sup> One study conducted a series of individual patient data meta-analyses to compare several versions of the PHQ with structured or semistructured interviews. In the individual patient data meta-analyses, the PHQ-9 identified 85% of participants with major depression and 85% of those without major depression, at the standard cutoff of 10 or greater, when compared with a semistructured interview reference standard (sensitivity, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.79-0.89]; specificity, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.82-0.87]; 47 studies [n = 11,234]).<sup>1,58</sup></p>\r\n<p>At the standard cutoff of 2 or greater and when compared with a semistructured interview, the PHQ-2 was more sensitive than the PHQ-9, identifying 91% of participants with major depression (sensitivity, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.88-0.94]; 48 studies [n = 11,703]). However, specificity at that cutoff was lower, identifying 67% of participants without depression (specificity, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.64-0.71]; 48 studies [n = 11,703]). The Whooley screening questions and the CES-D demonstrated accuracy comparable with the PHQ-2.<sup>1,58</sup> The accuracy of the EPDS was also similar to that of the PHQ-2, with sensitivity ranging from 81% to 90% and specificity ranging from 83% to 88% at cutoffs of 11 and 12, compared with a fully structured diagnostic interview.<sup>1,58</sup></p>\r\n<p>The 14 primary studies covered multiple versions of the GDS; the GDS-15 was the most common version. In the studies, participants were 55 years or older (mean age, 69-85 years). Fifty percent to 70% of participants were women. Race or ethnicity was reported in only 4 studies. In these 4 studies, patients were primarily White, although 1 study from the UK included only Afro-Caribbean participants.<sup>1,58</sup> The standard cutoff of 5 or greater had an acceptable balance of sensitivity and specificity. In a pooled analysis, the GDS-15 accurately identified participants with major depression (sensitivity, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.85-0.98]; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 85.7%; specificity, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.70-0.89]; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 99.2%), with a cutoff score of 5.<sup>1,58</sup></p>\r\n<p>Three studies (n = 1801) assessed screening instruments for suicidal ideation.<sup>1,58-61</sup> Two studies evaluated general adult populations and 1 study evaluated older adults. The study with the most events was limited to older adults.<sup>1,58</sup> Individual screening tests (GDS-15, GDS-SI [GDS&ndash;Suicide Ideation], and SDDS-PC [Symptom Driven Diagnostic System for Primary Care]) were not examined in more than 1 study. Most screening instruments reported sensitivity and specificity above 0.80 for at least 1 reported cutoff score.<sup>1,58</sup></p>\r\n<p>None of the studies on the accuracy of screening tests defined optimal screening timing or intervals for either general adult or perinatal populations.</p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>Seventeen screening trials (n = 18,437 participants) directly addressed the benefits of screening for depression on health outcomes. Four trials included unscreened control groups. The remaining trials screened all participants but provided the screening results only to the intervention groups&rsquo; clinicians.<sup>1</sup> Trial participants included adults of all ages and perinatal populations; 6 studies included general adult populations, 4 studies were limited to older adults, 6 studies were limited to postpartum patients (between 2 and 12 weeks postpartum), and 1 study was limited to pregnant patients.<sup>1,58</sup></p>\r\n<p>Nine of the studies were conducted in the US. The remaining studies were conducted in the UK, Hong Kong, and Northern European countries.<sup>1,58</sup> All studies took place in primary care, general practice, obstetrics-gynecology, or other maternal or child wellness settings.<sup>1,58</sup> The mean age of trial participants was 38.2 years. Across all studies, 93% of all participants were women. Women also comprised a majority of participants in studies focused on general adult populations (73% women) and older adults (66% women). Among studies conducted in the US, the proportion of Black participants ranged from 7.1% to 51.2% (6 studies); of Hispanic/Latino study participants, from 4.5% to 59.3% (4 studies); and of White study participants, from 29% to 94.1% (6 studies). Only 1 study reported the percentage of participants of Asian descent, and none reported the percentage who were Native American/Alaska Native.<sup>1,58</sup> Depression outcomes included the proportion of participants meeting criteria for depression or who were above a prespecified depression symptom score (&ldquo;prevalence&rdquo;), the proportion who no longer met criteria for depression or were below a prespecified symptom score (&ldquo;remission&rdquo;), the proportion whose depression symptoms were reduced by a specified amount (&ldquo;response&rdquo;), and mean symptom scores.</p>\r\n<p>The direct evidence from the 17 screening trials demonstrated increased rates of depression remission or scoring below a specified symptom severity threshold after 6 to 12 months in general adult and perinatal populations.<sup>1,58</sup> Screening interventions, most of which also included other care management components, were associated with a lower prevalence of depression or clinically important depressive symptomatology at 6 months postbaseline or postpartum (or the closest follow-up to 6 months) (odds ratio [OR], 0.60 [95% CI, 0.50-0.73]; 8 randomized clinical trials [RCTs] [n = 10,244]; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 0%). Among participants scoring above a predefined symptom level at baseline, screening interventions were associated with a greater likelihood of remission or scoring below a specified level of depression symptomatology (OR, 1.58 [95% CI, 1.23-2.02]; 8 RCTs [n = 2302]; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 0%) after 6 months (or the closest follow-up to 6 months). However, no benefit in symptom severity measures was found (pooled mean difference in change, &minus;1.0 [95% CI, &minus;2.3 to 0.3]; 9 studies [n = 5543]; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 74.4%).<sup>1,58</sup></p>\r\n<p>The evidence in older adult populations demonstrated smaller effects. Four trials examined screening only in older adults and only 1 trial used a depression measure that was specifically designed for older adults. Trials among general adult populations included older adults; however, none of the trials reported subgroup effects by age.<sup>1,58</sup> There was also a lack of evidence on the optimal time to screen or screening intervals.</p>\r\n<p>Forty existing systematic reviews evaluated treatment for depression; 30 (&asymp;346 RCTs [n &asymp; 45,078]) addressed psychological treatment and 10 addressed pharmacologic treatment (&asymp;522 studies [n &asymp; 116,477]). One existing systematic review reported both psychological and pharmacotherapy treatment.<sup>1,58</sup> Psychotherapy treatment improved depression and other health outcomes such as anxiety symptoms, hopelessness, quality of life, and functioning in primary care patients, perinatal populations, and older adults. The broadest analysis (any type of psychotherapy compared with any kind of control condition, measuring the depression outcome immediately after treatment [typically 2-6 months postbaseline]) demonstrated a moderate to large effect on depression (standardized mean difference [SMD], &minus;0.72 [95% CI, &minus;0.78 to &minus;0.67]; 385 studies [N not reported but estimated at &asymp;33,000]). The effect was smaller but still statistically significant when limited to studies in primary care patients (SMD, &minus;0.42 [95% CI, &minus;0.56 to &minus;0.29]; 59 studies [N not reported]).<sup>1,58</sup> Remission and response to treatment were rarely reported. There were limited data for populations according to racial or ethnic group or whether participants were socially or economically disadvantaged. The limited evidence available suggested benefits of psychological treatment in these populations.<sup>1,58</sup></p>\r\n<p>Pooled analyses of antidepressant medications demonstrated increased rates of remission and response to treatment and small but statistically significant reductions in depressive symptom severity in the short term (typically 8 weeks).<sup>1,58</sup> Fluoxetine (117 studies) was associated with a small reduction in symptom severity (SMD, &minus;0.23 [95% CI, &minus;0.28 to &minus;0.19]), an increase in the odds of remission (OR, 1.46 [95% CI, 1.34-1.60]), and an increase in the odds of treatment response (OR, 1.52 [95% CI, 1.40-1.66]).<sup>1,58</sup> Limited evidence was available on the longer-term impact of antidepressants and on the benefits of pharmacologic treatment in older adults and pregnant persons.<sup>1,58</sup></p>\r\n<p>Only 1 short-term RCT (n = 443) examined screening for suicide risk, which was limited to primary care patients who had screened positive for depression.<sup>1,58</sup> This trial reported no statistically significant group differences in suicidal ideation at 2 weeks&rsquo; follow-up, with 1 suicide attempt among all study participants.<sup>1,58</sup></p>\r\n<p>Twenty-three RCTs (n = 22,632) of suicide prevention among persons at increased risk of suicide were included.<sup>1,58</sup> One trial evaluated lithium; the remaining trials studied behavioral interventions. The effectiveness of psychological interventions for suicide prevention on suicide deaths and suicide attempts could not be determined due to the small number of events. One suicide death was reported. Most studies reported 5 or fewer suicide attempts per study group, and the pooled effect was not statistically significant (OR, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.73-1.22]; 12 RCTs [n = 14,573]; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 11.2%).<sup>1,58</sup> Pooled analyses did not demonstrate improvement over usual care for suicidal ideation, self-harm, or depression symptom severity.<sup>1,58</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Screening and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>One depression screening RCT (n = 462) evaluated harms. This trial was among postpartum patients, and no adverse events were reported in the intervention and placebo groups. Across all other depression screening studies that evaluated the benefits of screening, there was no pattern of effects indicating that screening might paradoxically worsen any outcomes the interventions were intending to benefit.<sup>1,58</sup></p>\r\n<p>Four existing systematic reviews (&asymp;63 RCTs [n &asymp; 8466]) addressed the harms of psychotherapy in the general adult and perinatal populations. Psychological interventions with any psychological treatment, self-guided internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy, or guided internet-based interventions did not increase the risk of harm, measured as a worsening of depressive symptoms.<sup>1,58</sup> In 3 existing systematic reviews, the deterioration rates were lower with psychological interventions or did not differ statistically from the control group. In an existing systematic review of older adults, 14 included trials did not report safety data.<sup>1,58</sup></p>\r\n<p>Twenty-two existing systematic reviews (&asymp;522 RCTs and 175 observational studies [n &gt; 9 million]) and 1 cohort study (n = 358,351) addressed the harms of pharmacotherapy in adults of all ages and perinatal persons.<sup>1,58</sup> Two existing systematic reviews assessed perinatal patients, 4 evaluated older adults, and the remaining reviews included adults of any age.<sup>1,58</sup> Pharmacologic agents evaluated included SSRIs and other second-generation antidepressants. Harm outcomes included any adverse events, dropout due to adverse events, serious adverse events, suicide deaths, suicide attempts, and suicidal ideation.<sup>1,58</sup></p>\r\n<p>Pharmacologic treatment was associated with a higher risk of dropout due to adverse events. There was also an increased risk of serious adverse events with SSRI use compared with placebo (OR, 1.39 [95% CI 1.12-1.72]; 44 RCTs [n not reported]; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 0%). The absolute risk of serious adverse events was low, and evidence for specific serious adverse events was limited. There were too few suicide deaths to examine the association between antidepressant use and suicide death. However, RCT and observational evidence demonstrated a small absolute increase in risk of suicide attempts with second-generation antidepressant use among adults up to age 65 years (OR, 1.53 [95% CI, 1.09-2.15] [n = 41,861]; 0.7% of antidepressants users vs 0.3% of placebo users). Evidence of other harmful outcomes (eg, cardiovascular-related, bleeding, mortality, risk of falls, fractures, or dementia) was limited and mostly included observational evidence. Evidence was also almost entirely limited to observational studies for serious harms of pharmacotherapy in pregnant or postpartum persons (eg, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, postpartum hemorrhage, and spontaneous abortion).<sup>1,58</sup></p>\r\n<p>A short-term study (2 weeks&rsquo; follow-up) among primary care patients (n = 443) who screened positive for depression assessed the harms of suicide risk screening.<sup>62</sup> Although absolute scores were higher on 2 of the 3 suicidal ideation measures, compared with no screening, the findings were not statistically significant.<sup>1,58</sup></p>\r\n<p>Two RCTs of suicide prevention treatment reported on harms. There were no differences between groups at follow-up on an instrument developed to evaluate the perceived level of coercion experienced by service users during hospital admission.<sup>63,64</sup> A lithium trial found a higher rate of nonserious adverse events (75.7% with lithium, 69% with placebo; <em>P</em> value not reported) and of serious adverse events (38.8% with lithium, 34.1% with placebo; <em>P</em> value not reported).<sup>64</sup> However, there was no difference in withdrawals due to adverse events (1.2% with lithium, 1.5% with placebo; <em>P</em> value not reported). Treatment trials did not show results indicating paradoxical harms.</p>\r\n<p>One large trial (n = 18,882) assessed 2 suicide prevention interventions among adults with an elevated risk of suicide based on the PHQ-9 (question 9).<sup>65</sup> A care management intervention, compared with usual care, had no impact on the rate of suicide attempts (hazard ratio, 1.07 [97.5% CI, 0.84 to 1.37]; <em>P</em> = .52). A low-intensity online skills training intervention was associated with an increased risk of suicide attempts (hazard ratio, 1.29 [97.5% CI, 1.02 to 1.64]; <em>P</em> = .02).<sup>1,50,58</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from September 20, 2022, to October 17, 2022. In response to comments, the USPSTF added text in the Practice Considerations section to address barriers to screening such as lack of clinician training, time constraints, and lack of systems to ensure adequate follow-up. The USPSTF added language about treatment harms of suicide interventions to the Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement and Supporting Evidence sections. The USPSTF incorporated additional language regarding screening intervals into the Practice Considerations section and highlighted it as an evidence gap. The USPSTF addressed the use of pharmacotherapy in pregnant and postpartum persons in the Practice Considerations section and added a resource to help clinicians in the Additional Tools and Resources section.</p><h2>Research Needs and Gaps</h2><p>More evidence on whether and how screening for suicide risk can improve health outcomes is needed.

pubertal delay; bradycardia; oligomenorrhea; and amenorrhea).</p>\r\n<h3>Definitions of Eating Disorders</h3>\r\n<p>Common eating disorders and their key diagnostic criteria from the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (Fifth Edition)<sup>2</sup> include the following.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Anorexia nervosa: Restriction of energy intake relative to requirements, leading to significantly low weight for age, sex, and developmental trajectory; intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat; disturbance in the way body weight or shape is experienced.</li>\r\n<li>Bulimia nervosa: Recurrent episodes of binge eating characterized by eating a larger amount of food than the amount that most persons would eat and a sense of lack of control of overeating during the episode; recurrent inappropriate compensatory behaviors to prevent weight gain (eg, self-induced vomiting and laxative misuse); undue influence of body shape and weight on self-evaluation.</li>\r\n<li>Binge eating disorder: Recurrent episodes of binge eating and marked distress about binge eating episodes.</li>\r\n<li>Other specific feeding and eating disorder: Eating or feeding disturbance (eg, atypical anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, or binge eating disorder of low frequency or limited duration; purging disorder; and night eating syndrome) that causes clinically significant distress or impairment but does not meet the full criteria for the disorders in this diagnostic class; in the published literature, persons meeting criteria for this disorder are often categorized as having a &ldquo;subthreshold&rdquo; diagnosis for another eating disorder based on endorsement of key behaviors (eg, binge eating) that fall short of the required frequency and duration thresholds.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>\r\n<p>Risk factors for eating disorders include various biological, psychological, social, and environmental factors, such as trauma, childhood adversity, perfectionism, rigidity, or social pressure related to appearance.<sup>1,5-7</sup> Various populations are at increased risk for eating disorders, such as athletes, females, and younger adults (aged 18 to 29 years).<sup>1,8,9</sup> Eating disorders also vary by race and ethnicity and sexual orientation and gender identity. White populations have higher rates of anorexia nervosa; bulimia nervosa is more prevalent among Asian, Black, and Hispanic/Latino persons than White persons.<sup>1,2,10</sup> Transgender adolescents and young adults have higher rates of self-reported eating disorder diagnoses than cisgender heterosexual females.<sup>1,11</sup> There is an increased incidence of eating disorders among persons with comorbid psychiatric conditions, including depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, substance use disorders, and anxiety disorders.<sup>1,12</sup> Genetic heritability may also contribute to the risk of developing anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa.<sup>1,6,13,14</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>Assessment of weight, height, and body mass index (BMI) is considered the standard of care in primary care settings, and changes in growth or weight may lead to detection of some eating disorders. For persons without obvious physical symptoms or signs of eating disorders, screening questionnaires are available that could be used in primary care settings, including the Eating Disorder Screen for Primary Care (EDS-PC), Screen for Disordered Eating, and the SCOFF questionnaire. (Some experts do not consider SCOFF an acronym since questions are based on specific terminology from each of the signaling questions [eg, &ldquo;Have you recently lost more than One stone in a 3 month period?&rdquo;].)<sup>1,15</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Treatment or Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>Persons suspected of having an eating disorder are typically referred to specialists for diagnostic evaluations and treatment.<sup>1</sup> Treatment for eating disorders in symptomatic persons generally involves an interdisciplinary approach encompassing psychological/behavioral, medical, and nutritional components. Treatment may vary based on the severity of the disorder. Psychological approaches used include cognitive behavioral therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, and dialectical behavior therapy. Two medications have US Food and Drug Administration approval for treatment of an eating disorder: lisdexamfetamine for binge eating disorder treatment and fluoxetine for bulimia nervosa treatment. Other psychotropic medications are used to treat eating disorder symptoms as well as comorbid psychiatric conditions (eg, depression and anxiety) but are not always indicated. Medical management focuses on addressing physical and medical complications of eating disorders (eg, cardiac instability, musculoskeletal injury, and endocrine function).<sup>1,16,17</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>\r\n<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>\r\n<p>Eating disorders can lead to physical complications affecting many organ systems; complications differ by diagnosis. Complications from anorexia nervosa are attributed to weight loss and malnutrition (eg, low bone density/fractures, symptomatic bradycardia/hypotension, and gastroparesis).<sup>1,18</sup> Binge eating disorder is associated with higher rates of obesity and related metabolic disorders than other eating disorders.<sup>1,19</sup> Bulimia nervosa is associated with complications due to purging, such as cardiovascular problems (eg, arrhythmias and cardiac failure), electrolyte disturbances, pancreatitis, gastric erosions or perforations, dental erosion, and kidney injury.<sup>19</sup> Eating disorders have also been associated with disturbances in cognitive and emotional functioning and psychiatric conditions (ie, mood, anxiety, and substance abuse disorders).<sup>12,20</sup> Persons with eating disorders have higher mortality rates than the general population, particularly those with anorexia nervosa.<sup>21</sup><em>&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n<h4>Potential Harms</h4>\r\n<p>Potential harms of screening questionnaires include false-positive screening results that lead to unnecessary referrals (and associated time and financial costs), treatment, labeling, anxiety, and stigma. Pharmacologic interventions may result in adverse events such as dry mouth, headache, and insomnia (lisdexamfetamine); paresthesia and taste perversion (topiramate); or insomnia, nausea, and tremor (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs]). Psychological interventions are likely to have minimal harms.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Current Practice</h4>\r\n<p>Assessing weight, height, and BMI is standard care in primary care settings, and changes in growth or weight may result in the detection of some eating disorders. Patients without observable physical symptoms may go unrecognized as having an eating disorder, or symptoms may be attributed to other conditions.<sup>1</sup> Various guidelines mention screening in the context of monitoring for potential signs and symptoms of eating disorders or to promote awareness of eating disorder symptoms in populations who may be at risk (eg, adolescents and young female athletes). No recent estimates of screening rates have been found in the literature.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Other Related USPSTF Recommendations</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF recommends screening for depression in adults, including pregnant and postpartum persons (B recommendation).<sup>22</sup> The USPSTF also recommends screening for depression in adolescents aged 12 to 18 years (B recommendation) and found insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening in children 11 years or younger (I statement).<sup>23</sup> The USPSTF recommends counseling interventions for pregnant and postpartum persons who are at increased risk of perinatal depression (B recommendation).<sup>24</sup></p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF recommends offering or referring adults with a BMI of 30 or greater (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) to intensive, multicomponent behavioral interventions to improve important health outcomes.<sup>25</sup> The USPSTF also recommends that clinicians screen children and adolescents 6 years or older for obesity and offer or refer them to comprehensive, intensive behavioral interventions to promote improvements in weight status.<sup>26</sup></p>","other":"<h2>Supporting Evidence</h2><h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF commissioned a systematic review<sup>1,27</sup> to evaluate the benefits and harms of screening for eating disorders in adolescents and adults with a normal or high BMI. Evidence limited to populations who are underweight or have other physical signs or symptoms of eating disorders was not considered. The USPSTF has not previously made a recommendation on this topic.</p>\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening Tests and Risk Assessment</h3>\r\n<p>Seventeen studies (10 of good quality) evaluated the accuracy of various screening questionnaires for detecting any eating disorder or specific eating disorders. Sample sizes ranged from 51 to 1541 participants (median, 341).<sup>1,27</sup> Most studies assessed the SCOFF (11 studies); 2 studies assessed the EDS-PC, and other questionnaires were assessed by 1 study each.<sup>1</sup> Accuracy was compared with either a diagnostic clinical interview or a range of longer self-reported diagnostic questionnaires. Only 2 studies evaluated adolescents, and there was limited reporting on other populations of interest (eg, populations of different races and ethnicities and sexual gender identities).<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<p>For detecting any eating disorder among adults, the SCOFF (cut point &ge;2) had a pooled sensitivity of 84% (95% CI, 74% to 90%) and a pooled specificity of 80% (95% CI, 65% to 89%) (10 trials; n = 3684). At a higher cut point (&ge;3), the pooled sensitivity was lower (69% [95% CI, 56% to 80%]) and specificity was higher (80% [95% CI, 65% to 89%]) (7 trials; n = 2749). Two studies assessed the EDS-PC among adults using a cut point of 2 or greater; sensitivity was similar (97% and 100%) and specificity varied (40% and 71%).<sup>1</sup> The Adolescent Binge Eating Questionnaire had a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 27% in a population of adolescents (aged 11 to 18 years) recruited from a pediatric obesity clinic. A single study evaluated the SCOFF in a sample of adolescent females and males and found a sensitivity of 73% and a specificity of 78%.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no studies that directly assessed the benefits of screening for eating disorders. Forty fair- to good-quality randomized clinical trials (n = 3969) assessed interventions for adult populations with recently detected or previously untreated eating disorders. No trials were found that enrolled participants who were screen-detected in primary care. Study participants were either referred or recruited to treatment. Many studies enrolled participants via advertisements for interventions for binge eating and obesity.<sup>1</sup> Trials evaluated heterogeneous interventions. The majority of the trials enrolled mostly female participants and populations with binge eating disorder or bulimia nervosa only. One trial was limited to adolescents; another trial enrolled adults and adolescents. Two trials (n = 116,954) enrolled a majority of males. No eligible trials focused on populations with anorexia nervosa.<sup>1</sup> One trial (n = 40) enrolled Latina individuals only; 2 trials (n = 156) enrolled a study population that was 54% to 55% racial and ethnic groups; all others enrolled a majority of White study participants. There was limited evidence on specific populations of interest (eg, by age, sex, race and ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, and mental health comorbidity).<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<p>Twenty-four trials (n = 1644) assessed psychological interventions. Among adults with binge eating disorder, guided self-help improved eating disorder symptom severity more than inactive control (pooled standardized mean difference [SMD], &minus;0.96 [95% CI, &minus;1.26 to &minus;0.67]) (5 trials; n = 391). Unguided self-help (6 trials; n = 368) also favored intervention; however, the difference between groups was not statistically significant (SMD, &minus;0.18 [95% CI, &minus;0.38 to 0.03]). Self-help interventions reduced depression symptoms more than inactive control, including guided self-help (pooled SMD, &minus;0.73 [95% CI, &minus;1.04 to &minus;0.43]) (4 trials; n = 324) and unguided self-help (pooled SMD, 0.37 [95% CI, &minus;0.68 to &minus;0.05]) (3 trials; n = 156). Few trials of self-help interventions assessed other outcomes. Group therapy for binge eating disorder (7 trials; n = 253) was associated with larger reductions in depression scores from baseline than inactive control (pooled SMD, &minus;0.48 [95% CI, &minus;0.69 to 0.27]).<sup>1,27</sup> Few trials of group therapy measured other outcomes of eating disorder symptoms, and results were inconsistent. Results were inconsistent in the 2 trials that assessed a combination of fluoxetine and self-help for bulimia nervosa or fluoxetine with individual cognitive behavioral therapy for binge eating disorder.<sup>1</sup> Four trials (n = 319) of various types of individual therapy were assessed; however, the trials measured heterogenous outcomes with inconsistent results.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<p>Eighteen trials (n = 2433) assessed the benefit of pharmacotherapy compared with placebo. Most trials evaluated outcomes over a duration of 6 to 12 weeks; 3 trials assessed outcomes over 16 weeks.<sup>1</sup> Four trials of lisdexamfetamine for the treatment of binge eating disorder (n = 900) measured change in eating disorder symptom severity using the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale modified for binge eating (YBOCS-BE) and found larger reductions in changes from baseline scores associated with lisdexamfetamine (50 to 60 mg/d) than placebo (pooled mean difference, &minus;5.75 [95% CI, &minus;8.32 to &minus;3.17]). Two trials (n = 465) compared topiramate with placebo for the treatment of binge eating disorder and found statistically significant larger reductions in YBOCS-BE scores from baseline among the topiramate group than the placebo group, from &minus;6.40 (<em>P</em> &lt; .001) to &minus;2.55 (<em>P</em> = .004). Five trials (n = 208) evaluated various SSRIs in study participants with binge eating disorder and reported inconsistent results on heterogeneous outcome measures specific to eating disorder symptoms. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were associated with a larger reduction in depression symptom scores than placebo (pooled SMD, &minus;0.6 [95% CI, &minus;0.90 to 0.33]) (5 studies; n = 208). Three trials (n = 528) assessed fluoxetine for populations with bulimia nervosa and found inconsistent results for improvement in eating disorder symptom severity and depression.<sup>1,27</sup> Two trials measured eating disorder symptom severity (the EDE-Q [Eating Disorder Examination&ndash;Questionnaire] and YBOCS-BE) and found a reduction in symptom scores favoring SSRIs.</p>\r\n<p>The body of evidence has several limitations. Most studies of screening test accuracy assessed the SCOFF in adult females, but few studies evaluated screening tools in males, adolescents, or other populations (eg, populations of different races and ethnicities and sexual gender identities).<sup>1</sup> Intervention trials did not identify study participants from primary care clinics. Trials mostly recruited participants using advertisements or referrals, and some advertised studies focused on binge eating and obesity. As a result, intervention studies have limited generalizability to populations who would be detected by routine screening in primary care settings. In addition, most treatment trials only included females with binge eating disorder or bulimia nervosa; none focused on populations with other eating disorders. Treatment trials assessed outcomes over a short duration (6 to 16 weeks), and there was limited evidence of effectiveness in specific populations of interest. Although treatment may improve some outcomes in symptomatic persons and those who are motivated to respond to trial advertisements, it is unclear whether screening and treatment of screen-detected persons can improve health outcomes in asymptomatic patients.</p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Screening and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no studies that directly evaluated the harms of screening. None of the trials of psychological interventions reported on harms. Nine trials of pharmacotherapy (n = 2006) reported on adverse events of 4 medications: lisdexamfetamine (4 trials), topiramate (2 trials), fluoxetine (2 trials), and escitalopram (1 trial). Trials were of short duration (6 to 16 weeks). Lisdexamfetamine was associated with higher rates of dry mouth, headache, and insomnia than placebo. Topiramate was associated with higher rates of paresthesia, taste perversion, and difficulty with concentration or confusion than placebo. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were associated with insomnia, nausea, and tremor.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from October 19, 2021, to November 15, 2021. Several comments asked for clarification of the patient population under consideration. In response, the USPSTF added language to the Practice Considerations section regarding the asymptomatic patient population. Comments asked for additional details on the benefits of treatment. As a result, the USPSTF added additional text to the Supporting Evidence section.</p><h2>Research Needs and Gaps</h2><p>There are several critical evidence gaps in understanding the potential net benefit of screening for eating disorders.

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that pediatricians include screening for eating disorders in their annual health supervision or sports examinations through longitudinal weight and height monitoring as well as looking for signs of disordered eating. All preteens and adolescents should be screened about eating patterns and body image issues.<sup>27</sup> The Academy for Eating Disorders recommends that all high-risk patients should be monitored for symptoms of eating disorders.<sup>28</sup> The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry recommends that mental health professionals screen all preteen and adolescent patients for eating disorders through height and weight assessments and screening questions about eating patterns and body image and refer for further evaluation, if needed.<sup>29</sup> The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that clinicians be able to identify signs of disordered eating and screen at-risk patients.<sup>30,31</sup></p>","topic":"Eating Disorders in Adolescents and Adults: Screening","keywords":"anorexia|bulemia|eating disorder|binge","pubDate":"2022-03-15","categories":["1","4","8"],"tool":["421","423","422"]},"614":{"topicType":"Screening","topicYear":2022,"uspstfAlias":"chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-screening","specific":[1973],"title":"Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: Screening","rationale":"<h2>Importance</h2><p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an irreversible reduction of airflow in the lungs.

It does not apply to persons who present to clinicians with symptoms such as chronic cough, sputum production, difficulty breathing, or wheezing. The evidence review did not include populations at very high risk for COPD such as persons with &alpha;-1 antitrypsin deficiency (an inherited disorder that increases risk for COPD) or workers with known occupational exposures.</p>\r\n<h3>Definitions</h3>\r\n<p>A postbronchodilator spirometry ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 second to forced vital capacity (FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC) of less than 0.70 confirms the presence of persistent airway obstruction and a diagnosis of COPD in persons with appropriate symptoms and significant exposures to noxious stimuli.<sup>12</sup> Severity of disease can be classified by the degree of obstruction, symptoms, or both. Airflow obstruction is classified by the postbronchodilator FEV1% predicted; 80% or more is mild, 50% to 79% is moderate, 30% to 49% is severe, and less than 30% is very severe. Symptoms are categorized using scoring from standardized tools assessing symptom burden (eg, shortness of breath, cough, and phlegm production) and history of exacerbations.<sup>12,13</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>\r\n<p>Although the USPSTF does not recommend screening for COPD in asymptomatic adults, certain factors may increase a person&rsquo;s risk for COPD. Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of COPD in the US.<sup>1,7</sup> About 15% of current smokers and 8% of former smokers report being diagnosed with COPD, compared with 3% of adults who have never smoked.<sup>7</sup> Exposure to other lung irritants such as secondhand smoke, traffic pollutants, and wood smoke also contribute to COPD. Toxic fumes, dust, and chemicals from workplace exposures are estimated to contribute to 15% of COPD cases. Nonmodifiable risk factors for COPD include history of asthma or childhood respiratory tract infections and &alpha;-1 antitrypsin deficiency.<sup>13</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>Although the USPSTF does not recommend routine screening for COPD in the general population using any method, screening questionnaires and spirometry without a bronchodilator have sometimes been used to identify persons at increased risk for COPD. If results are positive, such screening tests would require follow-up diagnostic testing.</p>\r\n<h3>Treatment or Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>Currently, there is no cure for COPD. Prevention of exposure to cigarette smoke and other toxic fumes is the best way to prevent COPD. Interventions to prevent the initiation of tobacco use are an effective way to prevent exposure to cigarette smoke. Current smokers (regardless of whether COPD is diagnosed) should receive smoking cessation counseling and be offered behavioral and pharmacologic therapies to stop smoking.<sup>12</sup></p>\r\n<p>Pharmacologic therapies (eg, bronchodilators and anti-inflammatory therapies) and nonpharmacologic therapies (eg, interventions addressing self-management of disease, diet, exercise, and immunizations) are available for disease management in persons with mild to moderate or minimally symptomatic COPD. Decisions to start or advance treatment are primarily based on symptoms and exacerbations, rather than measured obstruction.<sup>12</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Additional Tools and Resources</h3>\r\n<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, and other federal agencies provide a comprehensive systems-based COPD National Action Plan to reduce the burden of COPD (<a href=\"https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/all-publications-and-resources/copd-national-action-plan\">https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/all-publications-and-resources/copd-national-action-plan</a><u>)</u>.</p>\r\n<p>The National Institutes of Health &ldquo;Learn More Breathe Better&rdquo; program provides information about the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of COPD (<a href=\"https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/education-and-awareness/copd-learn-more-breathe-better\">https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/education-and-awareness/copd-learn-more-breathe-better</a><u>)</u>.</p>\r\n<p>The US Surgeon General provides tools to prevent tobacco use and promote smoking cessation (<a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/surgeongeneral/reports-and-publications/tobacco/index.html\">https://www.hhs.gov/surgeongeneral/reports-and-publications/tobacco/index.html</a><u>)</u>.</p>\r\n<h3>Other Related USPSTF Recommendations</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF recommends that clinicians ask all adults, including pregnant persons, about tobacco use, advise them to stop using tobacco, and provide interventions for cessation for those who use tobacco.<sup>14</sup> The USPSTF also recommends that clinicians provide interventions, including education or brief counseling, to prevent initiation of tobacco use among school-aged children and adolescents.<sup>15</sup></p><h2>Reaffirmation of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h2><p>This recommendation is a reaffirmation of the USPSTF 2016 recommendation statement. In 2016, the USPSTF reviewed the evidence for COPD and found that screening for COPD in asymptomatic adults has no net benefit.<sup>10</sup> The USPSTF found no new substantial evidence that could change its recommendation and, therefore, reaffirms its recommendation against screening for COPD in asymptomatic adults.</p><h2>Supporting Evidence</h2><h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n<p>To reaffirm its recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a reaffirmation evidence update.<sup>13,16</sup> The aim of evidence updates that support the reaffirmation process is to identify if there is new and substantial evidence since the previous review that is sufficient enough to change the prior recommendation.<sup>11</sup> The reaffirmation update focused on targeted key questions for benefits and harms of screening for COPD in asymptomatic adults and treatment in screen-detected or screen-relevant adults. A new treatment modality evaluated in this review was nonpharmacologic interventions.</p>\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening Tests and Risk Assessment</h3>\r\n<p>Based on foundational evidence from the 2016 review, externally validated questionnaires that assess risk factors, symptoms, or both and are applicable to US primary care settings had high sensitivity but poorer specificity for detecting COPD (sensitivity ranged from 67% to 90%; specificity ranged from 25% to 73%).<sup>17</sup> Evidence evaluating the accuracy of pulmonary function tests alone to detect COPD was limited.<sup>17</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no new studies that directly assess the effects of screening for COPD in asymptomatic adults on morbidity, mortality, or health-related quality of life.<sup>13,16</sup></p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed 3 trials with newly published analyses (n = 20,058) that evaluated pharmacologic treatment in persons with mild to moderate COPD (based on airway obstruction) and varying levels of symptoms.<sup>13,16</sup> No treatment trials were conducted in asymptomatic populations. Studies included treating persons with COPD with long-acting beta-agonists (LABAs), long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs), inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), or combination therapy. One large randomized clinical trial (SUMMIT; n = 16,590) in persons with or at risk for cardiovascular disease demonstrated in adults with fairly symptomatic moderate COPD (eg, mean FEV1 &asymp;60% predicted) that LABAs, ICS, or LABAs + ICS reduced the annual rate of exacerbations and hospitalizations for exacerbations compared with placebo at a median of 1.8 years of follow-up, although exacerbation rates were low at baseline (&lt;1 exacerbation/y). The percent reduction in the annual rate of moderate to severe exacerbations was higher for LABAs + ICS (29% [95% CI, 22%-35%]) than for LABAs (10% [95% CI, 2%-18%) or ICS (12% [95% CI, 4%-19%) alone.<sup>13,16</sup></p>\r\n<p>Post hoc subgroup analysis of minimally symptomatic patients with moderate COPD (n = 357) in the UPLIFT trial suggests that LAMAs were associated with a reduction in the proportion of persons with exacerbations compared with placebo at 48 months (48% vs 54%, respectively; rate ratio, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.47-0.89]). A post hoc subgroup analysis in the PINNACLE trial (n = 729) comparing LAMAs, LABAs, and LAMAs + LABAs vs placebo in minimally symptomatic adults was underpowered in sample size and follow-up time. No studies showed that treatment reduced cardiovascular morbidity or mortality or all-cause mortality.<sup>13,16</sup> Overall, consistent with the previous review,<sup>17</sup> the evidence showed that pharmacotherapy may reduce exacerbations in adults with fairly symptomatic moderate COPD, which may not be generalizable to an asymptomatic population. Also, the magnitude of these treatment benefits is limited by portions of the data coming from small post hoc subgroup analysis and persons having low rates of exacerbations at baseline.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed 13 new trials (n = 3658) evaluating nonpharmacologic interventions used in the management of mild to moderate COPD or COPD in persons who are minimally symptomatic: 7 trials of self-management interventions (eg, education on COPD, medications, healthy lifestyle, tobacco cessation, and an exacerbation management/action plan), 1 trial of exercise-only counseling, 3 trials of intensive supervised exercise or pulmonary rehabilitation, and 2 trials of clinician education/training on COPD care. Overall, there was no consistent benefit observed across a range of outcomes (eg, exacerbations, quality of life, difficulty breathing, exercise or physical performance measures, mental health, and smoking cessation) at 26 to 104 weeks.<sup>13,16</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Screening and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed new data from 6 of the included treatment trials and 2 observational studies (n = 243,517) that reported on pharmacologic or nonpharmacologic treatment harms in adults with mild to moderate or minimally symptomatic COPD.<sup>13,16</sup> None of the included treatment trials that reported adverse effects (n = 17,676) found significant harms; however, studies were limited by the small number of included participants and limited length of follow-up. In addition, 2 observational studies addressed the harms of medications. One study of cardiovascular risk associated with treatment with LABAs or LAMAs found an increased risk of a serious cardiovascular event following the initiation of LABAs or LAMAs (n = 183,858; adjusted odds ratio, 1.50 [95% CI, 1.35-1.67] and 1.52 [95% CI, 1.28-1.80], respectively); cardiovascular risk association with LABAs or LAMAs was absent, or even reduced, with prevalent use of inhaled therapy. A second study found that ICS may increase the risk of developing diabetes (n = 9923 for diabetes onset in a subset of persons classified in GOLD [Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease] category A/B; hazard ratio, 1.32 [95% CI, 1.06-1.64]).<sup>13</sup> These 2 observational studies represent a subset of a much larger body of evidence on serious harms of bronchodilators and ICS in the treatment of COPD, such as heart failure and pneumonia, as described in meta-analyses not included in this review. In addition to potential treatment harms, there are opportunity costs to screening that may include time spent on counseling and providing services and patient referrals for diagnostic testing.</p>\r\n<p>Overall, generally consistent with the previous review,<sup>17</sup> serious harms from treatment trials were not consistently reported. However, large observational studies in screen-relevant populations suggest possible harms for LAMA or LABA initiation or use of ICS.<sup>13,16</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from November 2 to December 6, 2021. The USPSTF updated background information with the most current COPD-related mortality data and disease diagnostic criteria in the Importance and Practice Consideration sections. The USPSTF clarified in the Practice Considerations section that the recommendation does not apply to workers with known occupational exposures. Comments inquired whether smoking history should be a consideration for screening. Although smoking is the primary risk factor for COPD, the evidence reviewed, which included current and former smokers, did not show an overall benefit for screening for COPD in asymptomatic adults. Comments also questioned whether screening for COPD could increase smoking cessation. Studies have not consistently shown that receipt of spirometry results or information about &ldquo;lung age&rdquo; increases smoking cessation. Comments asked for clarification on the benefits and harms of COPD treatment. The USPSTF describes the benefits and harms of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic COPD treatments in the Supporting Evidence section. The USPSTF acknowledges that there is a larger body of evidence not included in this targeted review that discusses harms of medications used to treat COPD and cites a meta-analysis for further reference.</p><h2>Research Needs and Gaps</h2><p>Studies are needed that provide more information on the following.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The effectiveness of screening asymptomatic adults for COPD to reduce morbidity or mortality or improve health-related quality of life, with long-term follow-up.</li>\r\n<li>The effectiveness of early treatment for asymptomatic, minimally symptomatic, or screen-detected populations to slow disease progression and improve health outcomes, with long-term follow-up.</li>\r\n<li>The harms of screening in and treatment of persons with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic COPD.</li>\r\n<li>The drivers of health disparities in COPD among different racial and ethnic groups and effective prevention strategies that may improve health inequities.</li>\r\n</ul>","other":"<h2>Recommendations of Others</h2><p>In 2011, the American College of Physicians, American College of Chest Physicians, American Thoracic Society, and European Respiratory Society issued joint guidelines recommending that spirometry be used to diagnose airflow obstruction in patients with respiratory symptoms.

These recommendations do not apply to adults with a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level greater than 190 mg/dL (4.92 mmol/L) or known familial hypercholesterolemia. These populations are at very high risk for CVD, and considerations on the use of statins in these populations can be found in other organizations&rsquo; guidelines.</p>\r\n<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>\r\n<p>The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) Pooled Cohort Equations may be used to estimate 10-year risk of CVD. The ACC/AHA risk estimator is, to date, the only US-based CVD risk prediction tool that has published external validation studies in other US-based populations.<sup>6</sup> The estimator has separate equations based on sex and for Black persons and non-Black persons, which include the risk factors of age, cholesterol levels, systolic blood pressure level, antihypertension treatment, presence of diabetes, and smoking status, and focuses on hard clinical outcomes (myocardial infarction and death from coronary heart disease; ischemic stroke and stroke-related death) as the outcomes of interest. Age is one of the strongest risk factors for CVD, and the 10-year CVD event risk estimated by the ACC/AHA risk estimator is heavily influenced by increasing age. The risk prediction equations generally show higher risk for Black persons than White persons.<sup>6</sup> The USPSTF recognizes that race is a social construct, and it is an imperfect proxy for social determinants of health and the effects of structural racism. Concerns about calibration of the Pooled Cohort Equations exist, with many external validation studies showing overprediction in broad populations (men and women across racial and ethnic groups).<sup>7-9</sup> Limited evidence also suggests underprediction in disadvantaged communities<sup>10,11</sup> that could lead to underutilization of preventive therapies. Clinicians should recognize that predictions of 10-year CVD events using the Pooled Cohort Equations are estimates.</p>\r\n<p>The likelihood that a patient will benefit from statin use depends on their absolute risk of having a future CVD event, a risk estimation that, as noted above, is imprecise based on the currently available risk estimation tools. The higher a person&rsquo;s 10-year risk of a CVD event, the greater the chance of benefit from statin use. Thus, the expected benefit of statin therapy for persons with a 10-year CVD risk of 10% or greater exceeds the expected benefit for persons with a 10-year CVD risk of 7.5% to less than 10%. Clinicians should discuss with patients the potential risk of having a CVD event and the expected benefits and harms of statin use. For patients with an estimated 10-year CVD risk of 10% or greater and who smoke or have dyslipidemia, diabetes, or hypertension, the USPSTF recommends that clinicians prescribe a statin once the rationale has been explained and the patient agrees to take a statin.<sup>12</sup> For patients with an estimated 10-year CVD risk of 7.5% to less than 10% (and who have &ge;1 of the risk factors noted above), clinicians may selectively offer a statin, taking patient values and preferences into account. Patients in this estimated risk range who place a higher value on the potential benefits than on the potential harms and inconvenience of taking a daily medication may choose to initiate a statin.</p>\r\n<p>Given that participants in clinical trials of statin therapy were enrolled based on the presence of 1 or more CVD risk factors, and that the magnitude of benefit of statin use is proportional to a person&rsquo;s estimated 10-year CVD risk, the USPSTF recommends that clinicians evaluate both the presence of CVD risk factors (ie, dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, or smoking) as well as estimated 10-year risk of CVD in determining which persons should initiate use of statins.</p>\r\n<h3>Treatment and Statin Intensity</h3>\r\n<p>There are limited data directly comparing the effects of different statin intensities on health outcomes. A majority of the trials reviewed by the USPSTF used moderate-intensity statin therapy.<sup>13</sup> Based on available evidence, use of moderate-intensity statin therapy seems reasonable for the primary prevention of CVD in most persons.</p>\r\n<h3>Implementation</h3>\r\n<p>Several studies have reported inequities in statin use based on demographic and socioeconomic factors such as race and ethnicity, sex, area poverty level, and income level. Some studies found that Black adults have a decreased likelihood of being prescribed a statin<sup>14</sup> and statin use<sup>15</sup> compared with White adults. Having no health insurance was also associated with decreased likelihood of statin use, as was having multiple vulnerabilities (defined as age 65 years or older, being a woman, being Black, area poverty level of 10% or greater, or no health insurance).<sup>15</sup> Older age, having health insurance, and higher income were associated with an increased likelihood of statin use.<sup>16,17</sup> Data from the 2013-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey found that among persons eligible for statin use, statin use was higher among non-Hispanic White (58.3%) persons compared with non-Hispanic Asian (49.2%), non-Hispanic Black (44.3%), or Hispanic (33.7%) persons.<sup>18</sup> It is essential to equitably improve statin use in both women and men of all races and ethnicities, regardless of socioeconomic level or health insurance status, to achieve the full benefits of statin use, and especially among Black adults and Hispanic adults, who have the highest prevalence of CVD<sup>4</sup> and the lowest use of statins, respectively.</p>\r\n<h3>Additional Tools and Resources</h3>\r\n<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides information about cholesterol-lowering medications, including statins (<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/cholesterol/treating_cholesterol.htm\">https://www.cdc.gov/cholesterol/treating_cholesterol.htm</a><u>),</u> and resources for clinicians (<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/cholesterol/educational_materials.htm\">https://www.cdc.gov/cholesterol/educational_materials.htm</a><u>)</u>.</p>\r\n<p>Million Hearts, a national initiative from the US Department of Health and Human Services to prevent myocardial infarctions and strokes, provides information on statins (<a href=\"https://millionhearts.hhs.gov/learn-prevent/scoop-on-statins.html\">https://millionhearts.hhs.gov/learn-prevent/scoop-on-statins.html</a><u>)</u>.</p>\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement<em>&nbsp;</em></h3>\r\n<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>\r\n<p>According to the National Center for Health Statistics, heart disease and cerebrovascular disease were respectively the first and fourth leading causes of death in adults 65 years or older in 2018, although data were not reported separately for adults older than 75 years.<sup>19</sup> However, trial data on the benefits of statin use in persons older than 75 years are limited,<sup>13</sup> and the available evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against initiating statin use for the primary prevention of CVD in this age group.</p>\r\n<h4>Potential Harms</h4>\r\n<p>Evidence on the potential harms of statin use for the primary prevention of CVD events specifically in adults 76 years or older is limited. Evidence from trials in the general adult population shows that statins are not associated with an increased risk of myalgia, elevated alanine aminotransferase level, or cognitive harms compared with placebo.<sup>13</sup> Almost all trials did not find an association between statin use and incidence of diabetes; 1 trial, JUPITER (Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin), found that high-intensity statin therapy was associated with increased risk of diabetes,<sup>20</sup> although a subsequent analysis found that this increased risk was limited to participants with diabetes risk factors at baseline (metabolic syndrome, impaired fasting glucose, body mass index &ge;30 [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by square of height in meters], or hemoglobin A1c level &gt;6%).<sup>21</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Current Practice</h4>\r\n<p>Data on statin use for the primary prevention of CVD in persons 76 years or older are limited. One study estimated that 10.7 million adults 75 years or older were taking a statin in 2013 to 2014, although it did not distinguish between statin use for primary vs secondary prevention.<sup>18</sup> A second study reported that among adults 75 years or older without a history of CVD, those with diabetes had rates of statin use more than 2 times higher than among those without diabetes (76.1 and 34.5 initiators per 1000 person-years, respectively). This study did not report the prevalence of statin use.<sup>22</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Other Related USPSTF Recommendations</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF has made several recommendations related to the prevention of CVD in adults, including aspirin use to prevent CVD,<sup>23</sup> screening for high blood pressure,<sup>24</sup> screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes,<sup>25</sup> interventions for tobacco smoking cessation,<sup>26</sup> behavioral counseling to promote a healthy diet and physical activity for CVD prevention in adults (with and without cardiovascular risk factors),<sup>27,28</sup> and behavioral interventions to prevent obesity-related morbidity and mortality in adults.<sup>29</sup></p><h2>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h2><p>This recommendation replaces the 2016 USPSTF recommendation on statin use for the primary prevention of CVD and is generally consistent with that recommendation.<sup>30</sup> In 2016, the USPSTF recommended that adults without a history of CVD (ie, symptomatic coronary artery disease or ischemic stroke) use a low- to moderate-dose statin for the prevention of CVD events and mortality when all of the following criteria are met: (1) they are aged 40 to 75 years; (2) they have 1 or more CVD risk factors (ie, dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, or smoking); and (3) they have a calculated 10-year risk of a cardiovascular event of 10% or greater. The USPSTF also recommended that clinicians may choose to offer a low- to moderate-dose statin to adults without a history of CVD who meet criteria 1 and 2 above and have a calculated 10-year risk of a cardiovascular event of 7.5% to less than 10%. The USPSTF concluded that the evidence was insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of initiating statin use for the primary prevention of CVD events and mortality in adults 76 years or older.<sup>30</sup></p>","other":"<h2>Supporting Evidence</h2><h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n<p>To update its 2016 recommendation statement, the USPSTF commissioned a systematic review<sup>13,31</sup> of the evidence on the benefits and harms of statins in reducing CVD-related morbidity or mortality or all-cause mortality. The evidence review also investigated whether the benefits or harms of statin treatment vary in populations of interest defined by demographic, clinical, or socioeconomic characteristics, by statin intensity, or by titration of statin therapy to a target LDL-C level vs use of a fixed statin dose.</p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Preventive Medication</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed 22 trials that reported on the benefits of statin use for primary prevention. Mean duration of follow-up was 3.3 years. Mean age of study participants ranged from 52 to 66 years in all trials except for 1, PROSPER (Prospective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk), which enrolled persons aged 70 to 82 years (mean age, 75 years).<sup>32</sup> Among the trials that used a fixed statin dose, most (12/16) used a moderate-intensity statin, as defined by ACC/AHA criteria. Fifteen trials reported race and ethnicity; White persons were the most common group in 14 of those trials, representing 41% to 99% of the study population. The proportion of Black participants, reported in 5 trials, ranged from less than 1% to 37%. Data for other races and ethnicities were limited. All trials enrolled persons with at least 1 cardiovascular risk factor, and a few required the presence of multiple cardiovascular risk factors at baseline. The most common risk factors were dyslipidemia (which was variably defined), diabetes, and hypertension.<sup>13,31</sup></p>\r\n<p>In pooled analyses, statin therapy was associated with decreased risk of all-cause mortality (18 trials; n = 85,816; relative risk [RR], 0.92 [95% CI, 0.87 to 0.98]; absolute risk difference [ARD], &minus;0.35%), fatal or nonfatal stroke (15 trials; n = 76,610; RR, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.68 to 0.90]; ARD, &minus;0.39%), and fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction (12 trials; n = 76,498; RR, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.60 to 0.75]; ARD, &minus;0.89%). In several trials, primary outcome was reported as a composite of CVD events, with the exact components of this end point varying across trials. In a pooled analysis of 15 trials, statin therapy was also associated with a decreased risk of composite cardiovascular outcomes (n = 74,390; RR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.64 to 0.81]; ARD, &minus;1.28%).<sup>13,31</sup></p>\r\n<p>Twelve trials (n = 75,138) reported on cardiovascular mortality. Only 1 trial, WOSCOPS (West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study; n = 6595), reported a statistically significant difference between statin and placebo in risk of cardiovascular mortality (RR, 0.68 at 6 years [95% CI, 0.48 to 0.98]; ARD, &minus;0.70% [95% CI, &minus;1.36% to &minus;0.05%]).<sup>33</sup> In pooled analyses of all 12 trials, statin therapy was associated with a slight reduction in cardiovascular mortality risk at 2 to 6 years that was not statistically significant (RR, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.81 to 1.02]; ARD, &minus;0.13%; [95% CI, &minus;0.25% to &minus;0.02%]).<sup>13,31</sup></p>\r\n<p>Evidence on the benefits of statins in persons 75 years or older is limited. As noted, most trials had a mean participant age in the 50s and 60s; only 1 trial, PROSPER (n = 3239 for primary prevention), had a study population with a mean age of 75 years.<sup>32</sup> One additional trial, ALLHAT-LLT (Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial&ndash;Lipid Lowering Trial), reported stratified results for the age group 75 years or older (in addition to other age groups).<sup>34,35</sup> The primary prevention data from PROSPER found no decrease in all-cause mortality (RR, 1.07 [95% CI, 0.86 to 1.35]), risk of stroke (RR, 1.03 [95% CI, 0.73 to 1.45]), or in a composite cardiovascular outcome (RR, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.78 to 1.14]) among persons taking a statin compared with placebo.<sup>32</sup> In the ALLHAT-LLT primary prevention population, statin therapy was associated with higher risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in persons 75 years or older than in those aged 65 to 74 years (hazard ratio, 1.36 [95% CI, 0.98 to 1.89] vs 1.05 [95% CI, 0.82 to 1.33], respectively, for all-cause mortality; RR, 1.39 [95% CI, 0.85 to 2.25] vs 0.99 [95% CI, 0.71 to 1.39], respectively, for cardiovascular mortality), but estimates for the age group 75 years or older were imprecise and the difference was not statistically significant.<sup>34,35</sup> However, ALLHAT-LLT had several limitations, including its open-label design, high loss to follow-up, and high crossover from the usual care treatment group. This trial reported a small differential in LDL-C&ndash;lowering effect between the statin therapy group and usual care group and showed no benefit of statin use overall.</p>\r\n<p>In stratified analyses, the relative benefits of statin therapy did not appear to differ across a variety of demographic and clinical variables, including age (with the caveat that data are limited for persons older than 75 years), sex, and race and ethnicity, or the presence or absence of specific risk factors such as hypertension or diabetes. No trials reported how benefits of statin therapy vary according to socioeconomic characteristics.<sup>13,31</sup></p>\r\n<p>No study directly compared treatment with statins titrated to attain a target cholesterol level vs fixed-dose treatment strategies. There were also limited data directly comparing the effects of different statin intensities on health outcomes. Across-study comparisons did not indicate differences in outcomes based on dose titration vs fixed-dose statin therapy or based on statin intensity. As noted, most trials used a moderate-intensity statin.<sup>13,31</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Preventive Medication</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed 19 trials (n = 75,005) and 3 observational studies (n = 417,523) that reported on the harms of statin therapy in adults without a history of a CVD event. In pooled analyses of trial data, statin therapy was not associated with increased risk of study withdrawal due to adverse events or serious adverse events.<sup>13,31</sup> Although observational studies have reported an association between statin use and muscle pain,<sup>36</sup> a pooled analysis of 9 trials (n = 46,388) found no increased risk of myalgia with statin therapy compared with placebo.<sup>13,31</sup> Trials also did not find an association between statin therapy and myopathy or rhabdomyolysis, although these events were uncommon, so the estimates of relative risk are imprecise.<sup>13,31</sup></p>\r\n<p>Twelve trials (n = 55,358) reported no difference between statin therapy and placebo in risk of elevation in aminotransferase levels, and pooled analyses of 13 trials (n = 71,733) found no difference between statin therapy and placebo or no statin in risk of any cancer.<sup>13,31</sup></p>\r\n<p>Six trials (n = 59,083) and 3 observational studies (n = 417,523) reported on risk of new-onset diabetes with statin therapy. Based on a pooled analysis of 6 trials, there was no difference between statins and placebo or no statin in risk of diabetes (RR, 1.04 [95% CI, 0.92 to 1.19]; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 52%; ARD, 0.00% [95% CI, &minus;0.00% to 0.01%]).<sup>12</sup> One trial of high-intensity statin therapy (JUPITER) reported an increased risk of diabetes with statin use (3.0% vs 2.4%; RR, 1.25 [95% CI, 1.05 to 1.49])<sup>20</sup> that was subsequently found to be limited to study participants with 1 or more diabetes risk factors (metabolic syndrome, impaired fasting glucose, body mass index &ge;30, or hemoglobin A1c level &gt;6%) at baseline.<sup>21</sup> Cohort studies reported mixed findings. One case-control study found no association between statin use and risk of diabetes,<sup>37</sup> an analysis from the Women&rsquo;s Health Initiative found an increased risk (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.48 [95% CI, 1.38 to 1.59]),<sup>38</sup> and a third cohort reported mixed findings that varied by 10-year cardiovascular mortality risk (based on the SCORE instrument) and adherence to statin therapy.<sup>39</sup></p>\r\n<p>Evidence on the association between statins and renal or cognitive harms is very limited but does not indicate increased risk.<sup>13,31</sup> In 1 trial, statin therapy was associated with increased risk of cataract surgery, which was unanticipated and not a predetermined outcome of the trial (3.8% vs 3.1%; RR, 1.24 [95% CI, 1.03 to 1.49]; ARD, 0.73%).<sup>40</sup> Other trials did not note or report on this outcome.</p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from February 22 to March 21, 2022. Some comments sought clarification on why the USPSTF is recommending that both presence of a CVD risk factor and estimated 10-year CVD risk be used when considering initiation of a statin. As noted in the Practice Considerations section, statin trial inclusion criteria required the presence of 1 or more CVD risk factors. Additionally, the magnitude of the benefits of statin use is proportional to a person&rsquo;s CVD risk level; thus, the USPSTF concluded that a 10-year CVD risk of 7.5% to less than 10% provides at least a small net benefit and a 10-year CVD risk of 10% or greater provides at least a moderate net benefit. Some comments sought clarification on whether coronary artery calcium score could be used as a criterion for statin use. The USPSTF addressed the use of coronary artery calcium score for CVD risk assessment in a separate recommendation.<sup>41</sup> Some comments sought clarification on whether persons 76 years or older who are already taking a statin should continue its use. The USPSTF reiterates that this recommendation is about initiating a statin for the primary prevention of CVD events and mortality; in adults 76 years or older, the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of initiating statins. Some comments expressed concerns about the accuracy of the Pooled Cohort Equations across populations. The USPSTF understands these concerns and calls for more research on improving the accuracy of CVD risk prediction in all racial and ethnic and socioeconomic groups in the Research Needs and Gaps section. In addition, the USPSTF wants to clarify that these recommendations do not pertain to adults with familial hypercholesterolemia or an LDL-C level greater than 190 mg/dL (4.92 mmol/L). Considerations for statin use in these populations can be found in other organizations&rsquo; guidelines and resources on management of these conditions.</p><h2>Research Needs and Gaps</h2><p>More studies are needed that address the following.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Improving the accuracy of CVD risk prediction in all racial and ethnic and socioeconomic groups.</li>\r\n<li>The balance of benefits and harms of initiating statin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events in adults 76 years or older.</li>\r\n<li>The efficacy and safety of long-term statin use in adults younger than 40 years, and to determine the effects of earlier vs delayed initiation of statin use, particularly in persons with an estimated high long-term (longer than 10 years [eg, lifetime]) risk of CVD.</li>\r\n<li>The causes of disparities in statin use and effective methods to reduce disparities.</li>\r\n<li>Trials that directly compare statin therapy titrated to target lipid levels vs fixed-dose therapy to inform optimal dosing strategies.

Screening in adolescents who are pregnant is outside the scope of this recommendation. The USPSTF has a separate recommendation on screening for gestational diabetes.</p>\r\n<h3>Definitions of Prediabetes and Type 2 Diabetes</h3>\r\n<p><em>Diabetes</em> refers to a range of metabolic disorders characterized by hyperglycemia. Type 2 diabetes is characterized by insulin resistance and progressive loss of &beta;-cell insulin secretion.<sup>6</sup> In contrast, type 1 diabetes is the result of autoimmune &beta;-cell destruction, usually leading to absolute insulin deficiency. Prediabetes is the term used for individuals whose blood glucose levels (measured by plasma glucose level or hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub> [HbA<sub>1c</sub>] level) are considered higher than normal but do not meet criteria for diabetes.<sup>6</sup></p>\r\n<p>The definitions of prediabetes and diabetes in children and adolescents are the same as in adults.<sup>2,7</sup> A fasting plasma glucose level of 100 to 125 mg/dL (5.6-6.9 mmol/L), an HbA<sub>1c</sub> level of 5.7% to 6.4%, or a 2-hour postload glucose level of 140 to 199 mg/dL (7.8-11.0 mmol/L) are consistent with prediabetes.<sup>6</sup> A fasting plasma glucose level of 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L) or greater, an HbA<sub>1c</sub> level of 6.5% or greater, or a 2-hour postload glucose level of 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) or greater are consistent with the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes.<sup>6</sup> The diagnosis of prediabetes or type 2 diabetes should be confirmed with repeat testing before starting interventions.<sup>6</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>Although there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening in patients without signs or symptoms, prediabetes and type 2 diabetes can be detected by measuring fasting plasma glucose or HbA1c level, or with an oral glucose tolerance test.<sup>2,7</sup> HbA<sub>1c</sub> level is a measure of long-term blood glucose concentration and is not affected by acute changes in glucose levels. The oral glucose tolerance test is performed in the morning in a fasting state, with blood glucose concentration measured 2 hours after ingestion of a 75-g oral glucose load.</p>\r\n<h3>Treatment and Preventive Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>Lifestyle interventions to achieve weight loss, improve diet, and increase physical activity are often recommended for youth diagnosed with prediabetes and diabetes. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends programs that increase exercise and improve nutrition; these programs include extensive education on promoting self-management skills and establishing individualized plans for self-monitoring of glycemic targets.<sup>8</sup> Formal programs to improve diet and increase exercise are often paired with pharmacotherapy.<sup>9,10</sup> The US Food and Drug Administration has approved 3 drugs for treatment of type 2 diabetes in children: metformin, insulin, and liraglutide.<sup>2,7</sup> While metformin has demonstrated improvements in body mass index (BMI), fasting glucose level, and insulin resistance, it is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to prevent the progression of prediabetes to diabetes.<sup>11</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>\r\n<h4><em>Potential Preventable Burden</em></h4>\r\n<p>Diabetes (both type 1 and type 2) is the third most common chronic disease in childhood.<sup>2,7</sup> Many of the diabetes complications experienced by adults (such as kidney failure, non-injury&ndash;related lower-limb amputations, and blindness) can begin in childhood.</p>\r\n<p>Compared with non-Hispanic White youth, the type 2 diabetes rate in American Indian/Alaska Native, Black, and Hispanic/Latino youth has been shown to be 5, 4, and 8 times higher, respectively.<sup>12</sup> Causes of these differences are not well understood, but structural factors that disproportionately affect non-White populations, as well as cultural and environmental influences and quality of and access to health care, may contribute significantly to differences by race and ethnicity.<sup>13</sup></p>\r\n<p>Obesity and excess adipose tissue, especially when centrally distributed, are the most important risk factors for type 2 diabetes in younger persons.<sup>2,7,13</sup> Family history of diabetes (including gestational diabetes) is also a strong risk factor.<sup>2,7,13</sup> Risk assessment tools are also available to help identify children and adolescents at increased risk for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes; however, there is limited evidence on their accuracy.<sup>14,15</sup></p>\r\n<p>Type 2 diabetes is much more common in older than in younger children, often presenting at the onset of puberty.<sup>16</sup> This timing is likely related to physiologic, but transient, pubertal insulin resistance that can be exacerbated by metabolic challenges related to obesity.<sup>17,18</sup> Twenty-two percent to 52% of children and adolescents with prediabetes return to normal glycemia or normal glucose tolerance without intervention over 6 months to 2 years.<sup>2,7</sup></p>\r\n<h4><em>Potential Harms</em></h4>\r\n<p>Because some youth with prediabetes may revert to normal glycemia without intervention, potential harms of screening include labeling, overdiagnosis, and overtreatment. Potential harms caused by treatment of type 2 diabetes include hypoglycemia and gastrointestinal issues (eg, nausea or vomiting) related to medication use.<sup>2,7</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Other Related USPSTF Recommendations</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF has other recommendations on screening for obesity in children and adolescents (B recommendation) and screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes in adults (B recommendation).<sup>19,20</sup> The USPSTF also has a recommendation on screening for gestational diabetes in pregnant persons (B recommendation).<sup>21</sup></p>","discussion":"<h2>Supporting Evidence</h2><h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF commissioned a systematic review of the evidence on screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes in asymptomatic, nonpregnant persons younger than 18 years.<sup>3</sup> This review focused on evidence of the benefits and harms of screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes and the benefits and harms of interventions for screen-detected prediabetes and type 2 diabetes or recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes. The USPSTF focused on effects of screening and interventions on health outcomes, including mortality, cardiovascular morbidity, chronic kidney disease, amputation, skin ulcers, visual impairment, neuropathy, and quality of life. The review also looked at the evidence on the effectiveness of interventions for prediabetes to delay or prevent progression to type 2 diabetes.</p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no studies addressing the direct benefits of screening for type 2 diabetes and prediabetes on health outcomes in asymptomatic children and adolescents.</p>\r\n<p>Two randomized clinical trials examined the benefits of interventions for screen-detected or recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes and prediabetes on health outcomes. The first and larger study was the Treatment Options for Type 2 Diabetes in Adolescents and Youth (TODAY) study (n = 699), which randomly assigned adolescents with obesity (defined as a BMI &ge;85th percentile for age and sex) and recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes to metformin monotherapy, metformin plus rosiglitazone, or metformin plus a lifestyle intervention.<sup>3,10</sup> No statistically significant differences were found in rates of diabetic ketoacidosis or renal impairment. However, studies were underpowered to detect differences in these health outcomes.<sup>3</sup> The second study was a 16-week trial that compared metformin and placebo in 82 treatment-na&iuml;ve adolescents aged 10 to 16 years with previous or newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes.<sup>22</sup> It reported that zero participants in the metformin group developed diabetic ketoacidosis and 1 person in the control group developed diabetic ketoacidosis; however, this study was underpowered for this outcome, and this also was not the primary outcome for the study. Neither trial reported on other health outcomes.<sup>3</sup></p>\r\n<p>One fair-quality randomized clinical trial examined the benefits of interventions to prevent progression to type 2 diabetes. The study (n = 75) compared a lifestyle modification program focused on both diet or nutrition and physical activity with standard care for adolescents aged 10 to 16 years with obesity (defined as a BMI &gt;95th percentile) and prediabetes.<sup>23</sup> The trial reported that no participants developed diabetes during the 6-month trial; however, the overall attrition rate was high (23%), and some participants were withdrawn from the study because they started taking metformin.<sup>23</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Screening and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no studies addressing the harms of screening for type 2 diabetes and prediabetes in asymptomatic children and adolescents.</p>\r\n<p>Two previously mentioned intervention trials (n = 781)<sup>10,22</sup> reported on harms associated with treatment of youth recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. The TODAY study reported that 4 youths had severe hypoglycemia. It also reported that more youths had repeated mild hypoglycemia in the group that received metformin plus rosiglitazone than in the metformin monotherapy or metformin plus lifestyle intervention groups (n = 19 [8.2%] for metformin plus rosiglitazone vs n = 10 [4.3%] for metformin monotherapy vs n = 8 [3.4%] for metformin plus lifestyle intervention; <em>P</em> = .05 across the 3 groups).<sup>10</sup> The 16-week trial comparing metformin monotherapy with placebo reported zero hypoglycemic events requiring medical attention in either study group.<sup>22</sup></p>\r\n<p>Gastrointestinal events were common in both studies. In the TODAY study, lower rates of gastrointestinal symptoms were reported in the metformin plus rosiglitazone group than in the metformin monotherapy or metformin plus lifestyle intervention groups.<sup>10</sup> The 16-week trial reported that more youths treated with metformin than with placebo had abdominal pain (25% vs 12%) and nausea or vomiting (17% vs 10%).<sup>22</sup> Other adverse events were reported in both studies; however, events were varied, and most found no difference between groups or reported that events were not attributed to study interventions.<sup>3</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from December 14, 2021, to January 18, 2022. Several comments noted the connection between excess body weight and impaired glucose tolerance as well as the recent rise in childhood obesity. These comments suggested that a risk-based approach (ie, screening youth with overweight and obesity) may better identify children and adolescents with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. The USPSTF found no evidence on screening for type 2 diabetes or prediabetes in children and adolescents, including in those with risk factors. The USPSTF is calling for more studies on the benefits and harms of screening in children and adolescents, including those that may be at higher risk. Comments also proposed that the scope of the recommendation should include screening for type 1 diabetes. Given the distinct clinical course of type 1 diabetes, the USPSTF chose to focus on type 2 diabetes and prediabetes.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, the USPSTF wishes to clarify that the I statement is neither a recommendation for nor against screening. Clinicians should continue to use their clinical judgment to determine if screening is appropriate for individual patients.</p><h2>Research Needs and Gaps</h2><p>More studies are needed that address the following areas.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The effects of screening on health outcomes in child and adolescent populations reflective of the prevalence of diabetes in the US, particularly American Indian/Alaska Native, Black, Hispanic/Latino, and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander youth, who have a higher prevalence of diabetes than White youth.</li>\r\n<li>The effects of screening on health outcomes in children and adolescents considered to be at higher risk such as those who are overweight, have obesity, or have a family history of diabetes.</li>\r\n<li>The effects of lifestyle interventions, pharmacotherapy, or both for treatment of screen-detected prediabetes and diabetes on health outcomes in children and adolescents, particularly in racial and ethnic groups who have a higher prevalence of diabetes than White youth.</li>\r\n<li>Trials (both screening and intervention) focusing on health outcomes such as mortality, cardiovascular morbidity, chronic kidney disease, amputation, visual impairment, neuropathy, and quality of life that are of sufficient duration and sample size.</li>\r\n<li>The natural history of prediabetes in children and adolescents, including the identification of factors associated with risk of progression to diabetes or reversion to normoglycemia.</li>\r\n</ul><h2>Recommendations of Others</h2><p>The American Diabetes Association recommends risk-based screening for type 2 diabetes after onset of puberty or age 10 years in children who have overweight (defined as a BMI &ge;85th percentile) or obesity (defined as a BMI &ge;95th percentile) and 1 or more additional risk factors for diabetes.<sup>9</sup> In children who are deemed at high risk, it recommends screening every 3 years if tests are normal or more frequently if BMI increases.</p>","topic":"Prediabetes and Type 2 Diabetes in Children and Adolescents: Screening","keywords":"Diabetes mellitus|Type 2|prediabetes|insulin","pubDate":"2022-09-13","categories":["4"],"tool":["437","439","438"]},"674":{"topicType":"Screening","topicYear":2022,"uspstfAlias":"syphilis-infection-nonpregnant-adults-adolescents-screening","specific":[1989],"title":"Syphilis Infection in Nonpregnant Adolescents and Adults: Screening","rationale":"<h2>Importance</h2><p>Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) that can progress through different stages (primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary) and cause serious health problems if left untreated.<sup>1</sup> Tertiary syphilis, which occurs in approximately one-third of latent syphilis cases, can affect multiple organ systems.<sup>2</sup> Syphilis can attack the nervous system (neurosyphilis) and visual system (ocular syphilis) at any stage of disease, resulting in movement disorders, sensory deficits, dementia, paralysis, visual changes, or blindness.<sup>1</sup> Syphilis infection also increases the risk for acquiring or transmitting HIV infection.<sup>1,3</sup></p>\r\n<p>Primary and secondary syphilis are the most infectious stages of the disease. Reported cases of primary and secondary syphilis in the US increased from a record low of 2.1 cases per 100,000 population in 2000 and 2001 to 11.9 cases per 100,000 population in 2019. Men account for the majority of cases (83% of primary and secondary syphilis cases in 2019), and rates among women nearly tripled from 2015 to 2019. Men who have sex with men are disproportionately affected, accounting for a majority (57%) of all primary and secondary syphilis cases among men in 2019.<sup>4</sup> The overall rate of primary and secondary syphilis among men who have sex with men was 106 times the rate among men who only have sex with women and 168 times the rate among women.<sup>5</sup> Primary and secondary syphilis rates are highest among Black adolescents and adults, nearly 5 times the rate among White adolescents and adults. Elevated rates have also been reported in Hispanic adolescents and adults, Native American/Alaska Native adolescents and adults, and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander adolescents and adults.<sup>4</sup> These disparities are primarily driven by social conditions such as poverty, low education levels, and poor access to quality health care, which disproportionately affect communities of color and make it harder to maintain sexual health. Differences in sexual network characteristics also play a role in disparities.

This recommendation is inclusive of all persons at increased risk for syphilis.</p>\r\n<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF recommends screening for syphilis in persons who are at increased risk for infection. When deciding which persons to screen for syphilis, clinicians should consider the prevalence of infection in the communities they serve, as well as other sociodemographic and behavioral factors that may be associated with increased risk of syphilis infection. For example, prevalence of syphilis is higher in men, men who have sex with men, persons with HIV infection, young adults, and persons with a history of incarceration, sex work, or military service.<sup>9,10</sup> A substantial percentage of heterosexual syphilis transmission occurs among persons who use illicit drugs, particularly methamphetamine.<sup>14,15</sup> Diagnosis of another STI may signal that a person is having condomless sex, which increases their risk of syphilis infection.<sup>16</sup> Higher infection rates in persons of some racial and ethnic groups have been reported and are primarily a reflection of a combination of factors, including social determinants of health (eg, disparities of income, low educational achievement, and unstable housing),<sup>6</sup> differential health insurance coverage or access to quality health care,<sup>6</sup> and differences in sexual network characteristics (eg, individuals living in communities with a high prevalence of STIs have an increased chance of encountering an infected partner).<sup>7</sup> Local prevalence rates may change over time, so clinicians should be aware of the latest data and trends for their specific population and geographic area, which are available through their state and local health departments and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) surveillance.<sup>9,10,17</sup></p>\r\n<p>Although direct evidence on screening in nonpregnant persons who are not at increased risk for syphilis infection is lacking, based on the established test performance characteristics of current screening tests and the low prevalence rate of syphilis in this population, the yield of screening is likely low.<sup>9,10</sup> Therefore, screening in this population may result in high false-positive rates and overtreatment.</p>\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>Current syphilis screening tests rely on detection of antibodies rather than direct detection of the organism that causes syphilis, <em>Treponema pallidum</em>. A <em>traditional screening algorithm</em> is a 2-step process involving an initial nontreponemal test (eg, Venereal Disease Research Laboratory [VDRL] or rapid plasma reagin [RPR] test) followed by a confirmatory treponemal antibody detection test (eg, <em>T pallidum</em> particle agglutination [TP-PA] test).<sup>18</sup> A more recently developed <em>reverse sequence algorithm</em> uses an automated treponemal test (eg, enzyme-linked or chemiluminescence immunoassay) for the initial screening, followed by a nontreponemal test for reactive samples.<sup>18</sup> Discordant results in the reverse sequence are resolved with a second confirmatory treponemal test, preferably testing for different antigens than the initial test.<sup>9</sup> Most laboratories perform traditional screening;<sup>19</sup> however, the automated processes used in reverse sequence may be appropriate for high-volume laboratories or areas where populations may be at higher risk for late-stage latent disease that traditional screening may miss.<sup>20</sup><em>&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n<p><em>Rapid point-of-care (POC) testing</em> for antibodies to <em>T pallidum</em> can provide quick on-site results (typically within 5 to 30 minutes); however, initial real-world data show sensitivity may be low.<sup>21</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Screening Intervals</h3>\r\n<p>Optimal screening frequency for persons who are at increased risk for syphilis infection is not well established. Men who have sex with men or persons with HIV infection may benefit from screening at least annually or more frequently (eg, every 3 to 6 months) if they continue to be at high risk.<sup>9,10,16</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The effectiveness of parenteral penicillin G for the treatment of primary, secondary, and latent syphilis is well established. Dosage and the length of treatment depend on the stage and symptoms of the infection. Clinicians are encouraged to refer to the CDC&rsquo;s STI Treatment Guidelines for the most up-to-date treatment guidance.<sup>16</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Implementation</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF did not review evidence on screening for syphilis in persons with HIV infection or taking HIV preexposure prophylaxis if screening was part of disease management. The CDC provides recommendations for these circumstances and other specific groups. The CDC also describes management and follow-up considerations, including interventions to decrease transmission and reinfection.<sup>16</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Additional Tools and Resources</h3>\r\n<p>The CDC provides fact sheets, treatment guidelines, and national and state surveillance data for syphilis (<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/std\">https://www.cdc.gov/std</a>). It also provides guidance for clinicians on providing quality STI clinical services (<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/rr/rr6805a1.htm\">https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/rr/rr6805a1.htm</a>).</p>\r\n<p>The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine provides a comprehensive systems-based approach for prevention and control of STIs (<a href=\"https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/25955/sexually-transmitted-infections-adopting-a-sexual-health-paradigm\">https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/25955/sexually-transmitted-infections-adopting-a-sexual-health-paradigm</a>).</p>\r\n<p>The Community Preventive Services Task Force has issued several recommendations on the prevention of HIV/AIDS, other STIs, and teen pregnancy. The Community Guide discusses interventions that have been efficacious in school settings and for men who have sex with men (<a href=\"https://www.thecommunityguide.org/topic/hiv-stis-and-teen-pregnancy\">https://www.thecommunityguide.org/topic/hiv-stis-and-teen-pregnancy</a>).</p>\r\n<h3>Other Related USPSTF Recommendations</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF has issued a separate recommendation for screening for syphilis infection in pregnant persons<sup>11</sup> as well as screening recommendations for other STIs, including hepatitis B,<sup>22</sup> hepatitis C,<sup>23</sup> genital herpes,<sup>24</sup> HIV,<sup>25</sup> and chlamydia and gonorrhea.<sup>26</sup> The USPSTF has also issued a recommendation on behavioral counseling for all sexually active adolescents and for adults who are at increased risk for STIs.<sup>27</sup></p><h2>Reaffirmation of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h2><p>This recommendation is a reaffirmation of the USPSTF 2016 recommendation statement. In 2016, the USPSTF reviewed the evidence for syphilis screening in nonpregnant adolescents and adults and found convincing evidence that the benefits of screening substantially outweighed the harms (A recommendation).<sup>12</sup> In the current update, the USPSTF found no new substantial evidence that could change its recommendation and, therefore, reaffirms its recommendation to screen for syphilis in nonpregnant adolescents and adults who are at increased risk of infection.</p>","other":"<h2>Recommendations of Others</h2><p>The CDC recommends at least annual screening for syphilis in sexually active men who have sex with men, with confirmatory testing for individuals with reactive serology. The CDC recommends that persons with HIV infection who are sexually active be screened at the first HIV evaluation and at least annually thereafter. Men who have sex with men and persons with HIV infection may benefit from more frequent screening (eg, every 3 to 6 months) based on individual risk behaviors and local epidemiology. The CDC also recommends opt-out syphilis screening in correctional facilities based on the local area and institutional prevalence.<sup>16</sup> The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists does not recommend routine screening for syphilis in persons who are not pregnant.<sup>31</sup> The HIV Medicine Association (part of the Infectious Diseases Society of America) recommends that all patients with HIV infection be screened for syphilis on initiation of care and periodically thereafter, depending on risk.<sup>32</sup> The recommendation of the American Academy of Family Physicians is similar to the USPSTF guidelines for screening for syphilis in persons at increased risk.<sup>33,34</sup></p>","discussion":"<h2>Supporting Evidence</h2><h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n<p>To reaffirm its recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a reaffirmation evidence update. The aim of evidence updates that support the reaffirmation process is to identify if there is new and substantial evidence sufficient enough to change the prior recommendation.<sup>13</sup> The reaffirmation update focuses on targeted key questions evaluating the performance of risk assessment tools and the benefits and harms of screening for syphilis in nonpregnant adolescents and adults. The review also included a more limited literature search comparing testing algorithms and the accuracy of rapid POC tests. Because the USPSTF previously determined that treatments for these infections are effective and well established, this review did not include a review of treatments.</p>\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening Tests and Risk Assessment</h3>\r\n<p>Test accuracy can vary based on disease stage. A literature review showed the sensitivity of commonly used nontreponemal tests, such as RPR and VDRL, ranged from 61% to 78% for detecting primary and late latent syphilis. Sensitivity of these nontreponemal tests for detecting secondary and early latent syphilis ranged from 85% to 100%. Sensitivity of preferred treponemal tests ranged from 82% to 100% across the spectrum of disease. Specificity of preferred treponemal tests for detecting primary syphilis ranged from 94% to 100%.<sup>9,10</sup></p>\r\n<p>There is limited evidence directly comparing the traditional and reverse sequence algorithms. A recent 2020 narrative study reviewed 69 articles summarizing the pros and cons of the 2 algorithms. Findings showed that the nontreponemal test in the traditional algorithm may have decreased sensitivity for detecting primary and latent syphilis. The automated tests used in the reverse sequence algorithm allows for faster processing but may have higher false-positive rates than the traditional algorithm. The study concluded that the traditional algorithm may be more appropriate for smaller laboratories with lower volumes of testing because performing manual nontreponemal screening assays would not significantly affect workflow. Alternatively, the reverse algorithm may be more suitable for either larger laboratories where automated testing processes can improve workflow and efficiency or for smaller laboratories serving higher-risk populations.<sup>20</sup></p>\r\n<p>A 2020 systematic review evaluated rapid POC test performance in laboratory and real-world settings. The study found that the pooled sensitivity from the laboratory evaluations (n = 5) was 98.5% (95% CI, 92.1%-100%), while pooled specificity was 95.9% (95% CI, 81.5%-100.0%). The pooled sensitivity for prospective studies (n = 10) was 87.7% (95% CI, 71.8%-97.2%), while pooled specificity was 96.7% (95% CI, 91.9%-99.2%). However, in 2 of these prospective studies, the sensitivity was only 50%. Differences in testing protocols, training, and specimen collection (eg, sera vs whole-blood samples) are potential factors explaining the inconsistency in test performance between laboratory and real-world POC testing.<sup>21</sup></p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed 1 fair-quality study (n = 361) that evaluated an online calculator for predicting syphilis within the next 3 months in high-risk individuals seeking STI testing or treatment in Peru. The model with the greatest area under the curve (0.69) included the risk factors current HIV infection, history of syphilis infection, number of male sex partners in past 3 months, and sex role for anal sex (receptive or insertive) in the prior 3 months.<sup>28</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed 1 fair-quality Australian cohort study (n = 117,387) examining trends in syphilis testing and detection among sexually active men who have sex with men (68% HIV-negative). During an 8-year follow-up period, the proportion of men tested for syphilis annually increased significantly among both HIV-negative (n = 97,895) and HIV-positive (n = 19,492) men (48% to 91% in HIV-negative men and 42% to 77% in HIV-positive men; <em>P</em> &lt; .001 for trend). Syphilis was detected in 2799 HIV-negative men (3%) and 1032 HIV-positive men (5%). The proportion of early latent infections detected increased from 27% to 44% in HIV-negative men and from 23% to 45% in HIV-positive men (<em>P</em> &lt; .001 for trend), while the proportion of secondary infections decreased from 24% to 19% (<em>P</em> = .03 for trend) and from 45% to 26% (<em>P</em> &lt; .001 for trend) in HIV-positive and negative men, respectively. This study demonstrated that screening in men who have sex with men was associated with greater detection of early asymptomatic syphilis and a decrease in secondary syphilis, suggesting that screening is likely to have interrupted the progression of syphilis.<sup>29</sup></p>\r\n<p>No studies reported the effectiveness of screening on acquisition or transmission of other STIs or other complications such as tertiary syphilis or neurosyphilis. No studies directly addressed effective screening intervals in the included populations.</p>\r\n<p>The effectiveness of penicillin G for the treatment of primary, secondary, and latent syphilis is well established and was not reviewed for this recommendation update.<sup>16</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Screening and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed 1 fair-quality, pre-post design study (n = 1097) examining emotional stress associated with rapid POC STI testing. Participants considered to be in high-risk groups completed a questionnaire assessing emotional stress prior to and after testing for HIV, hepatitis C, and syphilis. Factors associated with increased stress included history of injection drug use, Black race, less than a high school education, and single marital status. The study did not compare changes in the levels of emotional stress pretesting vs posttesting.<sup>30</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from February 15 to March 14, 2022. The USPSTF clarified factors driving disparities in syphilis prevalence among certain populations in the Importance and Practice Considerations sections. The USPSTF clarified preferred screening tests by the CDC as well as test performance of different screening tests in the Practice Considerations and Supporting Evidence sections. Additional risk behaviors were added to the Practice Considerations section to further help identify persons who would benefit from screening.

It also applies to adults with unrecognized symptoms of OSA (eg, snoring, witnessed apnea, excessive daytime sleepiness, impaired cognition, mood changes, or gasping or choking while asleep). This includes persons who are not aware of their symptoms or do not report symptoms as being a concern to their clinician.</p>\r\n<p>This recommendation does not apply to persons presenting with symptoms or concerns about OSA, persons who have been referred for evaluation or treatment of suspected OSA, or persons who have acute conditions that could trigger the onset of OSA (eg, stroke). Care of these persons should be managed as clinically appropriate. This recommendation also does not apply to children, adolescents, or pregnant persons.</p>\r\n<h3>Definitions</h3>\r\n<p>Obstructive sleep apnea is a sleep disorder characterized by episodes of narrowing and obstruction of the pharyngeal airway during sleep, resulting in reductions or cessations in airflow despite ventilatory effort.<sup>5</sup> Total airway obstruction for more than 10 seconds is defined as apnea, whereas hypopnea is a partial airway obstruction with at least a 3% reduction in blood oxygen saturation or sleep arousals.<sup>6</sup> Obstructive sleep apnea is defined as more than 5 apneic, hypoxic, or sleep arousal events per hour despite efforts to breathe. The AHI is used to define the severity of OSA. In general, mild OSA is defined as 5 to 15 events per hour, moderate OSA as 16 to 30 events per hour, and severe OSA as more than 30 events per hour.<sup>6</sup> Common clinical signs and symptoms of OSA include excessive daytime sleepiness, unrefreshing sleep despite length of sleep, loud or irregular snoring, and choking or gasping while asleep.<sup>7</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Risk Factors</h3>\r\n<p>Risk factors associated with OSA include male sex, older age (40-70 years), postmenopausal status, higher body mass index (BMI), and craniofacial and upper airway abnormalities (eg, enlarged tonsils or long upper airway). Black, Hispanic/Latino, and Native American/Alaska Native persons have a higher prevalence of OSA compared with White persons; some evidence suggests that these differences are partially explained by higher rates of obesity, asthma, and tobacco use among these groups.<sup>8</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>There are several screening questionnaires and clinical prediction tools that attempt to identify persons at higher risk of OSA. Many combine questions about clinical findings (eg, BMI and neck circumference) with questions about symptoms associated with OSA. Potential screening questionnaires and clinical prediction tools include the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS),<sup>9</sup> STOP questionnaire (snoring, tiredness, observed apnea, high blood pressure),<sup>10</sup> STOP-BANG questionnaire (STOP questionnaire plus BMI, age, neck circumference, and gender),<sup>11</sup> Berlin Questionnaire,<sup>12</sup> Wisconsin Sleep Questionnaire,<sup>13</sup> and the Multivariable Apnea Prediction tool.<sup>14</sup> However, none of these instruments have been adequately validated in general populations enrolled from primary care settings.<sup>15,16</sup></p>\r\n<p>Persons with suspected OSA are usually diagnosed using polysomnography, which combines several measurements, including an electroencephalogram, electro-oculogram, chin electromyelogram, airflow monitor, oxygen saturation, respiratory effort, and electrocardiogram or heart rate.<sup>15,16</sup> Additional recommended measurements include body position and leg movements.<sup>17</sup> The resultant AHI measured during polysomnography is representative of the frequency of events and used to describe the severity of disease or condition.</p>\r\n<h3>Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>A positive airway pressure device, which uses compressed air to maintain the airway, is the primary treatment for OSA.<sup>15,16</sup> For patients with overweight and obesity, weight loss is also recommended.<sup>4</sup> Mandibular advancement devices (MADs) are an alternative therapy to positive airway pressure for patients with OSA who prefer them or for those with adverse effects associated with positive airway pressure.<sup>15,16</sup> Surgical interventions for OSA are available, but they generally are not considered first-line treatments.<sup>15,16</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>\r\n<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>\r\n<p>The exact prevalence of OSA in unknown; however, the estimated prevalence of OSA in the US population has increased in the past few decades. For example, the diagnosis of OSA in the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey rose by 442% between 1999 and 2010.<sup>18</sup> This is primarily attributed to the increase in prevalence of obesity.<sup>1,2</sup> Obstructive sleep apnea is associated with multiple adverse health outcomes such as cognitive impairment, motor vehicle crashes, lost work days, work disability, impaired work performance, and decreased quality of life.<sup>15,16</sup> Obstructive sleep apnea has also been associated with cardiovascular disease (eg, coronary heart disease, stroke, or hypertension), type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome.<sup>15,16</sup> While OSA is associated with increased all-cause mortality, its role independent of other risk factors (older age, higher BMI, and other cardiovascular risk factors), as well as the role of progression rates of OSA from mild to severe disease, is less clear.<sup>15,16</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Potential Harms</h4>\r\n<p>Commonly reported harms of treatment with positive airway pressure include oral or nasal dryness, eye or skin irritation, rash, and pain. Reported harms of treatment with MADs include oral mucosal, dental, or jaw symptoms, such as mucosal or dental pain, discomfort or tenderness, mucosal erosions, and jaw or temporomandibular joint pain or discomfort.<sup>15,16</sup> In general, the adverse events related to positive airway pressure and MAD therapy resolve with discontinuation of treatment.</p>\r\n<h4>Current Practice</h4>\r\n<p>Most primary care clinicians do not routinely screen for OSA, and most patients do not discuss sleep-related symptoms with their primary care clinicians. One study found that only 20% of patients with sleep-related symptoms spontaneously reported them to their primary care clinicians.<sup>15,16,19</sup> For persons with suspected OSA, current practice is usually referral to a specialist for appropriate diagnostic testing and treatment.<sup>20</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h3>\r\n<p>This recommendation replaces the 2017 USPSTF recommendation on screening for OSA. In 2017, the USPSTF found insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for OSA in asymptomatic adults (I statement). This recommendation statement is consistent with the I statement from 2017.<sup>21</sup></p>","other":"<h2>Recommendations of Others</h2><p>Most groups do not recommend routine screening in primary care settings among populations without signs or symptoms of OSA. US Department of Veterans Affairs guidelines suggest using the STOP questionnaire to stratify the risk of OSA among patients who report sleep issues (weak recommendation) and also suggest assessing for sleep-disordered breathing in patients with a history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events, congestive heart failure, and chronic opioid use (weak recommendation).<sup>22</sup> The American Academy of Sleep Medicine has a health advisory recommending annual OSA screening for adult patients who belong to certain high-risk groups.<sup>23</sup> In 2014, the American College of Physicians recommended conducting a sleep study for patients with unexplained daytime sleepiness (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence).<sup>24</sup></p>","discussion":"<h2>Supporting Evidence</h2><h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF commissioned a systematic review to evaluate the benefits and harms of screening for OSA in adults.<sup>15,16</sup> The systematic review also evaluated the evidence on the benefits and harms of treatment of OSA on intermediate outcomes (eg, change in AHI and blood pressure) and health outcomes (eg, mortality, quality of life, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, and cognitive impairment).</p>\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening Tests and Risk Assessment</h3>\r\n<p>Seven studies assessed 1 or more clinical prediction tools or screening questionnaires compared with facility-based polysomnography: 2 studies assessed the Berlin Questionnaire, 4 studies the STOP-BANG questionnaire, and 2 studies the Multivariable Apnea Prediction tool. Study sizes ranged from 43 to 1033 participants, and studies were generally conducted in participants with underlying conditions such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes, or Alzheimer disease or in persons with symptoms.<sup>15,16</sup> The Berlin Questionnaire had sensitivity ranging from 37% to 80% and specificity ranging from 0% to 84% for detecting mild OSA. In the 2 studies evaluating the original STOP-BANG questionnaire, both found good sensitivity (87% to 94%) but low specificity (0% to 38%) for detecting OSA at different AHI cut points.<sup>15,16</sup> Two studies assessed a modified version of the STOP-BANG questionnaire (different scoring criteria) in different populations; sensitivity ranged from 61% to 100% and specificity ranged from 21% to 76% for detecting OSA at different AHI cut points.<sup>15,16</sup></p>\r\n<p>In the 2 studies that assessed the Multivariable Apnea Prediction tool alone and when followed by an unattended home sleep test, sensitivity ranged between 88% and 92% and specificity ranged between 44% and 76% to predict severe OSA syndrome (defined in the study as AHI &ge;30 and ESS score &gt;10).<sup>15,16</sup> However, these studies were conducted in populations that had a high prevalence of OSA (and thus more likely to be symptomatic) and a high risk of spectrum bias (ie, the study population did not represent the general primary care population).</p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no studies that directly evaluated the effect of screening for OSA on health outcomes. The USPSTF did identify and review studies on the effect of treatment on intermediate outcomes and health outcomes.</p>\r\n<h4>Intermediate Outcomes</h4>\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed evidence from 4 systematic reviews of good-quality treatment trials evaluating the effect of positive airway pressure or MADs on intermediate outcomes, including AHI and blood pressure.<sup>15,16</sup></p>\r\n<p>Three systematic reviews focused on the benefit of positive airway pressure for reducing blood pressure outcomes. One review limited to minimally symptomatic, asymptomatic, or nonsleepy populations pooled data comparing positive airway pressure with controls and demonstrated an association with a small reduction in daytime diastolic blood pressure (&minus;0.92 mm Hg [95% CI, &minus;1.39 to &minus;0.46 mm Hg]; 5 trials; 1541 participants; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 0) and no significant difference between groups in daytime systolic blood pressure (&minus;0.51 mm Hg [95% CI, &minus;3.39 to 2.38 mm Hg]; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 84%). A second review of positive airway pressure that included trials of any OSA severity and symptoms pooled analyses and showed that positive airway pressure was associated with a reduction in mean 24-hour blood pressure of &minus;2.63 mm Hg (95% CI, &minus;3.86 to &minus;1.39 mm Hg; 8 trials; 994 participants; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 0%).<sup>8</sup> The third review of positive airway pressure was limited to populations with resistant hypertension (23 trials; 4905 participants); pooled analysis showed a reduction in mean 24-hour systolic blood pressure (&minus;5.06 mm Hg [95% CI, &minus;7.98 to 2.13 mm Hg]; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 84%) and mean 24-hour diastolic blood pressure (&minus;4.21 mm Hg [95% CI, &minus;6.50 to &minus;1.93 mm Hg]; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 81%). One review found benefits associated with MADs compared with inactive control for improving blood pressure; however, differences between groups were imprecise and not statistically significant.<sup>15,16</sup></p>\r\n<p>Two reviews reported on the difference between groups in change from baseline AHI with positive airway pressure. The pooled estimates in AHI reduction favoring positive airway pressure were generally consistent. The review that limited inclusion to studies of asymptomatic adults with OSA or those of minimally symptomatic, nonsleepy adults found a pooled mean difference of &minus;15.57 events per hour (95% CI, &minus;29.32 to &minus;1.82 events per hour; 3 trials; 1541 participants).<sup>15,16</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Health Outcomes: Positive Airway Pressure Devices</h4>\r\n<p>Sixty-three randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing positive airway pressure with sham treatment or another inactive control reported on at least 1 health outcome. Most trials enrolled participants from sleep clinics, and no trial enrolled screen-detected populations from a primary care setting.<sup>15,16</sup></p>\r\n<p>Thirty-one RCTs reported on mortality; however, 28 of these trials reported mortality rates at 12 weeks or less, and 25 of these trials reported no deaths in any study group. Three RCTs assessed mortality over a longer duration, and none found a statistically significant difference between groups. Similarly, the short duration of most trials and the small number of total events makes it difficult to assess the effect of positive airway pressure on cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events.<sup>15,16</sup></p>\r\n<p>Forty-eight trials reported on changes in excessive daytime sleepiness using the ESS. The meta-analysis found that positive airway pressure was associated with reduced mean ESS scores more than controls (pooled mean difference, &minus;2.30 [95% CI, &minus;2.72 to &minus;1.88]; 48 trials; 7099 participants). This pooled mean difference is within the range some consider as minimally clinically important for the ESS (&minus;2 to &minus;3).<sup>15,16</sup></p>\r\n<p>Twenty-eight RCTs reported measures of general health&ndash;related quality of life and 17 RCTs reported measures of sleep-related quality of life (using a variety of questionnaires). Overall, positive airway pressure was associated with small improvements in both general health-related and sleep-related quality of life. However, these improvements are not considered clinically meaningful (ie, less than a minimal clinically important difference).<sup>15,16</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Health Outcomes: MADs</h4>\r\n<p>Twelve trials assessed the effect of MADs on health outcomes. All studies recruited participants with known or suspected OSA from specialty clinics. Treatment duration ranged from 4 to 12 weeks in most trials.<sup>15,16</sup></p>\r\n<p>Ten trials were included in a meta-analysis reporting on change in ESS score among groups randomized to MADs or an inactive control. It found that MADs were associated with improved ESS scores more than controls (pooled mean difference, &minus;1.67 [95% CI, &minus;2.09 to &minus;1.25]; 10 trials; 1540 participants; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 36%); however, this change falls below the range considered a minimal clinically important difference for the ESS.<sup>15,16</sup> Several studies reported on various quality-of-life metrics. Overall, the findings were inconsistent or imprecise, making it difficult to draw conclusions on the quality-of-life benefits related to MADs. Four trials reported on mortality; however, the duration of reporting was short (1 to 12 weeks) and only 1 death was reported in the intervention group.<sup>15,16</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Screening and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no studies that directly evaluated harms associated with screening for OSA. Nineteen trials reported on harms associated with treatment of OSA using positive airway pressure or MADs. In general, reporting on harms related to treatment was sparse, and no trial included screen-detected persons identified from a primary care setting.<sup>15,16</sup></p>\r\n<p>Ten studies (n = 2064) reported on harms of treatment with positive airway pressure. Follow-up in these studies was generally from 8 to 12 weeks. Overall, 1% to 47% of trial participants reported any harms from treatment with positive airway pressure, including oral or nasal dryness, eye or skin irritation, rash, epistaxis, and pain. In general, harms related to positive airway pressure treatment were short-lived and could be alleviated by discontinuing treatment or by supplementing positive airway pressure with additional interventions.<sup>15,16</sup></p>\r\n<p>Ten trials (n = 684) reported on harms of treatment with MADs. Follow-up in these trials was generally from 4 to 8 weeks. In general, findings were imprecise. In 7 trials, 17% to 74% of participants reported oral mucosal, dental, or jaw symptoms, compared with 0% to 17% of participants in comparator groups (sham treatment, no treatment, or conservative management). In 4 trials, 5% to 33% of participants reported oral dryness, compared with 0% to 3% in control groups, and in 3 trials, 23% to 68% of participants reported excessive salivation, compared with 0% to 3% in comparator groups.<sup>15,16</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from March 29, 2022, to April 25, 2022. Some comments expressed concern that the recommendation statement does not adequately differentiate persons who are asymptomatic from those with unrecognized symptoms. In response, the USPSTF added clarifying language to describe common symptoms of OSA and defined what is meant by persons with unrecognized symptoms. Comments also proposed that the USPSTF call for screening in patients considered at higher risk. The USPSTF recognizes that certain groups are at increased risk of OSA but did not find any studies that directly evaluated the effect of screening for OSA on health outcomes. The USPSTF wishes to clarify that its I statement is neither a recommendation for nor against screening. Clinicians should continue to use their clinical judgment to determine if screening is appropriate for individual patients. Comments asked why the recommendation statement focused only on positive airway pressure and MADs and excluded surgical interventions. The focus of this recommendation is first-line therapies for OSA. Surgical therapies are typically reserved for patients who do not respond to first-line therapies or have more severe symptoms (and thus are less likely to be asymptomatic or referred from primary care).</p>\r\n<p>Several respondents asked the USPSTF to specify the types of studies it needs to fill evidence gaps and to consider study types other than RCTs. The USPSTF wishes to clarify that there are no generic criteria (ie, only considering RCTs) for the types of evidence it would consider for review. The criteria for consideration depend on the type and quality of evidence the USPSTF needs to make an accurate determination of benefits and harms of delivering a preventive health service.</p><h2>Research Needs and Gaps</h2><p>More studies are needed that address the following areas.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Well-designed studies of OSA screening in asymptomatic populations representative of the US primary care population that evaluate the benefits and harms of screening on health outcomes (eg, mortality, cardiovascular disease events, motor vehicle crashes, and quality of life) in screened vs unscreened persons.</li>\r\n<li>Accuracy studies of screening tools in a general US adult primary care population, especially in persons with unrecognized or mild symptoms.</li>\r\n<li>Development of accurate risk assessment tools that can identify populations most likely to benefit from OSA screening.</li>\r\n<li>More data on the natural history of OSA; in particular, the rates of progression from mild to severe OSA, the length of duration before progression, and the magnitude of benefit if OSA is identified and treated earlier.</li>\r\n</ul>","topic":"Obstructive Sleep Apnea in Adults: Screening","keywords":"Obstructive Sleep Apnea|Sleep Apnea|Sleep Disorder|Snoring|OSA|CPAP|positive airway pressure","pubDate":"2022-11-15","categories":["4","10"],"tool":["446","448","447"]},"714":{"topicType":"Screening","topicYear":2023,"uspstfAlias":"skin-cancer-screening","specific":[2005],"title":"Skin Cancer: Screening","rationale":"<h2>Importance</h2><p>Skin cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in the US.<sup>1</sup> There are different types of skin cancer varying in disease incidence and severity.

It does not apply to symptomatic patients, including those who present with a suspicious skin lesion, or those already under surveillance because of a high risk of skin cancer, such as persons with a familial syndrome (eg, familial atypical mole and melanoma syndrome).</p>\r\n<h3>Definitions</h3>\r\n<p>Keratinocyte carcinoma, previously referred to as nonmelanoma skin cancer, consists of basal and squamous cell carcinomas.<sup>2</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>A visual skin examination is the most commonly proposed method for skin cancer screening and includes a survey of the body for skin lesions. A common technique used by clinicians to assess a potential melanoma is the &ldquo;ABCDE&rdquo; rule, which looks for lesions with the following characteristics: asymmetry, border irregularity, nonuniform color, diameter greater than 6 mm, and evolution over time. Another approach for visual skin examination is the &ldquo;ugly duckling&rdquo; sign, in which the clinician identifies pigmented lesions that look different than other moles on the patient. Visual skin examination can be performed with either the naked eye or a magnifying device called a dermatoscope. Biopsy of a suspicious lesion is needed to definitively diagnose skin cancer.<sup>8</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>Melanoma is generally treated by surgically removing the primary tumor and surrounding normal tissue and possibly taking a biopsy of the sentinel lymph node to determine stage.</p>\r\n<p>Immunotherapy and targeted therapy are also used to treat advanced melanoma. There are several treatments for keratinocyte carcinoma, including surgical excision, Mohs micrographic surgery, radiation therapy, electrodessication and curettage, and photodynamic therapy, among others.<sup>8</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>\r\n<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>\r\n<p>Skin cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in the US.<sup>1</sup> Melanoma, which constitutes 1% of skin cancer, causes more skin cancer deaths than keratinocyte carcinoma. An estimated 98,000 new cases of melanoma will be diagnosed in the US in 2023, with 8000 associated deaths.<sup>3</sup> Estimated 5-year survival for melanoma ranges from 99.5% for localized-stage disease to 31.9% for distant-stage disease.<sup>11</sup> Because keratinocyte carcinoma is common and usually curable, it is not monitored by cancer registries and reliable epidemiologic data are not available. However, emerging evidence indicates that mortality data for squamous cell carcinoma may be underestimated.<sup>2,8</sup></p>\r\n<p>Exposure to UV radiation from sun exposure, indoor tanning beds, and other UV radiation&ndash;emitting devices is the major environmental risk factor for skin cancer. History of frequent sunburns, older age, and male sex are associated with increased risk for skin cancer. Exposure to UV radiation from the use of indoor tanning beds is an important risk factor in adolescents. Incidence of melanoma is higher among White persons compared with persons of other races and ethnicities. This difference likely reflects traits associated with increased melanoma risk, such as fair skin (which is more susceptible to sunburning), light-colored eyes, and red or blond hair being more common among White persons compared with persons of other races and ethnicities.<sup>8</sup> Acral lentiginous melanoma, which occurs mostly on skin not frequently exposed to direct sunlight (eg, palms of hands, soles of feet, or under fingernails or toenails), is the most common type of melanoma among Black populations.<sup>8,12</sup> Other melanoma risk factors include higher numbers of moles on the skin, atypical moles, as well as a personal and family history of skin cancer.<sup>8</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Potential Harms</h4>\r\n<p>Trial evidence on the harms of skin cancer screening is limited. Potential harms include cosmetic harms (eg, scarring) from diagnostic workup, psychosocial harms (eg, worry) from the screening process, and overdiagnosis leading to overtreatment.<sup>8,13</sup> Treatment harms vary in frequency and severity depending on treatment type. Harms tend to be infrequent and less severe for local excisional treatments, whereas systemic treatments like chemotherapy or immunotherapy have the potential for more common and severe harms.<sup>8</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Current Practice</h4>\r\n<p>Contemporary data on clinician practice patterns related to skin cancer screening are limited. Available studies show that the majority of melanomas are detected either by the patient discovering the lesion and reporting it to their clinician or by the clinician finding it incidentally.<sup>14</sup> In 1 study, survey data showed that dermatologists perform more skin cancer screening examinations than family practice clinicians or internists (552 [81.3%] dermatologists vs 333 [59.6%] family practice clinicians vs 243 [56.4%] internists).<sup>15</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Additional Tools and Resources</h3>\r\n<p>The Community Preventive Services Task Force recommends interventions for skin cancer prevention in child care centers; primary and middle schools; outdoor occupational, recreational, and tourism settings; and communities (<a href=\"https://www.thecommunityguide.org/\">https://www.thecommunityguide.org/</a>).<sup>16</sup></p>\r\n<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&rsquo;s Melanoma Dashboard provides state and local data for melanoma incidence and mortality, UV radiation levels, and other risk factors. These geography-specific data can help communities better meet their unique melanoma prevention needs (<a href=\"http://ephtracking.cdc.gov/Applications/melanomadashboard/\">http://ephtracking.cdc.gov/Applications/melanomadashboard/</a>).<sup>17</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Other Related USPSTF Recommendations</h3>\r\n<p>In a separate recommendation, the USPSTF recommends counseling all young adults, adolescents, children, and parents of young children about minimizing exposure to UV radiation for persons aged 6 months to 24 years with a fair skin type to reduce their risk of skin cancer (B recommendation) and selectively offering counseling (based on risk factors) to adults older than 24 years with a fair skin type (C recommendation). The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of counseling adults about skin self-examination for skin cancer prevention (I statement).<sup>18</sup></p><h2>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h2><p>In 2016, the USPSTF found insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of visual skin examination by a clinician to screen for skin cancer in adults (I statement).<sup>19</sup> This recommendation concurs with the previous I statement.</p>","other":"<h2>Supporting Evidence</h2><h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF commissioned a systematic review to evaluate the benefits and harms of screening for skin cancer in asymptomatic adolescents and adults.<sup>8,20</sup> The review included evidence for both keratinocyte carcinoma and cutaneous melanoma. The USPSTF used foundational evidence from previous reviews to assess the diagnostic accuracy of visual skin examination by a clinician to detect skin cancer.</p>\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening Tests and Risk Assessment</h3>\r\n<p>Based on foundational evidence, the sensitivity of visual skin examination by a clinician (eg, primary care clinician, dermatologist, or plastic surgeon) to detect melanoma ranged from 40% to 70% and specificity ranged from 86% to 98%. Evidence evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of visual skin examination to detect keratinocyte carcinoma was limited and inconsistent.<sup>19</sup> No new studies from the current review reported diagnostic accuracy for an asymptomatic screening population.<sup>8,20</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed 3 nonrandomized studies evaluating 2 skin cancer screening programs in Germany. One fair-quality study (SCREEN; n = 360,288 screened) included in the previous review measured melanoma mortality in 1 region of Germany before and after implementing a population-based skin cancer screening program. The screening program consisted of clinician education and training, a public awareness campaign, and clinical skin examinations for 1 year. At the 5-year follow-up, melanoma mortality declined 49% in the screening region compared with surrounding areas without a screening program. However, this mortality benefit attenuated at the 10-year follow-up, with melanoma mortality returning to similar rates as at program initiation.<sup>8,20,21</sup></p>\r\n<p>Following the initial positive outcomes from the SCREEN trial, Germany implemented a nationwide routine skin cancer screening program covered by statutory health insurance. This program included clinician education and free total skin examinations every 2 years by either a participating primary care clinician or dermatologist. One fair-quality study (N not reported) compared melanoma mortality between Germany and 22 other European countries and found that the annual melanoma mortality rate increased, not decreased, prior to and after implementation of the German national screening program. The mean unadjusted melanoma mortality rate per 100,000 population in Germany increased from 2.7 deaths to 3.4 deaths after initiation of the national screening program. Melanoma mortality rates increased in other European countries throughout the same period but not as much as in Germany. These data suggested that there is no observable melanoma mortality benefit from a national skin cancer screening program.<sup>8,20,22</sup></p>\r\n<p>Another nonrandomized but good-quality study (n = 1,431,327) from the German national skin cancer screening program found a higher proportion of melanoma deaths in the unscreened group compared with the screened group during a 4-year observation period (171 deaths [9.5% of the screened group] vs 154 deaths [22.8% of the unscreened group]; unadjusted hazard ratio, 0.37 [95% CI, 0.30-0.46]; <em>P</em> &lt; .05). However, this difference was attenuated on multivariate analysis and after adjustment for lead time bias.<sup>8,20,23</sup></p>\r\n<p>The ecological and nonrandomized design of the German screening studies limits the conclusions that can be drawn about the effectiveness of clinical skin cancer screening on melanoma mortality. No included studies reported outcomes for keratinocyte carcinoma mortality or all-cause mortality. The applicability to US settings is also difficult to assess because the population diversity and health care delivery in the US differ from the characteristics in available studies.<sup>8,20</sup></p>\r\n<p>Given the limitations in studies evaluating the direct effect of skin cancer screening on mortality, the USPSTF reviewed evidence for an indirect pathway that evaluated whether screening is associated with earlier detection of skin cancer or precancerous lesions and whether earlier detection reduces melanoma and all-cause mortality. The USPSTF reviewed 6 nonrandomized observational studies (n = 2,947,595) assessing the effectiveness of skin cancer screening on earlier detection (measured by cancer stage or lesion thickness). Results were either inconsistent or showed no association between routine clinician skin examination and increased detection of keratinocyte carcinoma, melanoma, or skin cancer precursor lesions compared with usual care or lesion-directed examination.<sup>8,20</sup></p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed 9 nonrandomized studies (n = 1,326,051) assessing the association between stage at diagnosis and melanoma or all-cause mortality. Results showed that there is a strong, consistent positive association between more advanced stage at melanoma detection and increasing melanoma and all-cause mortality risk.<sup>8,20</sup> For example, 1 good-quality US-based study (n = 185,219) showed that compared with in situ disease at detection, the adjusted hazard ratios for melanoma mortality were 5.8 (95% CI, 5.3-6.3) for localized stage, 31.5 (95% CI, 28.9-34.2) for regional stage, and 169.6 (95% CI, 154.2-186.6) for distant stage. Regarding all-cause mortality, the same pattern was observed; the adjusted hazard ratios for all-cause mortality were 1.5 (95% CI, 1.5-1.5) for localized stage, 3.9 (95% CI, 3.8-4.1) for regional stage, and 15.8 (95% CI, 14.9-16.7) for distant stage, compared with in situ melanoma at detection.<sup>24</sup> US-based studies also showed higher melanoma mortality risk at all stages among men compared with women, and at stage 1 among Asian American, Black, Hispanic, Native American, and Pacific Islander adults compared with White adults. No evidence was available assessing the association between stage at keratinocyte carcinoma detection and skin cancer or all-cause mortality.<sup>8,20</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Screening and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed 2 small fair-quality nonrandomized studies evaluating the harms of skin cancer screening. A fair-quality study (n = 45) in Germany described patient ratings of cosmetic acceptance of deep shave excisions after 6 months. Patients judged 7% of shave sites as having poor cosmetic outcomes.<sup>25</sup> A fair-quality US-based study (n = 187) used various scales to estimate patient-reported psychological harms (eg, anxiety, depression, and physical and social consequences) and health-related quality of life at 5 and 8 months after screening with visual examination and subsequent diagnostic biopsy as indicated. Scores in both the screened and unscreened groups were within the normal range on all measures, indicating there were no significant psychological effects.<sup>8,20,26,27</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from October 25, 2022, to November 21, 2022. In response to comments, the USPSTF provided more information on the risk of melanoma in individuals with darker skin color in the Practice Considerations section. The USPSTF also clarified the difference between asymptomatic and symptomatic patient populations in the Practice Considerations section. Comments inquired about screening in higher-risk populations. Due to the lack of available data applicable to a diverse US population, the USPSTF is recommending neither for nor against screening for skin cancer in an asymptomatic population. As such, health care professionals are encouraged to use their clinical judgment when deciding whether to perform a visual skin examination. Comments suggested alternate terms to describe differences in skin color. The USPSTF is committed to using inclusive language in its recommendations and acknowledges that inclusive language and terminology continues to evolve. Terminology used in this recommendation statement reflects current medical terms, clear language principles, and how skin color was reported in included studies.</p><h2>Research Needs and Gaps</h2><p>Studies are needed that provide the following information.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Consistent data showing the effects of screening on morbidity and mortality or early detection of skin cancer, particularly melanoma.</li>\r\n<li>Clearer descriptions of skin color and inclusion of a full spectrum of skin colors in study participants.</li>\r\n<li>Morbidity and mortality outcomes in participants reflective of a US population with a diversity of skin tones.</li>\r\n<li>The effectiveness of screening in a range of primary care settings that reflect the variation in access to care in the US.</li>\r\n<li>The effectiveness of screening for reducing morbidity and mortality of acral lentiginous melanoma, which is the most frequently diagnosed melanoma in persons with darker skin color.</li>\r\n<li>Validated risk assessment tools to identify persons at highest risk for skin cancer and who might benefit from screening.</li>\r\n<li>The impact of social determinants of health (eg, outdoor occupational exposure, geographic exposure differences, and access to quality care) on skin cancer risk, prevention, screening, and treatment.</li>\r\n</ul><h2>Recommendations of Others</h2><p>Currently, no professional organizations in the US recommend clinical visual examination for skin cancer screening.

This is because the net benefit estimates are driven by sex (ie, female) rather than gender identity, although the studies reviewed for this recommendation generally used the term &ldquo;women.&rdquo; These recommendations apply to persons who have factors associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, such as a family history of breast cancer (ie, a first-degree relative with breast cancer) or having dense breasts. They do not apply to persons who have a genetic marker or syndrome associated with a high risk of breast cancer (eg, <em>BRCA1</em> or <em>BRCA2 </em>genetic variation), a history of high-dose radiation therapy to the chest at a young age, or previous breast cancer or a high-risk breast lesion on previous biopsies. Of note, the USPSTF has a separate recommendation on risk assessment, genetic counseling, and genetic testing for BRCA-related cancer,<sup>8</sup> and family history is a common feature of risk assessment tools that help determine likelihood of <em>BRCA1</em> or <em>BRCA2</em> genetic variation.</p>\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>Both digital mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT, or &ldquo;3D mammography&rdquo;) are effective mammographic screening modalities. DBT must be accompanied by traditional digital mammography or synthetic digital mammography, which is a 2-dimensional image constructed from DBT data;<sup>9,10</sup> hereafter, references to DBT will imply concurrent use with digital mammography or synthetic digital mammography. In general, studies have reported small increases in positive predictive value with DBT compared with digital mammography. Trials reporting on at least 2 consecutive rounds of screening have generally found no statistically significant difference in breast cancer detection or in tumor characteristics (tumor size, histologic grade, or node status) when comparing screening with DBT vs digital mammography.<sup>4</sup></p>\r\n<p>The Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) is a network of 6 active breast imaging registries and 2 historic registries, providing a large observational database related to breast cancer screening.<sup>11</sup> Collaborative modeling, using inputs from BCSC data, suggests similar benefits and fewer false-positive results with DBT compared with digital mammography.<sup>12,13</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Screening Interval</h3>\r\n<p>Available evidence suggests that biennial screening has a more favorable trade-off of benefits vs harms than annual screening. BCSC data showed no difference in detection of cancers stage IIB or higher and cancers with less favorable prognostic characteristics with annual vs biennial screening interval for any age group,<sup>14</sup> and modeling data estimate that biennial screening has a more favorable balance of benefits to harms (eg, life-years gained or breast cancer deaths averted per false-positive result) compared with annual screening.<sup>12</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Treatment or Intervention</h3>\r\n<p>Breast cancer treatment regimens are highly individualized according to each patient&rsquo;s clinical status, cancer stage, tumor biomarkers, clinical subtype, and personal preferences.<sup>15</sup> Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a noninvasive condition with abnormal cells in the breast duct lining with uncertainty regarding its prognostic significance. Consequently, there is clinical variability in the treatment approach when DCIS is identified at screening. It is unknown what proportion of screen-detected DCIS represents overdiagnosis (ie, a lesion that would not have led to health problems in the absence of detection by screening). In general, DCIS treatment, which may include surgery, radiation, and endocrine treatment, is intended to reduce the risk for future invasive breast cancer.</p>\r\n<h3>Disparities in Breast Cancer Outcomes and Implementation Considerations</h3>\r\n<p>Mortality from breast cancer is highest for Black women, even when accounting for differences in age and stage at diagnosis; mortality is approximately 40% higher for Black women (5-year age-adjusted mortality rate, 27.6 per 100,000 women) compared with White women (5-year age-adjusted mortality rate, 19.7 per 100,000 women).<sup>6</sup> While the underlying causes of this disparity are complex, the National Institute of Minority Health and Disparities has developed a framework that recognizes multiple determinants, including the health care system, the sociocultural and built environments, behavioral factors, and genetic factors, that can contribute to health inequities.<sup>16</sup> Inequities in breast cancer mortality can be examined at each step along the cancer screening, diagnosis, treatment, and survival pathway with these factors in mind. The higher mortality rate for Black women diagnosed with breast cancer in the US aligns with other health inequities that are attributed to the effects of structural racism, which include inequalities in resources, harmful exposures, and access to and delivery of high-quality health care.<sup>17-19</sup><sup> </sup>Racial and economic residential segregation driven by discriminatory housing policies has been associated with increased exposure to toxic environments such as air pollution, industrial waste, and built environments that do not support health, and stressful life conditions. Residential segregation has also been associated with both an increased risk of triple-negative breast cancer and poorer breast cancer&ndash;specific survival in Black women.<sup>20-22</sup></p>\r\n<p>Black women have a higher incidence of breast cancer with at least 1 negative molecular marker, and the incidence of triple-negative cancers (ie, ER&ndash;, PR&ndash;, and HER2&ndash;) is twice as high in Black women compared with White women (24.2 vs 12.3 cases per 100,000 women).<sup>5</sup> The higher incidence of negative hormonal receptor status leads to worse outcomes because these subtypes are less readily detected through screening and less responsive to current therapy,<sup>23</sup> and triple-negative cancers are more likely to be aggressive and diagnosed at later stages than other subtypes. It is important to note that observed regional differences in the incidence of hormonal receptor&ndash;negative cancer within and between racial groups suggest that environmental factors and social determinants of health, including racism, are largely responsible for the differential risk of developing hormonal receptor&ndash;negative cancer.<sup>24,25</sup> Although variation in the incidence of cancer subtypes explains some of the differences in breast cancer mortality, racial differences in mortality within subtypes point to barriers to obtaining high-quality health care and disparities in screening follow-up and treatment initiation as contributors.<sup>24</sup></p>\r\n<p>Of note, Black women have a rate of self-reported mammography screening similar to or higher than that for all women (84.5% vs 78%, respectively, in the past 2 years), based on 2020 data.<sup>4</sup> However, benefits from mammography screening require initiation and completion of appropriate and effective follow-up evaluation and treatment. Both screening and guideline-concordant treatment are essential for reducing breast cancer mortality,<sup>26</sup> highlighting the importance of timely and effective treatment at the earliest stage of diagnosis. Delays and inadequacies in the diagnostic and treatment pathway downstream from screening likely contribute to increased mortality compared with women receiving prompt, effective care.</p>\r\n<p>Disparities in follow-up after screening and treatment have been observed for Asian, Black, and Hispanic women.<sup>27-36</sup> Adjuvant endocrine therapy reduces the risk of cancer recurrence among individuals with hormonal receptor&ndash;positive cancers, but long-term adherence can be difficult. Black women are more likely to discontinue adjuvant endocrine therapy compared with White women, in part due to greater physical (vasomotor, musculoskeletal, or cardiorespiratory) and psychological (distress or despair) symptom burdens.<sup>35,36</sup> Improvements in access to effective health care, removal of financial barriers, and use of support services to ensure equitable follow-up after screening and timely and effective treatment of breast cancer have the potential to reduce mortality for individuals experiencing disparities related to racism, rural location,<sup>37</sup> low income, or other factors associated with lower breast cancer survival.</p>\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>\r\n<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>\r\n<p>Breast cancer incidence increases with age and peaks among persons aged 70 to 74 years, although rates in persons 75 years or older remain high (453.3 and 409.9 cases per 100,000 women aged 75 to 79 and 80 to 84 years, respectively, compared with 468.2 cases per 100,000 women aged 70 to 74 years), and mortality from breast cancer increases with increasing age.<sup>38,39</sup> However, no randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of breast cancer screening included women 75 years or older.<sup>4</sup> Collaborative modeling suggests that screening in women 75 years or older is of benefit,<sup>12</sup> but a trial emulation found no benefit with breast cancer screening in women aged 75 to 84 years.<sup>40</sup> Thus, there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening mammography in women 75 years or older.</p>\r\n<p>In women with dense breasts who have an otherwise normal mammogram result, there is insufficient evidence about the effect of supplemental screening using breast ultrasonography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on health outcomes such as breast cancer morbidity and mortality. Dense breasts are associated with both reduced sensitivity and specificity of mammography and with an increased risk of breast cancer.<sup>41,42</sup> However, increased breast density itself is not associated with higher breast cancer mortality among women diagnosed with breast cancer, after adjustment for stage, treatment, method of detection, and other risk factors, according to data from the BCSC.<sup>43</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Potential Harms</h4>\r\n<p>Potential harms of screening mammography include false-positive results, which may lead to psychological harms,<sup>44</sup> additional testing, and invasive follow-up procedures; overdiagnosis and overtreatment of lesions that would not have led to health problems in the absence of detection by screening; and radiation exposure.</p>\r\n<h4>Current Practice</h4>\r\n<p>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data show that as of 2015, more than 50% of women 75 years or older reported having a mammogram within the past 2 years.<sup>45</sup> At present, 38 states and the District of Columbia require patient notification of breast density when mammography is performed; in some states, legislation also includes notification language informing women that they should consider adjunctive screening.<sup>46</sup> Starting in September 2024, the US Food and Drug Administration will require mammography centers to notify patients of their breast density, inform them that dense breast tissue increases the risk of breast cancer and makes it harder to detect on a mammogram, and that other imaging tests may help to find cancer.<sup>47</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Additional Tools and Resources</h3>\r\n<p>The National Cancer Institute has information on breast cancer screening for health care professionals (<a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/types/breast/hp/breast-screening-pdq\">https://www.cancer.gov/types/breast/hp/breast-screening-pdq</a>) and for patients (<a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/types/breast/patient/breast-screening-pdq\">https://www.cancer.gov/types/breast/patient/breast-screening-pdq</a>).</p>\r\n<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has information on breast cancer screening (<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/breast/basic_info/screening.htm\">https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/breast/basic_info/screening.htm</a>).</p>\r\n<h3>Other Related USPSTF Recommendations</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF has made recommendations about the use of medications to reduce women&rsquo;s risk for breast cancer<sup>48</sup> as well as risk assessment, genetic counseling, and genetic testing for <em>BRCA1</em>- or <em>BRCA2</em>-related cancer.<sup>8</sup></p>","other":"<h2>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h2><p>This recommendation updates the 2016 recommendation on breast cancer screening. In 2016, the USPSTF recommended biennial screening mammography for women aged 50 to 74 years and individualizing the decision to undergo screening for women aged 40 to 49 years, based on factors such as individual risk and personal preferences and values. The USPSTF concluded that the evidence was insufficient to assess the benefits and harms of DBT as a primary screening method; the balance of benefits and harms of adjunctive screening for breast cancer using breast ultrasonography, MRI, or DBT in women identified to have dense breasts on an otherwise negative screening mammogram; and the balance of benefits and harms of screening mammography in women 75 years or older.<sup>49</sup> For the current recommendation, the USPSTF recommends biennial screening mammography for women aged 40 to 74 years. The USPSTF again finds that the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of supplemental screening for breast cancer using breast ultrasonography or MRI in women identified to have dense breasts on an otherwise negative screening mammogram and the balance of benefits and harms of screening mammography in women 75 years or older. Current evidence suggests that both digital mammography and DBT are effective primary screening modalities.</p><h2>Supporting Evidence</h2><h3><strong>Scope of Review</strong></h3>\r\n<p>To update its 2016 recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a systematic review<sup>4,50</sup> on the comparative effectiveness of different mammography-based breast cancer screening strategies by age to start and stop screening, screening interval, modality, use of supplemental imaging, or personalization of screening for breast cancer on the incidence of and progression to advanced breast cancer, breast cancer morbidity, and breast cancer&ndash;specific or all-cause mortality. To be included in the review, studies needed to report on detection and stage distribution of screen-detected invasive breast cancer over more than 1 round of screening, to allow assessment for evidence of stage shift (as evidence of potential benefit). Studies that reported only performance characteristics of testing (eg, sensitivity and specificity) or only detection rates were not eligible for inclusion. The review also assessed the harms of different breast cancer screening strategies.<sup>4</sup> Evidence from the trials that established breast cancer screening effectiveness with mammography has not been updated, as there are no new studies that include a group that is not screened. Analyses from prior reviews of that evidence were considered foundational evidence for the current recommendation.</p>\r\n<p>In addition to the systematic evidence review, the USPSTF commissioned collaborative modeling studies from 6 CISNET (Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network) modeling teams to provide information about the benefits and harms of breast cancer screening strategies that vary by the ages to begin and end screening, screening modality, and screening interval.<sup>12</sup> In alignment with the USPSTF&rsquo;s commitment to improve health equity, the USPSTF also commissioned modeling studies from 4 CISNET teams that have developed race-specific breast cancer models for Black women, to provide information about the effectiveness and harms of these different screening strategies in Black women. The USPSTF commissions decision modeling to help inform how best to target or implement a clinical preventive service when empirical evidence supports provision of the service.<sup>51</sup> The modeling studies complement the evidence that the systematic review provides.</p>\r\n<p>Given the documented racial disparities in breast cancer outcomes, in addition to commissioning modeling studies specific to Black women, the evidence review included contextual questions on the drivers behind and approaches to address disparities in health outcomes related to breast cancer, particularly the higher mortality in Black women.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Benefits and Comparative Benefits of Early Detection and Treatment</strong></h3>\r\n<p>Randomized trials that began enrolling participants more than 30 to 40 years ago have established the effectiveness of screening mammography to reduce breast cancer mortality. A meta-analysis conducted in support of the 2016 USPSTF breast cancer screening recommendation found that screening mammography was associated with relative risk (RR) reductions in breast cancer mortality of 0.88 (95% CI, 0.73-1.00; 9 trials) for women aged 39 to 49 years, 0.86 (95% CI, 0.68-0.97; 7 trials) for women aged 50 to 59 years, 0.67 (95% CI, 0.54-0.83; 5 trials) for women aged 60 to 69 years, and 0.80 (95% CI, 0.51-1.28; 3 trials) for women aged 70 to 74 years,<sup>44</sup> and an updated analysis of 3 Swedish screening trials reported a 15% relative reduction in breast cancer mortality for women aged 40 to 74 years (RR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.73-0.98]).<sup>52</sup> Only 1 of these trials enrolled a significant proportion of Black women.<sup>53</sup> None of the trials nor the combined meta-analysis demonstrated a difference in all-cause mortality with screening mammography. The current USPSTF review focused on the comparative benefits of different screening strategies.</p>\r\n<h4>Age to Start or Stop Screening</h4>\r\n<p>The USPSTF did not identify any RCTs designed to test the comparative effectiveness of different ages to start or stop screening that reported morbidity, mortality, or quality-of-life outcomes. One trial emulation study (n = 1,058,013), using a random sample from Medicare claims data, estimated the effect of women stopping screening at age 70 years compared with those who continued annual screening after age 70 years. Based on survival analysis, this study reported that continued screening between the ages of 70 and 74 years was associated with a 22% decrease in the risk of breast cancer mortality, compared with a cessation of screening at age 70 years. While collaborative modeling estimated that, compared with a stopping age of 74, screening biennially starting at age 40 years until age 79 years would lead to 0.8 additional breast cancer deaths averted, the trial emulation study found that there was no difference in the hazard ratio or absolute rates of breast cancer mortality with continued screening vs discontinued screening from ages 75 to 79 years or ages 80 to 84 years.<sup>40</sup></p>\r\n<p>Collaborative modeling data estimated that compared with biennial screening from ages 50 to 74 years, biennial screening starting at age 40 years until 74 years would lead to 1.3 additional breast cancer deaths averted (median, 6.7 vs 8.2, respectively, across 6 models) per 1000 women screened over a lifetime of screening for all women (<a href=\"#tab2\">Table 2</a>; note that the 1.3 deaths averted is the median of the differences in each of 6 models, which is not the same as the difference of the medians noted above and in the table). Models also estimated that screening benefits for Black women are similar for breast cancer mortality reduction and greater for life-years gained and breast cancer deaths averted compared with all women. Thus, biennial screening starting at age 40 years would result in 1.8 additional breast cancer deaths averted (median, 9.2 deaths averted for screening from ages 50 to 74 vs 10.7 deaths averted, across 4 models) per 1000 women screened for Black women (<a href=\"#tab2\">Table 2</a>; note that the 1.8 deaths averted is the median of the differences in each of 4 models, which is not the same as the difference of the medians noted above and in the table).<sup>12</sup> Epidemiologic data has shown that the incidence rate of invasive breast cancer for 40- to 49-year-old women has increased an average of 2.0% annually between 2015 and 2019, a higher rate than in previous years.<sup>3</sup> These factors led the USPSTF to conclude that screening mammography in women aged 40 to 49 years has a moderate benefit by reducing the number of breast cancer deaths.</p>\r\n<h4>Screening Interval</h4>\r\n<p>The USPSTF did not identify any randomized trials directly comparing annual vs biennial screening that reported morbidity, mortality, or quality-of-life outcomes. One trial (n = 14,765) conducted in Finland during the years 1985 to 1995 assigned participants aged 40 to 49 years to annual or triennial screening invitations based on birth year (even birth year: annual; odd birth year: triennial) and reported similar mortality from incident breast cancer and for all-cause mortality between the 2 groups, with follow-up to age 52 years.<sup>54</sup></p>\r\n<p>A nonrandomized study using BCSC data (n = 15,440) compared the tumor characteristics of cancers detected following annual vs biennial screening intervals.<sup>14</sup> The relative risk of being diagnosed with a stage IIB or higher cancer and cancer with less favorable characteristics was not statistically different for biennially vs annually screened women in any of the age categories. The risk of a stage IIB or higher cancer diagnosis and of having a tumor with less favorable prognostic characteristics was higher for premenopausal women screened biennially vs annually (RR, 1.28 [95% CI, 1.01-1.63] and RR, 1.11 [95% CI, 1.00-1.22], respectively). However, this study did not conduct formal tests for interaction in the subgroup comparisons and did not adjust for multiple comparisons.</p>\r\n<p>One RCT (n = 76,022) conducted between 1989 and 1996 randomized individuals to annual or triennial screening and reported on breast cancer incidence. The number of screen-detected cancers was higher in the annual screening study group (RR, 1.64 [95% CI, 1.28-2.09]). However, the total number of cancers diagnosed either clinically or with screening was similar after 3 years of screening. Cancers occurring in the annual screening group (including clinically diagnosed cancers) did not differ by prognostic features such as tumor size, node positivity status, or histologic grade compared with those in the triennial screening group.<sup>55</sup></p>\r\n<p>Collaborative modeling estimated that biennial screening results in greater incremental life-years gained and mortality reduction per mammogram and has a more favorable balance of benefits to harms for all women and for Black women, compared with annual screening. While modeling suggests that screening Black women annually and screening other women biennially would reduce the disparity in breast cancer mortality,<sup>12,13</sup> trial or observational evidence is lacking that screening any group of women annually compared with biennial screening improves mortality from breast cancer.<sup>4</sup></p>\r\n<h4>DBT vs Digital Mammography</h4>\r\n<p>The USPSTF did not identify any RCTs or observational studies that compared screening with DBT vs digital mammography and reported morbidity, mortality, or quality-of-life outcomes.</p>\r\n<p>Three RCTs<sup>56-58</sup> and 1 nonrandomized study<sup>59</sup> compared detection of invasive cancer over 2 rounds of screening with DBT vs digital mammography. These trials screened all participants with the same screening modality at the second screening round&mdash;digital mammography in 2 trials and the nonrandomized study and DBT in 1 trial. Stage shift or differences in tumor characteristics across screening rounds could offer indirect evidence of potential screening benefit. The trials found no statistically significant difference in detection at the second screening round (pooled RR, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.73-1.05]; 3 trials [n = 105,064]).<sup>4,50</sup> The nonrandomized study (n = 92,404) found higher detection at round 1 for the group screened with DBT and higher detection at round 2 for the group screened with digital mammography at both rounds. There were no statistically significant differences in tumor diameter, histologic grade, and node status at the first or second round of screening in any of these studies.</p>\r\n<p>Collaborative modeling data estimated that the benefits of DBT are similar to the estimated benefits of digital mammography (eg, approximately 5 to 6 more life-years gained per 1000 women screened).<sup>12,13</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Supplemental Screening With MRI or Ultrasonography, or Personalized Screening</h4>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no studies of supplemental screening with MRI or ultrasonography, or studies of personalized (eg, risk-based) screening strategies, that reported on morbidity or mortality or on cancer detection and characteristics over multiple rounds of screening.<sup>4,50</sup> Collaborative modeling studies did not investigate the effects of screening with MRI or ultrasonography. Modeling generally estimated that the benefits of screening mammography would be greater for persons at modestly increased risk (eg, the risk of breast cancer associated with a first-degree family history of breast cancer).<sup>12,13</sup></p>\r\n<h3><strong>Harms of Screening</strong></h3>\r\n<p>For this recommendation, the USPSTF also reviewed the harms of screening for breast cancer and whether the harms varied by screening strategy. Potential harms of screening for breast cancer include false-positive and false-negative results, need for additional imaging and biopsy, overdiagnosis, and radiation exposure.</p>\r\n<p>The most common harm is a false-positive result, which can lead to psychological harms such as anxiety or breast cancer&ndash;specific worry,<sup>44</sup> as well as additional testing and invasive follow-up procedures without the potential for benefit. Collaborative modeling data estimated that a strategy of screening biennially from ages 40 to 74 years would result in 1376 false-positive results per 1000 women screened over a lifetime of screening (<a href=\"#tab2\">Table 2</a>).<sup>12,13</sup></p>\r\n<p>Overdiagnosis occurs when breast cancer that would never have become a threat to a person&rsquo;s health, or even apparent, during their lifetime is found due to screening. It is not possible to directly observe for any individual person whether they have or do not have an overdiagnosed tumor; it is only possible to indirectly estimate the frequency of overdiagnosis that may occur across a screened population. Estimates of the percentage of cancers diagnosed in a study that represent overdiagnosed cancers from RCTs that had comparable groups at baseline, had adequate follow-up, and did not provide screening to the control group at the end of the trial range from approximately 11% to 19%.<sup>4,50</sup> Collaborative modeling data estimate that a strategy of screening biennially from ages 40 to 74 years would lead to 14 overdiagnosed cases of breast cancer per 1000 persons screened over the lifetime of screening (<a href=\"#tab2\">Table 2</a>), although with a very wide range of estimates (4 to 37 cases) across models.<sup>12,13</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Age to Start or Stop Screening</h4>\r\n<p>One trial emulation (n = 1,058,013) compared discontinuation of mammography screening at age 70 years or older with continued annual screening beyond this age.40 Overall, the 8-year cumulative risk of a breast cancer diagnosis was higher for the continued annual screening strategy after age 70 years (5.5% overall; 5.3% in women aged 70-74 years; 5.8% in women aged 75-84 years) compared with the stop screening strategy (3.9% overall; same proportion for both age groups). Fewer cancers were diagnosed under the stop screening strategy (ages 70-84 years), resulting in a lower risk of undergoing follow-up and treatment. For women aged 75 to 84 years, additional diagnoses did not contribute to a difference in the risk of breast cancer mortality, likely due to competing causes of death, raising the possibility that the additionally diagnosed cancers represent overdiagnosis.</p>\r\n<p>Collaborative modeling data estimated that lowering the age to start screening to 40 years from 50 years would result in about a 60% increase in false-positive results, and 2 additional overdiagnosed cases of breast cancer (range, 0 to 4) per 1000 women over a lifetime of screening (<a href=\"#tab2\">Table 2</a>).<sup>12,13</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Screening Interval</h4>\r\n<p>Rates of interval cancers (cancer diagnosis occurring between screening) reported in screening studies reflect a combination of cancers that were missed during previous screening examinations (false-negative results) and incident cancers emerging between screening rounds. Evidence from studies comparing various intervals and reporting on the effect of screening interval on the rate of interval cancers is mixed. One RCT comparing annual vs triennial screening reported that the rate of interval cancers was significantly lower in the annual invitation group (1.84 cases per 1000 women initially screened) than in the triennial invitation group (2.70 cases per 1000 women initially screened) (RR, 0.68 [95% CI, 0.50-0.92]),<sup>55</sup> while a quasi-randomized study, also comparing annual vs triennial screening, found no difference in the number of interval cancers between the 2 groups.<sup>54</sup></p>\r\n<p>Based on 2 studies, false-positive results were more likely to occur with annual screening compared with longer intervals between screening.<sup>60,61</sup> One of these studies, using data from the BCSC, reported that biennial screening led to a 5% absolute decrease in the 10-year cumulative false-positive biopsy rate compared with annual screening, whether screening was conducted with DBT or digital mammography.<sup>60</sup> Collaborative modeling estimated that annual screening results in more false-positive results and breast cancer overdiagnosis. For example, a strategy of screening annually from ages 40 to 74 years would result in about 50% more false-positive results and 50% more overdiagnosed cases of breast cancer compared with biennial screening for all women and a similar increase in false-positive results and a somewhat smaller increase in overdiagnosed cases for Black women.<sup>12,13</sup></p>\r\n<h4>DBT vs Digital Mammography</h4>\r\n<p>Three RCTs did not show statistically significant differences in the risk of interval cancer following screening with DBT or digital mammography (pooled RR, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.64-1.17]; 3 trials [n = 130,196]).<sup>4,50</sup> Five nonrandomized studies generally support the RCT findings. Three of the nonrandomized studies found no significant difference in the rate of interval cancers diagnosed following screening with DBT or digital mammography,<sup>59,62,63</sup> while 1 study found a slight increased risk with DBT screening<sup>64</sup> and 1 study found an unadjusted decreased risk with DBT screening.<sup>65</sup></p>\r\n<p>A pooled analysis of 3 RCTs (n = 105,244) comparing screening with DBT vs digital mammography did not find a difference in false-positive results at the second round of screening.<sup>4,50</sup> A nonrandomized study using BCSC data reported that the estimated cumulative probability of having at least 1 false-positive result over 10 years of screening was generally lower with DBT screening compared with digital mammography screening (annual screening: 10-year cumulative probability of a false-positive result was 49.6% with DBT and 56.3% with digital mammography; biennial screening: 10-year cumulative probability of a false-positive result was 35.7% for DBT and 38.1% for digital mammography). The risk of having a biopsy over 10 years of screening was slightly lower when comparing annual screening with DBT vs digital mammography but did not differ between DBT and digital mammography for biennial screening (annual screening: 10-year cumulative probability of a false-positive biopsy was 11.2% with DBT and 11.7% with digital mammography; biennial screening: 10-year cumulative probability of a false-positive biopsy was 6.6% for DBT and 6.7% for digital mammography). When results were stratified by breast density, the difference in false-positive result probability with DBT vs digital mammography was largest for women with nondense breasts and was not significantly different among women with extremely dense breasts.<sup>60</sup> Collaborative modeling, using inputs from BCSC data, estimated that screening women aged 40 to 74 years with DBT would result in 167 fewer false-positive results (range, 166-169) per 1000 persons screened, compared with digital mammography.<sup>12,13</sup></p>\r\n<p>In the 3 RCTs cited above, rates of DCIS detected did not differ between persons screened with DBT and digital mammography.<sup>56-58</sup></p>\r\n<p>Screening with DBT includes evaluation of 2-dimensional images, generated either with digital mammography or using a DBT scan to produce a synthetic digital mammography image.<sup>9,10</sup> Studies using DBT with digital mammography screening reported radiation exposure approximately 2 times higher compared with the digital mammography&ndash;only control group.<sup>56,58,66</sup> Differences in radiation exposure were smaller in studies using DBT/synthetic digital mammography compared with digital mammography.<sup>67,68</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Supplemental Screening With Ultrasonography or MRI</h4>\r\n<p>The DENSE RCT, which compared invitation to screening with digital mammography plus MRI compared with digital mammography alone in participants aged 50 to 75 years with extremely dense breasts and a negative mammogram result, reported a significantly lower rate of invasive interval cancers&mdash;2.2 cases per 1000 women invited to screening with digital mammography plus MRI, compared with 4.7 cases per 1000 women invited to screening with digital mammography only (RR, 0.47 [95% CI, 0.29-0.77]).<sup>69</sup></p>\r\n<p>In that trial, the rate of recall among participants who underwent additional imaging with MRI was 94.9 per 1000 screens, the false-positive rate was 79.8 per 1000 women screened, and the rate of biopsy was 62.7 per 1000 women screened.<sup>70</sup> In a nonrandomized study using US insurance claims data, individuals who had an MRI compared with those receiving only a mammogram were more likely in the subsequent 6 months to have additional cascade events related to extramammary findings (adjusted difference between groups, 19.6 per 100 women screened [95% CI, 8.6-30.7]), mostly additional health care visits.<sup>71</sup></p>\r\n<p>In an RCT comparing screening with digital mammography plus ultrasonography vs digital mammography alone conducted in persons aged 40 to 49 years and not specifically among persons with dense breasts, the interval cancer rates reported were not statistically significantly different between the 2 groups (RR, 0.58 [95% CI, 0.31-1.08]);<sup>72</sup> similarly, in a nonrandomized study comparing digital mammography plus ultrasonography vs digital mammography alone using BCSC data, there was no difference in interval cancers (adjusted RR, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.33-1.37]),<sup>73</sup> although in both studies the confidence intervals were wide for this uncommon outcome. In the BCSC analysis, the rates of referral to biopsy and false-positive biopsy recommendations were twice as high and short interval follow-up was 3 times higher for the group screened with ultrasonography.<sup>73</sup></p>\r\n<h3><strong>Response to Public Comment</strong></h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from May 9, 2023, to June 6, 2023. The USPSTF received many comments on the draft recommendation and appreciates all the thoughtful views and perspectives that were shared. Many comments agreed with the draft recommendation. Several comments suggested that there should be no upper age limit for breast cancer screening or that an upper age should be based on life expectancy. In response, the USPSTF notes that no trials of breast cancer screening enrolled women 75 years or older and an emulated trial showed no benefit to screening women aged 75 to 79 or 80 to 84. Some comments suggested that breast cancer screening should start prior to age 40 years, either for all women or for women who are at increased risk of breast cancer. Relatedly, some comments expressed that risk-based screening should be recommended. In response, the USPSTF would like to reiterate that no trials of breast cancer screening enrolled women younger than 39 years. Additionally, the USPSTF found no evidence on the benefits or harms of individualized breast cancer screening based on risk factors. Several randomized trials of risk-based screening are underway (eg, the WISDOM trial) that may provide valuable information regarding this question.</p>\r\n<p>Several comments expressed that breast cancer screening should be recommended annually. In response, the USPSTF would like to reiterate that it did not identify any randomized trials directly comparing annual vs biennial screening. Two trials conducted in the 1980s to 1990s reported no difference in breast cancer mortality or breast cancer features such as tumor size, node positivity status, or histologic grade when comparing annual vs triennial screening. The USPSTF considers both the benefits and harms of different screening intervals and notes that the modeling studies commissioned to support this recommendation found that biennial screening results in greater life-years gained and mortality reduction per mammogram and has a more favorable balance of benefits to harms compared with annual screening.</p>\r\n<p>Many comments requested that the USPSTF recommend supplemental screening with MRI or ultrasound for women with dense breasts. Some comments expressed that this would improve health outcomes, while other comments requested this recommendation so that supplemental screening would be covered by insurance. In response, the USPSTF wants to restate that it found insufficient evidence on the effects of supplemental screening on health outcomes. No studies of supplemental screening reported on health outcomes or on the incidence of and progression to advanced breast cancer over more than 1 round of screening. The USPSTF wants all women to be able to get the care they need and would like to clarify that the I statement is not a recommendation for or against supplemental screening in women with dense breasts. It fundamentally means that there is insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms, or to recommend for or against supplemental screening, and that women should talk with their clinicians about what is best given their individual circumstances. The USPSTF is also calling for more research to help close this important evidence gap.</p>\r\n<p>Some comments requested clarification of the patient population included in this recommendation, particularly as it relates to women with a family history of breast cancer or those with a genetic predisposition to increased breast cancer risk. In response, the USPSTF clarified that this recommendation applies to women with a family history of breast cancer but not those who have a genetic marker or syndrome or chest radiation exposure at a young age associated with a high risk of breast cancer. The USPSTF also clarified that it has an existing recommendation on risk assessment, genetic counseling, and genetic testing for BRCA-related cancer.</p>\r\n<p>Some comments expressed that racial and ethnic disparities in breast cancer outcomes, especially in Black women, need to be comprehensively addressed. Related comments expressed that the higher breast cancer mortality that Black women experience is primarily related to their not receiving follow-up evaluation and treatment of the same timeliness and quality as White women, and that starting screening at age 40 years will not remedy this inequity. The USPSTF agrees that mitigating disparities in breast cancer mortality is crucial and highlights these disparities in the Disparities in Breast Cancer Outcomes and Implementation Considerations section of this recommendation statement. The USPSTF also agrees that improvements across the entire spectrum of breast cancer care are needed to reduce mortality for individuals experiencing disparities associated with lower breast cancer survival. For this recommendation, current evidence shows that screening for breast cancer starting at age 40 years will be of significant benefit to Black women. The USPSTF is also calling for more research to understand the underlying causes of why Black women are more likely to be diagnosed with breast cancers that have biomarker patterns that confer greater risk for poor health outcomes, to understand the causes of and ways to mitigate the higher mortality from breast cancer that Black women experience.</p>\r\n<p>Some comments disagreed with the USPSTF B recommendation for screening women between the ages of 40 and 49 years, questioned the evidence to support this, or expressed that the current recommendation downplays the harms of screening. In response, the USPSTF has clarified that it uses modeling to complement trial and observational evidence when there is empirical (ie, trial) evidence of the benefit of a preventive service on health outcomes, as there is for breast cancer screening. Decision modeling can assist the USPSTF in assessing the magnitude of the benefits and harms of different screening strategies. The USPSTF carefully weighs both the benefits and harms of a preventive service as it makes its recommendations and currently concludes, as it has in the past, that the benefits of breast cancer screening outweigh the harms for women between the ages of 40 and 49 years. The most recent epidemiologic data reviewed by the USPSTF show greater incidence of breast cancer at younger ages, and decision modeling shows a greater magnitude of benefit for screening women between the ages of 40 and 49 years. The USPSTF considered both these lines of evidence as it issued its current B recommendation for biennial screening mammography for women aged 40 to 74 years.</p>\r\n<p>Last, in response to comments, the USPSTF added the breast cancer screening recommendations from the American College of Radiology to the Recommendations of Others section.</p><h2>Research Needs and Gaps</h2><p>See <a href=\"#tab3\">Table 3</a> for research needs and gaps related to screening for breast cancer.</p><h2>Recommendations of Others</h2><p>The American Cancer Society recommends that women with an average risk of breast cancer should undergo regular screening mammography starting at age 45 years. It suggests that women aged 45 to 54 years should be screened annually, that women 55 years or older should transition to biennial screening or have the opportunity to continue screening annually, that women should have the opportunity to begin annual screening between the ages of 40 and 44 years, and that women should continue screening mammography as long as their overall health is good and they have a life expectancy of 10 years or longer.<sup>74</sup></p>\r\n<p>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that women at average risk of breast cancer should be offered screening mammography starting at age 40 years, using shared decision-making, and if they have not initiated screening in their 40s, they should begin screening mammography by no later than age 50 years. It recommends that women at average risk of breast cancer should have screening mammography every 1 or 2 years and should continue screening mammography until at least age 75 years. Beyond age 75 years, the decision to discontinue screening mammography should be based on shared decision-making informed by the woman&rsquo;s health status and longevity.<sup>75</sup></p>\r\n<p>The American College of Radiology and the Society of Breast Imaging recommend annual screening mammography beginning at age 40 years for women at average risk. They recommend that screening should continue past age 74 years, without an upper age limit, unless severe comorbidities limit life expectancy.<sup>76</sup> The American College of Radiology also recommends breast cancer risk assessment by age 25 years for all individuals.<sup>77</sup></p>\r\n<p>The American Academy of Family Physicians supports the 2016 USPSTF recommendation on screening for breast cancer.<sup>78</sup></p><h2>Table 2.

The USPSTF often needs additional evidence to create the strongest recommendations for everyone, especially those with the greatest burden of disease. In some cases, clinical preventive services have been well studied, but there are important evidence gaps that prevent the USPSTF from making recommendations for specific populations. In this table, the USPSTF summarizes the gaps in the evidence for screening for breast cancer and emphasizes health equity gaps that need to be addressed to advance the health of the nation. Although the health equity gaps focus on Black women because they have the poorest health outcomes from breast cancer, it is important to note that all studies should actively recruit enough women of all racial and ethnic groups, including Asian, Black, Hispanic, Native American/Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander participants, to investigate whether the effectiveness of screening, diagnosis, and treatment vary by group.

It does not apply to persons who are considering hormone therapy for the management of perimenopausal symptoms, such as hot flashes or vaginal dryness. It also does not apply to persons who have had premature menopause (primary ovarian insufficiency) or surgical menopause.</p>\r\n<p>The trials that provided evidence on the benefits and harms of menopausal hormone therapy for this recommendation generally used the term &ldquo;women&rdquo; to describe participants, although it is likely that these trials enrolled participants on the basis of sex, not gender identity.</p>\r\n<h3>Intervention</h3>\r\n<p>Menopausal hormone therapy refers to the use of combined estrogen and progestin in persons with an intact uterus, or estrogen alone in persons who have had a hysterectomy, taken at or after the time of menopause. For this recommendation, the USPSTF considered evidence on the benefits and harms of systemic (ie, oral or transdermal) menopausal hormone therapy but not local formulations of hormone therapy, because these are not generally used for the primary prevention of chronic conditions. Although some of the specific benefits and harms of estrogen plus progestin and estrogen alone differ, the USPSTF concludes that overall, both estrogen plus progestin and estrogen alone have no net benefit for the primary prevention of chronic conditions. It has also been hypothesized that the benefits and harms of menopausal hormone therapy might differ based on participants&rsquo; age or timing of initiation of therapy with respect to menopause; however, evidence supporting this is limited. See &ldquo;Effects on Outcomes by Age or Timing of Intervention&rdquo; in the Supporting Evidence section for more detail.</p>\r\n<p>Indications for hormone therapy approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in menopausal persons are limited to the treatment of menopausal symptoms and the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis.<sup>6</sup> Several different formulations of menopausal hormone therapy are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use in the US; the specific formulation used in the Women&rsquo;s Health Initiative (WHI), the largest trial reviewed by the USPSTF, was 0.625 mg/d of oral conjugated equine estrogen, with or without 2.5 mg/d of medroxyprogesterone acetate.<sup>7</sup> Currently, evidence to determine whether different types, doses, or modes of delivery of hormone therapy affect its benefit-to-harm profile for the prevention of chronic conditions is limited.<sup>8,9</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Other Related USPSTF Recommendations</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF has made several recommendations related to the prevention of cardiovascular disease and other chronic conditions in adults, including aspirin use for the prevention of cardiovascular disease,<sup>10</sup> screening for high blood pressure,<sup>11</sup> screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes,<sup>12</sup> behavioral counseling to promote a healthful diet and physical activity for cardiovascular disease prevention in adults (with and without cardiovascular risk factors),<sup>13,14</sup> and screening for osteoporosis.<sup>15</sup> The USPSTF has also made recommendations on screening for breast cancer<sup>16</sup> and screening for colorectal cancer.<sup>17</sup></p><h2>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h2><p>This recommendation replaces the 2017 USPSTF recommendation on hormone therapy for the primary prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal women. In 2017, the USPSTF recommended against the use of combined estrogen and progestin for the primary prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal women and against the use of estrogen alone for the primary prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal women who have had a hysterectomy.<sup>18</sup> This recommendation is consistent with the 2017 USPSTF recommendation.</p>","other":"<h2>Recommendations of Others</h2><p>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends against the use of menopausal hormone therapy for primary and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease.<sup>33</sup> It also notes that evidence suggests that women in early menopause who are in good cardiovascular health and at low risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes should be considered candidates for the use of estrogen therapy or conjugated equine estrogen plus a progestin for relief of menopausal symptoms and that menopausal hormone therapy is approved for use in women with an increased risk of osteoporosis and fracture.<sup>34</sup> The North American Menopause Society recommends that hormone therapy should not be prescribed for chronic disease prevention. It also notes that extended duration of hormone therapy use might be appropriate in symptomatic women or for the prevention of osteoporosis, if alternative therapies are not tolerated, based on a careful assessment of individual benefits and risks.<sup>35</sup> The American Academy of Family Physicians endorses the previous USPSTF recommendation on hormone therapy in postmenopausal persons.<sup>36</sup></p>","discussion":"<h2>Supporting Evidence</h2><h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n<p>To update its 2017 recommendation statement, the USPSTF commissioned a systematic review of the evidence on the benefits and harms of systemic (ie, oral or transdermal) hormone therapy for the prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal persons and whether outcomes vary by age or by timing of intervention after menopause.<sup>8,9</sup> The use of hormone therapy for the treatment of menopausal symptoms (eg, vasomotor hot flashes or vulvovaginal symptoms) or for other indications is outside the scope of this recommendation.</p>\r\n<h3>Benefits and Harms of Preventive Medication</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found 20 randomized clinical trials that compared the effects of estrogen, either alone or in combination with progestin, vs placebo for the prevention of chronic conditions.<sup>8,9</sup> Of these studies, the WHI trials were the only studies powered to assess the effectiveness of hormone therapy for the primary prevention of various chronic conditions. The WHI trials enrolled postmenopausal persons aged 50 to 79 years; the mean age of participants was 63 years. The WHI compared 0.625 mg/d of oral conjugated equine estrogen, with or without 2.5 mg/d of medroxyprogesterone acetate, with placebo. Evidence on other types, doses, or modes of delivery of hormone therapy was limited. The WHI also had the longest durations of follow-up, with a median intervention of 7.2 years for the estrogen-only trial and 5.6 years for the estrogen plus progestin trial, as well as long-term follow-up of up to 20.4 years.<sup>7,19</sup> The following discussion focuses on coronary heart disease outcomes, all-cause mortality, and outcomes for which the USPSTF assessed the evidence as adequate or convincing for benefit or harms. Other outcomes and more details are available in the accompanying systematic evidence review.<sup>8</sup></p>\r\n<h4><em>Coronary Heart Disease</em></h4>\r\n<p>Observational evidence has suggested that there might be a protective effect of menopausal hormone therapy on coronary heart disease; however, the WHI and other trials of menopausal hormone therapy have not demonstrated such an effect. A pooled analysis of 3 trials (n = 18,085) showed no significant difference in risk of coronary heart disease events in persons treated with estrogen plus progestin compared with placebo (2.8% vs 2.6%; relative risk [RR], 1.12 [95% CI, 0.94-1.33]) during a mean follow-up of 4 years. Similarly, a pooled analysis of 3 trials (n = 11,310) found no significant difference in coronary events between persons taking estrogen alone and those taking placebo (RR, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.79-1.14]) during a mean follow-up of 4.1 years.<sup>8,9</sup></p>\r\n<h4><em>Breast Cancer</em></h4>\r\n<p>Because estrogen generally stimulates breast cell proliferation, trials of menopausal hormone therapy have reported on the risk of breast cancer as one of the primary adverse outcomes of treatment.</p>\r\n<p>In the WHI (n = 16,608), persons randomized to estrogen plus progestin had a significantly increased risk of invasive breast cancer compared with those taking placebo (2.4% vs 1.9%; hazard ratio [HR], 1.24 [95% CI, 1.01-1.53]),<sup>7</sup> which persisted during postintervention follow-up.<sup>20</sup> Other trials either reported few cases of breast cancer or were generally consistent with the WHI findings in direction of effect. In the WHI, during 20.3 years of follow-up, the point estimate of the risk of breast cancer mortality was higher for persons in the estrogen plus progestin group than those in the placebo group, although the difference did not reach statistical significance (HR, 1.35 [95% CI, 0.94-1.95]).<sup>19</sup></p>\r\n<p>Four trials reported on the effects of estrogen alone on breast cancer; however, only the WHI followed participants for more than 3 years. At 20.7 years of follow-up, the WHI reported a lower risk of invasive breast cancer among persons assigned to estrogen alone compared with those assigned to placebo (HR, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.65-0.93]),<sup>20</sup> although the risk of breast cancer was not significantly lower during the study&rsquo;s 7.2-year intervention phase.<sup>7,21</sup> The other trials reported very few cases of breast cancer.<sup>8,9</sup> The WHI also reported on breast cancer mortality. At 20.7 years of follow-up, persons who received estrogen alone during the intervention phase had a lower risk of breast cancer mortality than those in the placebo group (HR, 0.60 [95% CI, 0.37-0.97]).<sup>19</sup></p>\r\n<h4><em>Fractures</em></h4>\r\n<p>Five trials reported on fracture risk in persons randomized to estrogen plus progestin compared with placebo. A pooled analysis of these trials (n = 20,499) found a statistically significant reduction of fractures in persons taking estrogen plus progestin (8.7% vs 10.9%; RR, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.66-0.94]).<sup>8,9</sup></p>\r\n<p>The WHI (n = 10,739) also found a lower risk of total fractures in persons taking estrogen alone compared with placebo during the intervention phase (1.53% annualized vs 2.14% annualized; HR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.64-0.80]),<sup>7</sup> which persisted during 4.3 years of postintervention follow-up.<sup>22</sup> A smaller trial found fewer fractures at all sites in the estrogen-alone group, although the difference was not statistically significant.<sup>23</sup></p>\r\n<h4><em>Diabetes</em></h4>\r\n<p>Two trials reported on the effects of menopausal hormone therapy on incident diabetes. In the WHI (n = 15,874), fewer persons randomized to estrogen plus progestin reported a new diagnosis of diabetes compared with those taking placebo (HR, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.70-0.94]).<sup>7,24</sup> A smaller trial also found a reduced risk of incident diabetes, although that was a post hoc analysis.<sup>25</sup></p>\r\n<p>In the WHI (n = 9917), fewer persons taking estrogen alone reported a new diagnosis of diabetes compared with those taking placebo (1.34% annualized vs 1.55% annualized; HR, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.76-0.98]).<sup>7</sup></p>\r\n<h4><em>Colorectal Cancer</em></h4>\r\n<p>Four trials reported on the incidence of colorectal cancer in persons randomized to estrogen plus progestin therapy. In the WHI estrogen plus progestin trial (n = 16,608), persons randomized to estrogen plus progestin had a lower risk of colorectal cancer than those in the placebo group (0.59% vs 0.93%; HR, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.43-0.89]) over a median follow-up of 5.6 years.<sup>7</sup> The other trials either reported few cases of colorectal cancer or were generally consistent with the WHI findings in direction of effect.<sup>8,9</sup></p>\r\n<p>The WHI estrogen-alone trial (n = 10,739) reported no significant difference in the risk of colorectal cancer between persons randomized to estrogen alone and those taking placebo (1.2% vs 1.1%; HR, 1.15 [95% CI, 0.81-1.64]) during 7.2 years.<sup>7</sup></p>\r\n<h4><em>Thromboembolic Events</em></h4>\r\n<p>Five trials reported on risk of thromboembolism. In the WHI (n = 16,608), persons randomized to estrogen plus progestin had an increased risk of venous thrombosis (1.96% vs 0.94%; HR, 2.06 [95% CI, 1.57-2.70]), deep vein thrombosis (1.4% vs 0.8%; HR, 1.87 [95% CI, 1.37-2.54]), and pulmonary embolism (1.0% vs 0.5%; HR, 1.98 [95% CI, 1.36-2.87]) compared with those in the placebo group.<sup>7,26</sup> Other trials either reported few thromboembolic events or were consistent with the WHI findings.<sup>8,9</sup></p>\r\n<p>In the WHI (n = 10,739), persons randomized to estrogen alone had an increased risk of deep vein thrombosis (1.6% vs 1.0%; HR, 1.48 [95% CI, 1.06-2.07]); the risk of pulmonary embolism was higher in the estrogen group than in the placebo group, but results were not statistically significant, although the confidence interval was wide (0.98% vs 0.72%; HR, 1.35 [95% CI, 0.89-2.05]).<sup>7</sup></p>\r\n<h4><em>Stroke</em></h4>\r\n<p>The WHI found an increased risk of stroke with both estrogen plus progestin and estrogen-alone therapy. Stroke risk was significantly higher in persons randomized to estrogen plus progestin compared with those randomized to placebo (1.9% vs 1.3%; HR, 1.37 [95% CI, 1.07-1.76]).<sup>7</sup> Similarly, persons receiving estrogen alone had a statistically significant higher risk of stroke compared with those receiving placebo (3.2% vs 2.4%; HR, 1.35 [95% CI, 1.07-1.70]).<sup>7</sup> A smaller trial reported that stroke risk was similar in estrogen plus progestin and placebo groups, although the confidence interval was quite wide.<sup>27</sup></p>\r\n<h4><em>Dementia</em></h4>\r\n<p>The Women&rsquo;s Health Initiative Memory Study was a substudy of the WHI, evaluating the risk of dementia in persons randomized to estrogen plus progestin or estrogen alone compared with placebo. That study found that persons randomized to estrogen plus progestin (n = 4523) had a higher risk of probable dementia than those taking placebo (1.8% vs 0.9%; HR, 2.05 [95% CI, 1.21-3.48]).<sup>28</sup> No significant increase in risk of probable dementia was found in persons taking estrogen alone (n = 2947).<sup>29</sup></p>\r\n<h4><em>Gallbladder Disease</em></h4>\r\n<p>Two trials reported on the risk of gallbladder disease in persons taking menopausal hormone therapy. The WHI (n = 14,203) reported a significantly higher risk of gallbladder disease in persons randomized to estrogen plus progestin treatment compared with those randomized to placebo (1.31% annualized vs 0.84% annualized; HR, 1.57 [95% CI, 1.36-1.80]) and in persons randomized to estrogen alone (n = 8376; 1.64% annualized vs 1.06% annualized; HR, 1.55 [95% CI, 1.34-1.79]).<sup>7</sup> A smaller trial reported few cases of gallbladder disease.<sup>30</sup></p>\r\n<h4><em>Urinary Incontinence</em></h4>\r\n<p>Two trials reported on incident urinary incontinence (self-reported) in persons taking estrogen plus progestin; both found increased risk. In the WHI (n = 10,073), 16.6% (annualized) of persons taking estrogen plus progestin reported incident incontinence after 1 year of treatment, compared with 11.1% (annualized) of those taking placebo (HR, 1.49 [95% CI, 1.36-1.63]).<sup>7</sup> A smaller trial also reported increased risk.<sup>31</sup> Similarly, in persons randomized to estrogen alone, the WHI found a higher risk of urinary incontinence at 1 year (22.6% annualized vs 14.0% annualized; HR, 1.61 [95% CI, 1.46-1.79]) and 6.6 years after stopping treatment (28.6% vs 23.1%; HR, 1.24 [95% CI, 1.13-1.35]).<sup>7</sup></p>\r\n<h4><em>All-Cause Mortality</em></h4>\r\n<p>A pooled analysis of 3 trials (n = 19,580) showed no significant difference in all-cause mortality between persons taking estrogen and progestin therapy and those taking placebo (RR, 1.01 [95% CI, 0.88-1.16]) during 3.2 to 5.6 years of follow-up. Similarly, a pooled analysis of 3 trials (n = 11,587) showed no significant difference in all-cause mortality between persons receiving estrogen alone and those receiving placebo (RR, 1.04 [95% CI, 0.89-1.21]) during a mean follow-up of 7.1 years.<sup>8,9</sup></p>\r\n<h4><em>Effects on Outcomes by Age or Timing of Intervention</em></h4>\r\n<p>It has been hypothesized that the benefits and harms of menopausal hormone therapy might differ based on participants&rsquo; age or timing of initiation of therapy with respect to menopause. Accordingly, the WHI trials reported on outcomes stratified by decade of age and by time since menopause. Of note, the analyses of outcomes by time since menopause were post hoc. For most outcomes, there were no differences based on these parameters.<sup>7</sup> The WHI reported no statistically significant differences in risk of coronary heart disease based on age or time since menopause.<sup>7</sup> One analysis of the WHI estrogen plus progestin trial reported a statistically significant trend for risk of myocardial infarction (a secondary trial outcome) by time since menopause, with significantly higher risk in persons 20 or more years after menopause,<sup>7</sup> while a second analysis found no difference in coronary risk between early (&lt;5 years) vs late (&ge;5 years) initiation of hormone therapy with respect to menopause.<sup>32</sup></p>\r\n<p>The WHI estrogen-alone trial reported statistically significant trends by decade of age for the outcomes of myocardial infarction, colorectal cancer, and all-cause mortality, with lower risk in younger persons and higher risk in older persons, although the confidence intervals in all age groups included the null, with the exception of colorectal cancer, for which risk was significantly increased in 70- to 79-year-old persons.<sup>7</sup> Importantly, these findings are all limited by the multiplicity of outcomes and subgroup comparisons conducted (in these analyses, <em>P</em> values were not adjusted for the large number of tests conducted), the relatively small number of events that occurred for several of these outcomes, and the post hoc nature of the time since menopause analyses. Other studies have reported on the effect of timing on the benefits and harms of menopausal hormone therapy, but they are limited by study quality or other issues as well.<sup>8,9</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from April 19 to May 16, 2022. Some comments expressed that the benefits and harms of hormone therapy in postmenopausal persons might differ by the age of trial participants or by time since menopause. The USPSTF review of this evidence and its limitations is clarified in the Practice Considerations section and described further in the &ldquo;Effects on Outcomes by Age or Timing of Intervention&rdquo; subsection; the mean age of WHI participants is also provided in the Supporting Evidence section. In response to comments that the benefits and harms of hormone therapy differ by whether estrogen plus progestin or estrogen alone is used, or might differ by the formulation of hormone therapy used (eg, estradiol or progesterone vs conjugated equine estrogen or medroxyprogesterone acetate), the USPSTF has clarified language in the Practice Considerations section that although specific benefits and harms for estrogen plus progestin and estrogen alone differ, the USPSTF concludes that overall, both estrogen plus progestin and estrogen alone have no net benefit for the primary prevention of chronic conditions. Also, as noted in the Practice Considerations and Discussion sections of this recommendation, evidence on other types, doses, or modes of delivery of hormone therapy is limited.</p>\r\n<p>Some comments noted that hormone therapy is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the prevention of osteoporosis and reduces fractures in postmenopausal persons. The USPSTF acknowledges this indication in the Practice Considerations section of this recommendation. Evidence reviewed by the USPSTF showed that hormone therapy was associated with decreased risk of fracture; however, given the overall benefits and harms of hormone therapy, the USPSTF concluded that there is no net benefit at the population level. The USPSTF reviewed additional studies related to the WHI that reported on outcomes such as atrial fibrillation and peripheral arterial disease; these did not affect the overall assessment of the benefits and harms of hormone therapy.</p><h2>Research Needs and Gaps</h2><p>More research is needed that addresses the following.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Whether age or the timing of initiation of hormone therapy with respect to menopause affects health outcomes.</li>\r\n<li>Whether the benefits and harms of menopausal hormone therapy might vary across population groups. Because persons who experience systemic racism, poverty, or other socioeconomic barriers can be at higher risk for certain chronic conditions (eg, type 2 diabetes or stroke), it would be important to understand whether hormone therapy might have a different magnitude (or balance) of harms or benefits across racial and ethnic groups.

It does not apply to adults with symptoms of tuberculosis or to children and adolescents.</p>\r\n<h3>Definitions</h3>\r\n<p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),<sup>12</sup> <em>latent tuberculosis infection</em> or<em> LTBI</em> is an infection with <em>M tuberculosis</em> in which the bacteria are alive but contained by the immune system. Persons with LTBI have no apparent symptoms, do not feel sick, cannot spread tuberculosis to others, and usually have a positive tuberculosis skin test result or positive tuberculosis blood test reaction. Persons with LTBI may develop tuberculosis disease if they do not receive treatment for LTBI. <em>Active tuberculosis</em> or <em>tuberculosis disease</em> is an illness in which tuberculosis bacteria are multiplying and attacking a part of the body, usually the lungs. Tuberculosis disease may be symptomatic (including weakness, weight loss, fever, no appetite, chills, sweating at night, bad cough, pain in the chest, or coughing up blood). A person with tuberculosis disease may be infectious and spread tuberculosis bacteria to others.</p>\r\n<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>\r\n<p>Populations at increased risk for LTBI based on increased prevalence of active disease and increased risk of exposure include persons who were born in, or are former residents of, countries with high tuberculosis prevalence and persons who live in, or have lived in, high-risk congregate settings (eg, homeless shelters or correctional facilities). Clinicians can consult their local or state health departments for more information about populations at increased risk in their community, since local demographic patterns may vary across the US.</p>\r\n<p>In 2020, 71.5% of all cases of active tuberculosis in the US occurred among persons born outside the US.<sup>13</sup> According to the CDC, tuberculosis disease is common in most countries in Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and Russia.<sup>14</sup> In 2020, among persons with new tuberculosis living in the US who were born outside the US, the most common countries of birth were Mexico (18.0%), the Philippines (12.5%), India (10.4%), Vietnam (8.2%), and China (5.1%), accounting for 54.2% of total cases.<sup>15</sup> Most of these cases are believed to be due to progression of latent infection to active tuberculosis disease rather than new transmission within communities.<sup>16-21</sup></p>\r\n<p>Persons who live, or have lived, in high-risk congregate settings also have a higher prevalence rate of active tuberculosis and an increased risk for exposure. In 2020, 4.3% of tuberculosis disease cases diagnosed in persons 15 years or older occurred in persons experiencing homelessness and 2.6% occurred in residents of correctional facilities.<sup>22</sup> It is estimated that persons experiencing homelessness have an 11 times higher incidence of tuberculosis disease compared with persons who are not experiencing homelessness (36 cases per 100,000 population vs 2.9 cases per 100,000 population, respectively, during 2011 to 2016).<sup>23</sup></p>\r\n<p>Other populations at increased risk for LTBI or progression to active disease include persons who have immunosuppression (eg, persons living with HIV, patients receiving immunosuppressive medications such as chemotherapy or tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, and patients who have received an organ transplant) and patients with silicosis (a lung disease).<sup>9</sup> However, given that screening in these populations may be considered standard care as part of disease management or indicated prior to the use of certain medications, the USPSTF did not review evidence on screening in these populations. Information on testing in these populations is provided by other groups, such as the Office of AIDS Research at the National Institutes of Health,<sup>24</sup> and in a guideline issued jointly by the American Thoracic Society, Infectious Diseases Society of America, and CDC.<sup>25</sup> Some evidence from observational studies has explored the association between poorly controlled diabetes and progression of LTBI to active disease. However, there is insufficient evidence on screening for and treatment of LTBI in persons with diabetes for the USPSTF to make a separate recommendation for this important population.<sup>9,26</sup></p>\r\n<p>Persons who are contacts of individuals with active tuberculosis, health care workers, and workers in high-risk congregate settings may also be at increased risk of exposure. Because screening in these populations is conducted as part of public health or employee health surveillance, the USPSTF did not review the evidence in these populations. Clinicians seeking further information about testing for tuberculosis in these populations can refer to the Additional Tools and Resources and Recommendations of Others sections.</p>\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>Two types of screening tests for LTBI are currently available in the US: the tuberculin skin test (TST) and the interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA). The TST requires trained personnel to administer intradermal purified protein derivative and interpret the response 48 to 72 hours later.<sup>25,27</sup> The IGRA requires a single venous blood sample that measures the CD4 T-cell response to specific <em>M tuberculosis</em> antigens and laboratory processing within 8 to 30 hours after collection. Three types of IGRA are currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration: T-SPOT.<em>TB</em> (Oxford Immunotec Global), QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (Qiagen), and QuantiFERON-Gold Plus (Qiagen).<sup>9,28</sup></p>\r\n<p>Diagnosis of LTBI is based on further clinical assessment of positive screening results and ruling out active tuberculosis. Consistent with CDC guidelines, tuberculosis disease is diagnosed by medical history, physical examination, chest radiograph, and other laboratory tests. These additional examinations, diagnostics, and tests are essential to completing a diagnosis of LTBI.</p>\r\n<h3>Screening Intervals</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no evidence on the optimal frequency of screening for LTBI. In the absence of evidence, a reasonable approach is to repeat screening based on specific risk factors; screening frequency could range from 1-time only screening among persons at low risk for future tuberculosis exposure to annual screening among those at continued risk of exposure.</p>\r\n<h3>Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>Several antibiotics are available for the treatment of LTBI. Isoniazid was the first medication shown to prevent progression to active tuberculosis; however, concerns about hepatotoxicity and drug resistance resulting from low adherence with long courses of treatment have prompted recommendations of shorter courses and that it be used in combination with other medications such as rifapentine and rifampin. Current recommendations for the treatment of LTBI are available from the CDC.<sup>29</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Implementation</h3>\r\n<p>Screening with the TST requires that patients return 48 to 72 hours after administration of the skin test for interpretation of results. When placing a TST, clinicians should plan with patients accordingly to ensure they can return in time and that the facility is able to interpret the test results within the proper time frame.</p>\r\n<p>Screening with an IGRA requires obtaining a single venous blood sample, and patients do not need to return for interpretation of results. However, clinicians should be aware of processing requirements for blood samples and ensure that venous blood samples are drawn and can reach the laboratory for processing within the appropriate time frame (8 to 30 hours, depending on the test). Consistent with CDC guidelines, testing with IGRA may have advantages over TST for persons who have received a BCG vaccination, because IGRA does not cross-react with the vaccine, and also for persons who may be unlikely to return for TST interpretation.<sup>25</sup></p>\r\n<p>With the exception of twice-weekly isoniazid monotherapy, CDC-recommended regimens can be self-administered, including once-weekly combination therapy with isoniazid and rifapentine taken for 3 months.<sup>30</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Additional Tools and Resources</h3>\r\n<p>The CDC offers expert medical consultation to US clinicians with questions about patients being evaluated for tuberculosis or LTBI (<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/tb/education/tb_coe/default.htm\">https://www.cdc.gov/tb/education/tb_coe/default.htm</a>).

In 2016, the USPSTF recommended screening for LTBI in populations at increased risk (B recommendation).<sup>31</sup> The current recommendation is consistent with the 2016 USPSTF recommendation.</p>","other":"<h2>Supporting Evidence</h2><h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF commissioned a systematic evidence review<sup>9,28</sup> to update its 2016 recommendation on screening for LTBI. The review focused on the benefits and harms of LTBI screening and treatment in asymptomatic adults seen in primary care, as well as the accuracy of LTBI screening tests. It did not include evidence on screening in persons for whom LTBI screening would be considered management of a specific condition (eg, persons living with HIV), public health surveillance (ie, tracing contacts of persons with active tuberculosis disease), surveillance of employees working in high-risk settings, or screening indicated prior to the use of specific immunosuppressive medications.</p>\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>There is no direct test for the diagnosis of latent infection with <em>M tuberculosis</em>. In the absence of a reference standard for detection of LTBI, screening test performance is based on detection of disease in persons with known active tuberculosis and nondetection of disease in populations at low risk for the disease and presumed not to have LTBI or active tuberculosis.</p>\r\n<p>Currently available TST and IGRA screening tests are moderately sensitive and highly specific for LTBI.<sup>9,28</sup> The sensitivity and specificity of TST depends on the threshold used to determine positivity. Using a threshold of 5-mm induration, the pooled sensitivity of TST was 80% (12 studies; n = 1323) and the pooled specificity was 95% (3 studies; n = 5149).<sup>9,28</sup> Using a threshold of 10-mm induration, the pooled sensitivity was 81% (15 studies; n = 1427) and the pooled specificity was 98% (8 studies; n = 9604).<sup>9,28</sup> Last, using a threshold of 15-mm induration, the pooled sensitivity was 60% (9 studies; n = 1004) and the pooled specificity was 99% (10 studies; n = 9563).<sup>9,28</sup></p>\r\n<p>For IGRA tests, pooled sensitivity of the T-SPOT.<em>TB</em> test was 90% (37 studies; n = 5367) and pooled specificity ranged from 95% to 97% (2 studies; n = 1664).<sup>9,28</sup> For QFT-GIT, pooled sensitivity was 81% (48 studies; n = 7055) and pooled specificity was 99% (3 studies; n = 2090).<sup>9,28</sup> For QFT-Gold Plus, pooled sensitivity was 89% (11 studies; n = 939) and specificity was 98%, based on a single study (n = 211).<sup>9,28</sup> No eligible studies reported on the accuracy of sequential testing (TST followed by IGRA or IGRA followed by TST).</p>\r\n<p>Additional studies reporting on the reliability of TST and IGRA screening tests suggest moderate to substantial agreement between 2 observers.<sup>9</sup> Interrater reliability was higher for IGRA and varied by whether results were read manually or by automation.<sup>9</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF identified no randomized clinical trials that directly compared the benefits on health outcomes of LTBI-screened populations compared with unscreened populations. The International Union Against Tuberculosis (IUAT) trial,<sup>32</sup> a randomized clinical trial of LTBI treatment published in 1982, compared isoniazid with placebo in 27,830 European adults with fibrotic pulmonary lesions (but not active tuberculosis). Treatment with isoniazid (300 mg daily for 24 weeks) was associated with a decreased risk of developing active tuberculosis (relative risk [RR], 0.35 [95% CI, 0.24-0.52]), which translates to a number needed to treat of 112. The IUAT trial also suggested a potential reduction of risk of death from tuberculosis at 5 years with isoniazid treatment (RR, 0.14 [95% CI, 0.01-2.78]).</p>\r\n<p>More recent comparative effectiveness trials have compared other treatment regimens with isoniazid alone to establish the noninferiority of other regimens in asymptomatic persons with positive TST or IGRA results.<sup>9</sup> Two clinical trials compared treatment of LTBI with rifampin vs isoniazid (n = 6910)<sup>9,28,33,34</sup>: 8 vs 9 participants developed active tuberculosis in the rifampin group vs isoniazid group, and there were 22 deaths (all-cause mortality) in the rifampin group compared with 15 deaths in the isoniazid group. Two clinical trials (n = 7149) have compared treatment of LTBI with rifapentine plus isoniazid vs isoniazid alone<sup>9,28,35,36</sup>: 30 vs 34 deaths (all-cause mortality) in rifapentine plus isoniazid vs isoniazid-alone groups were reported across both studies, and 1 trial (n = 6886)<sup>35</sup> reported 5 vs 10 cases of subsequent active tuberculosis in the rifapentine plus isoniazid group vs isoniazid-alone group. None of the treatment studies reported on transmission rates of tuberculosis.</p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Screening and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF identified no studies that directly reported on the harms of screening. Potential hypothesized harms of screening include stigma associated with screening and diagnostic workup, as well as treatment of false-positive results. The IUAT trial reported on harms of treatment of LTBI with isoniazid compared with placebo.<sup>32,37</sup> An increased risk of hepatoxicity with isoniazid (300 mg for 24 weeks of treatment) was reported in the IUAT trial (RR, 4.59 [95% CI, 2.03-10.39]), translating to a number needed to harm of 279. Deaths due to hepatoxicity were rare; increased risk of death from hepatotoxicity was reported with an RR of 2.35 (95% CI, 0.12-45.46), translating to a number needed to harm of 6947. There was also a greater risk of treatment discontinuation because of adverse events reported with isoniazid (RR, 1.50 [95% CI, 1.18-1.89]) and a greater risk of gastrointestinal adverse events (RR, 1.33 [95% CI, 1.01-1.75]).</p>\r\n<p>More recent trials have evaluated whether other treatment regimens, including lower doses or shorter durations of isoniazid in combination with other medications, may be associated with lower risk of hepatotoxicity. Meta-analysis of 3 trials (n = 7339) that compared isoniazid vs rifampin found a higher pooled RR of hepatotoxicity with isoniazid (pooled RR, 4.22 [95% CI, 2.21-8.06]);<sup>9,28,33,34,38,39</sup> deaths from hepatotoxicity were not reported in any treatment groups. Two trials reported on harms of rifapentine plus isoniazid vs isoniazid alone.<sup>9,28,35,36,40</sup> The PREVENT TB study (n = 7731)<sup>35</sup> reported a statistically nonsignificant difference in grade 3 or 4 hepatotoxicity between participants receiving rifapentine plus isoniazid and those taking isoniazid alone (RR, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.75-1.08]); post hoc analyses showed a smaller number of cases of hepatotoxicity attributable to the study drug in the rifapentine plus isoniazid group compared with the isoniazid-alone group (RR, 0.16 [95% CI, 0.10-0.28]).<sup>40</sup> The second trial (n = 263)<sup>36</sup> reported a statistically nonsignificant decreased risk of clinically relevant hepatoxicity in the rifapentine plus isoniazid group compared with the isoniazid-alone group (RR, 0.28 [95% CI, 0.06-1.34]); no deaths due to hepatoxicity were reported in either treatment group.</p>\r\n<p>Recent trials also reported on discontinuation due to adverse events. There was a statistically nonsignificant increase in discontinuation due to adverse events in a meta-analysis of 3 trials of isoniazid vs rifampin (pooled RR, 2.25 [95% CI, 0.90-5.59]; 3 trials; n = 7339). Both the PREVENT TB study and a second trial of participants receiving rifapentine plus isoniazid vs isoniazid alone reported increased discontinuation due to adverse events in study participants in the rifapentine plus isoniazid group compared with isoniazid alone; however, this was statistically significant in only 1 trial.<sup>9,28</sup> Overall, study reports of gastrointestinal adverse events other than hepatotoxicity were heterogeneous, with mixed results.<sup>9,28</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from November 22, 2022, to December 27, 2022. Most commenters agreed with the conclusions of the USPSTF. Several commenters requested that the USPSTF highlight that TST and IGRA screening tests should not be used to screen for active tuberculosis and that in certain scenarios, IGRA may have advantages over TST. In response, the USPSTF added information to make clear that clinical assessment, physical examination, and diagnostic workup are necessary for the diagnosis of LTBI. The USPSTF also clarified scenarios in which IGRA could be preferable to TST. Other commenters sought additional information on persons at increased risk for LTBI or requested that the USPSTF identify additional populations at increased risk for LTBI in the recommendation. The USPSTF outlined evidence of persons at increased risk in the Assessment of Risk section of the recommendation. Given regional variations in the local populations considered at increased risk for tuberculosis, clinicians may consult their local or state public health agency for additional details on specific populations at increased risk in their community. Last, the USPSTF added clarifications to the Practice Considerations section and materials to the Additional Tools and Resources section to assist and guide clinicians in screening for and treatment of LTBI, as well as the need for community partnerships to prevent and eliminate LTBI and tuberculosis.</p><h2>Research Needs and Gaps</h2><p>More research is needed on the following.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Although risk factors for active tuberculosis disease are well described, studies are needed on the accuracy of risk assessment tools to help clinicians identify who is at increased risk for LTBI and who should receive screening.</li>\r\n<li>Evidence is needed to inform which populations should receive repeat screening for LTBI and how frequently.</li>\r\n<li>More research is needed to inform which screening strategies are more effective for specific patient populations.</li>\r\n</ul><h2>Recommendations of Others</h2><p>The CDC, together with the American Thoracic Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America, recommends screening for LTBI to identify persons who may benefit from treatment before progression to active tuberculosis infection.<sup>25,41</sup> Joint guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend screening for latent tuberculosis in early pregnancy for women at high risk for tuberculosis, including those with recent tuberculosis exposure, HIV infection, risk factors increasing risk of progression to active disease (such as diabetes, lupus, cancer, alcoholism, and drug addiction), use of immune-suppressing drugs such as tumor necrosis factor inhibitors or chronic steroids, kidney failure with dialysis, homelessness, living or working in long-term care facilities such as nursing homes and prisons, being medically underserved, and being born in a country with high prevalence of tuberculosis.<sup>42</sup> The American Academy of Family Physicians supports the 2016 USPSTF recommendation on screening for LTBI.<sup>43</sup></p>","topic":"Latent Tuberculosis Infection in Adults: Screening","keywords":"Tuberculosis|TB|LTBI","pubDate":"2023-05-02","categories":["11"],"tool":["463","474","473","472","471","470","469","468","467","466","465","464"]},"757":{"topicType":"Screening and Counseling and Preventive medication","topicYear":2023,"uspstfAlias":"oral-health-adults-screening-preventive-interventions","specific":[2026,2027],"title":"Oral Health in Adults: Screening and Preventive Interventions","rationale":"<h2>Importance</h2><p>Oral health is fundamental to health and well-being across the life span.<sup>1,2</sup> Dental caries (cavities) and periodontal disease (gum disease) are common and often untreated oral health conditions that affect eating, speaking, learning, smiling, and employment potential.<sup>1-4</sup> In the US, oral health disparities are shaped by inequities in the affordability and accessibility of dental care and other disadvantages related to social determinants of health (eg, living in an underserved rural area).<sup>1,2,4</sup> Dental caries and periodontitis disproportionately affect persons living in poverty; Asian, Black, Hispanic/Latino, Native American/Alaska Native, adults; adults with disabilities; adults 65 years or older or living in institutional settings; adults living in rural and urban underserved areas; adults without insurance or with public insurance; and adults experiencing homelessness.<sup>1,2</sup> Untreated oral health conditions can lead to tooth loss, irreversible tooth damage, and other serious adverse health outcomes.<sup>1,5</sup></p><h2>USPSTF Assessment of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h2><p>Due to a lack of evidence, the USPSTF concludes that the current <strong>evidence is insufficient</strong> to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for oral health conditions (eg, dental caries or periodontal disease) performed by primary care clinicians in asymptomatic adults.</p>\r\n<p>Due to a lack of evidence, the USPSTF concludes that the current <strong>evidence is insufficient</strong> to assess the balance of benefits and harms of preventive interventions for oral health conditions (eg, dental caries or periodontal disease) performed by primary care clinicians in asymptomatic adults.</p>\r\n<p>See <a href=\"#tab1\">Table 1</a> for more information on the USPSTF recommendation rationale and assessment.

more than 90% of US adults are affected by dental caries, and an estimated 26% have untreated dental caries.<sup>1,2</sup> Untreated dental caries can lead to serious infections and tooth loss.<sup>1,8</sup> An estimated 42% of US adults older than 30 years have periodontal disease, increasing to nearly 60% at age 65 years or older.<sup>1,11</sup> Untreated periodontitis can contribute to destruction of tissues that support the teeth and is the leading cause of tooth loss in older adults.<sup>1,9,12,13</sup></p>\r\n<p>Older adults are more likely to have medical conditions or use medications causing xerostomia (dry mouth), which contributes to oral health conditions.<sup>1,14</sup> Frequent intake of dietary sugars in foods and beverages, suboptimal fluoride exposure, oral hygiene practices (eg, lack of toothbrushing and flossing), tobacco use, unhealthy alcohol use, and methamphetamine use increase the risk of oral health conditions.<sup>1</sup> According to 2009-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data, people who smoke have a higher incidence of periodontal disease (62%) compared with adults 30 years or older overall (42%).<sup>1,11</sup></p>\r\n<p>Social determinants of health (nonbiological factors) associated with increased risk of oral health conditions include low socioeconomic status, lack of dental insurance, and living in communities with dental professional shortages, affecting access to dental care.<sup>1</sup> For older adults, physical limitations and loss of dental coverage upon retirement can increase barriers to dental care.<sup>5</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Potential Harms</h4>\r\n<p>Potential screening approaches in primary care (eg, oral clinical assessments or standardized risk assessment instruments) to identify persons with early untreated dental caries or periodontal disease or persons at increased future risk are noninvasive and would seem unlikely to cause serious harms, but evidence is lacking. Health education and counseling to encourage routine oral hygiene and reduce modifiable risk factors (eg, frequent intake of refined sugars or tobacco use) are also noninvasive.</p>\r\n<h4>Current Practice</h4>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found little evidence on current practices in primary care for routine screening or performing interventions to prevent dental caries or periodontitis in adults. In its review of the evidence, the USPSTF found that preventive interventions are generally performed in dental settings by dental professionals. There are well-known significant barriers to providing oral health services in the primary care setting, including variable clinician access and familiarity with interventions.<sup>1</sup> Primary care clinicians may need additional training and specific equipment to deliver screening and preventive interventions, have reimbursement challenges, and encounter administrative obstacles to making dental referrals and linking patients to dental care.<sup>1</sup> The USPSTF recommends oral fluoride supplements starting at age 6 months for children younger than 5 years with water sources deficient in fluoride and administration of varnish to the primary teeth of all children younger than 5 years after tooth eruption.<sup>15</sup> It is unknown how frequently fluoride is administered in older children and adults.</p>\r\n<h3>Additional Tools and Resources</h3>\r\n<p>The Health Resources and Services Administration&rsquo;s oral health factsheet (<a href=\"https://www.hrsa.gov/sites/default/files/hrsa/oral-health/oral-health-2016-factsheet.pdf\">https://www.hrsa.gov/sites/default/files/hrsa/oral-health/oral-health-2016-factsheet.pdf</a>) and report on <em>Integration of Oral Health and Primary Care Practice</em> (<a href=\"https://www.hrsa.gov/sites/default/files/hrsa/oral-health/integration-oral-health.pdf\">https://www.hrsa.gov/sites/default/files/hrsa/oral-health/integration-oral-health.pdf</a>) emphasize optimal collaborations between primary care clinicians and oral health professionals.</p>\r\n<p>The US Department of Health and Human Services&rsquo; <em>Report of the Surgeon General</em> (<a href=\"https://www.nidcr.nih.gov/sites/default/files/2017-10/hck1ocv.%40www.surgeon.fullrpt.pdf\">https://www.nidcr.nih.gov/sites/default/files/2017-10/hck1ocv.%40www.surgeon.fullrpt.pdf</a>) and the National Institutes of Health&rsquo;s report <em>Oral Health in America: Advances and Challenges</em> (<a href=\"https://www.nidcr.nih.gov/sites/default/files/2021-12/Oral-Health-in-America-Advances-and-Challenges.pdf\">https://www.nidcr.nih.gov/sites/default/files/2021-12/Oral-Health-in-America-Advances-and-Challenges.pdf</a>) comprehensively describe the importance of oral health to overall health and highlight advances and challenges toward improving oral health in the US.</p>\r\n<p>The Community Preventive Services Task Force recommends fluoridation of community water sources to reduce dental caries (<a href=\"https://www.thecommunityguide.org/findings/dental-caries-cavities-community-water-fluoridation\">https://www.thecommunityguide.org/findings/dental-caries-cavities-community-water-fluoridation</a>).</p>\r\n<h3>Other Related USPSTF Recommendations</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF has issued recommendations on screening and interventions to prevent dental caries in children younger than 5 years;<sup>15</sup> screening for oral cancer;<sup>16</sup> interventions for tobacco smoking cessation in adults, including pregnant persons;<sup>17</sup> and screening and preventive interventions for oral health in children and adolescents aged 5 to 17 years.<sup>18</sup></p>","other":"<h2>Supporting Evidence</h2><h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF commissioned a systematic evidence review<sup>1,19</sup> to evaluate the benefits and harms of screening and preventive interventions for oral health conditions in adults. The USPSTF previously addressed counseling to prevent dental and periodontal disease (1996). Concurrently, the USPSTF commissioned a systematic evidence review to evaluate the benefits and harms of oral health screening and preventive interventions in children and adolescents aged 5 to 17 years;<sup>20</sup> this recommendation is addressed in a separate statement.<sup>21</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found limited evidence on available and appropriate screening instruments or clinical risk assessments to identify adults with oral health conditions in the primary care setting. The review identified 6 studies (n = 1281) of self-reported questionnaires on perceived dental health designed to distinguish between persons with and without periodontitis, but most questionnaires included whether there was a history of periodontitis, making them less relevant for screening in asymptomatic persons or those with previously unrecognized oral periodontitis.<sup>1,19</sup> The questionnaires demonstrated moderate discrimination (area under summary receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.75-0.83]).<sup>1,19</sup> The evidence review did not identify any questionnaires designed to identify adults with dental caries.</p>\r\n<p>The single primary care study<sup>22</sup> (n = 86) evaluating the accuracy of clinical examination to identify dental caries found high specificity for dental caries and periodontitis (range, 0.80-0.93) but low sensitivity for periodontitis (0.56 [95% CI, 0.38-0.74] and 0.42 [95% CI, 0.24-0.56] for 2 examiners) and variable sensitivity for dental caries (0.33 [95% CI, 0.12-0.62] and 0.83 [95% CI, 0.52-0.96]).<sup>1,19</sup></p>\r\n<p>The review found no evidence on the accuracy of risk assessment tools to identify adults at increased risk of future oral health outcomes.</p>\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Screening</h3>\r\n<p>For evidence on whether screening prevented negative oral health outcomes in adults in the primary care setting, the review identified a single study in pregnant persons<sup>23</sup> (n = 477) that compared no screening with a dental screening approach involving 2 questions and an optional oral cavity visual inspection by midwives. There were no statistically significant group differences in number of decayed teeth or filled teeth, and measures of periodontitis and birth outcomes in both groups were similar.<sup>1,19,23</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Screening</h3>\r\n<p>The same single study<sup>22</sup> (n = 477) evaluating screening vs no screening in pregnant persons did not report examining harms of screening.<sup>1,19</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Preventive Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF sought evidence on interventions implemented in a primary care setting that could prevent a broad collection of oral health conditions; however, the evidence review identified studies focused on dental caries interventions performed by dental health professionals in a dental setting. The USPSTF also sought evidence on the effectiveness of oral health behavioral counseling in a primary care setting to prevent oral health outcomes but found no such evidence.<sup>1,19</sup></p>\r\n<p>The following discussion focuses on preventive medications. Studies often had significant methodological limitations (eg, high attrition, unclear randomization, or uncertain applicability to the US) and did not report analysis by race, socioeconomic status, or other important social determinants of health. Studies inconsistently reported community water fluoridation levels or whether participants received oral health education, precluding evaluation of the effectiveness of these factors on oral health outcomes. The review did not find evidence evaluating the effects of interventions on nonoral health outcomes such as cardiovascular or cognitive outcomes, quality of life, or functional status.<sup>1,19</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Topical Fluoride</h4>\r\n<p>The review found no evidence on fluoride interventions provided by primary care clinicians. Five trials (n = 971) in adults reported on the effects of topical fluorides (varnish or gel/solution) applied by dental professionals to prevent dental caries.<sup>1,19</sup> In the single randomized clinical trial<sup>24</sup> (n = 104) of older adults in residential and nursing homes, application of fluoride varnish (sodium fluoride 22,600 ppm) every 3 months was associated with a statistically nonsignificant reduction in dental caries at 1 year (mean difference in new active dental caries or fillings, 0.7; <em>P</em> &gt; .05), but at 2 and 3 years, group differences were statistically significant (mean difference, 1.8; <em>P</em> &lt; .001 and mean difference, 1.6; <em>P</em> &lt; .001, respectively).<sup>1,19</sup> In addition, fluoride varnish was associated with decreased risk of developing new dental caries (relative risk, 0.25 [95% CI, 0.10-0.63]), translating to a number needed to treat of 3.1 (95% CI, 2.1-7.7).<sup>1,19</sup> A nonrandomized cluster trial<sup>25</sup> (n = 232) of older adults in long-term care facilities found no group differences in dental caries burden (based on DMFT/DFT [Decayed, Missing, and Filled Teeth/Decayed, Filled Teeth] score) at 1 year (adjusted mean difference, &minus;0.04 [95% CI, &minus;0.10 to 0.03]).<sup>1,19</sup> The 3 additional trials of other topical fluoride approaches (sodium fluoride 2% solution, stannous fluoride [30%] paste followed by aqueous solution, and acidulated phosphate fluoride [1.2%] at varied time frames) obtained inconsistent results.<sup>1,19</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Sealants, Silver Diamine Fluoride, and Xylitol</h4>\r\n<p>The review found no studies on the effectiveness of sealants vs no sealants to prevent dental caries in primary care. Two trials (n = 178) evaluating light-cured resin-based sealants in young adults applied by dental professionals were of limited quality and yielded imprecise results.<sup>1,19</sup> Three trials (n = 590) examined the effectiveness of silver diamine fluoride solution to reduce dental caries or fillings in older adults.<sup>1,19</sup> Fluoride exposure (ie, oral health behaviors) was reported in 1 study and not reported in 2 studies.<sup>1,19</sup> In older adults, evidence suggests that silver diamine fluoride may be more effective than placebo to reduce new root dental caries or fillings (mean difference, &minus;0.33 to &minus;1.3 at 24 to 30 months).<sup>1</sup> Silver diamine fluoride may also reduce likelihood of developing new root dental caries (adjusted odds ratio, 0.4 [95% CI, 0.3-0.7] and relative risk, 0.19 [95% CI, 0.07-0.46] in 2 randomized clinical trials; n = 478).<sup>1,19</sup> No evidence was found evaluating the effects of xylitol to prevent dental caries or periodontitis.<sup>1,19</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Preventive Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>The review found very limited evidence on the harms of interventions. Of the 9 studies reviewed assessing preventive interventions, 1 trial evaluating fluoride varnish or silver diamine fluoride (vs placebo) stated &ldquo;no major side effects or discomfort was reported.&rdquo;<sup>1,19,24</sup> Eight other trials did not report examining for harms.<sup>1,19</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from May 23, 2023, to June 20, 2023. Some comments suggested that a recommendation supporting primary care screening and preventive interventions could expand dental care access and positively impact oral health disparities. The USPSTF is committed to advancing health equity and to the provision of equitable clinical preventive services to improve health. The USPSTF carefully considers evidence of benefits and harms, makes recommendations when supported by sufficient evidence, and makes recommendations on primary care&ndash;relevant services. However, based on the evidence, the USPSTF cannot recommend for or against oral health screening or preventive interventions for adults in the primary care setting. Primary care clinicians should use their clinical expertise to decide whether to perform these services. The USPSTF is calling for additional research to fill critical evidence gaps on this topic. Several comments agreed that the evidence is too limited to make a recommendation for or against primary care&ndash;feasible oral health screening or preventive interventions in adults.</p><h2>Research Needs and Gaps</h2><p>See <a href=\"#tab2\">Table 2</a> for research needs and gaps related to screening and preventive interventions for oral health in adults.</p><h2>Recommendations of Others</h2><p>The US Department of Health and Human Services&rsquo; <em>Report of the Surgeon General</em> (2000) and the National Institutes of Health&rsquo;s update (2021) emphasize the importance of integrating oral health into primary care medical settings, primarily focusing on counseling, coordination, and referral.<sup>2,14</sup> The National Academy of Medicine&rsquo;s (formerly the Institute of Medicine) and the Health Resources and Services Administration&rsquo;s report <em>Advancing Oral Health in America</em> (2011) recommends strategic action for prioritization of oral health within US Department of Health and Human Services agencies and in its partnerships with other stakeholders.<sup>5</sup></p>\r\n<p>The American Dental Association (2013) recommends professionally applied 2.26% fluoride varnish or 1.23% fluoride gel in adults at elevated risk of developing dental caries.<sup>26</sup> The American Academy of Family Physicians (2018) recommends that primary care clinicians educate patients about risks and benefits of fluoride use.<sup>27</sup> The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (2013) recommends routine counseling about the importance of oral health care during pregnancy and maintaining good oral health habits throughout the life span.<sup>28</sup></p><h2>Table 2.

This cumulative exposure to abnormal lipid levels over time can lead to early atherosclerotic changes and premature cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Diagnosis of FH is variably defined but generally includes substantially elevated lipid levels, a monogenic mutation, or both. There are several variants that can individually lead to the FH phenotype, so genetic testing includes examination for each of these variants.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<p>Multifactorial dyslipidemia is a condition of elevated lipid levels primarily associated with environmental factors such as excessive intake of saturated fat, sedentary lifestyle, and obesity; polygenic variants with small additive effects may also contribute to the condition. Abnormal lipid values associated with multifactorial dyslipidemia are generally lower than those associated with FH.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>Although there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening in young patients without signs or symptoms, a serum lipid panel is the most commonly proposed screening test for FH and multifactorial dyslipidemia. Lipid panels measure different components of cholesterol metabolism, including total cholesterol, LDL-C, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), non&ndash;HDL-C, and triglycerides.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>Treatment interventions to lower lipid levels generally include lifestyle modification (eg, changes in diet and physical activity), pharmacotherapy (eg, statins, bile acid sequestering agents, or cholesterol absorption inhibitors), and dietary supplements (eg, plant sterols or fish oil). Statins are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use in children 8 years or older and are the first-line pharmacotherapy treatment for children with elevated LDL-C levels. Treatment algorithms for FH and multifactorial dyslipidemia differ because of the substantially higher lipid levels associated with FH.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>\r\n<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>\r\n<p>Familial hypercholesterolemia is generally asymptomatic in childhood and adolescence and is rarely associated with cardiovascular events in the first 2 decades of life. However, FH can cause early cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in adulthood from cumulative exposure to high LDL-C levels and atherosclerotic changes starting as early as age 8 years.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<p>Robust evidence from studies conducted primarily before statins were commonly used show that a diagnosis of FH substantially increases risk for cardiovascular events in adulthood. A meta-analysis of 68,565 adults from 6 US cohorts found that the FH phenotype, defined by an LDL-C level of 190 mg/dL or greater (to convert LDL-C values to mmol/L, multiply by 0.0259), was associated with an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 4.1 (95% CI, 1.2-13.4) for cardiovascular disease events over 30 years of follow-up, compared with a reference group defined by an LDL-C level of less than 130 mg/dL. Investigators also found that the FH phenotype accelerated coronary heart disease risk by 10 to 20 years in men and 20 to 30 years in women.<sup>3</sup> Observational studies in adults with FH recruited from lipid clinics suggest that the prognosis of FH has improved substantially with the advent of statin treatment.<sup>4,5</sup></p>\r\n<p>Prognostic data for FH as determined by genotype (rather than LDL-C levels) are more limited. Data suggest that carriers of the FH genetic variant are at increased risk for coronary artery disease at any level of LDL-C. For example, the odds ratio for coronary artery disease was 5.2 (95% CI, 4.4-6.2) for an individual with an LDL-C level of 190 to 220 mg/dL or greater but without a genetic variant (compared with an individual with an LDL-C level &lt;130 mg/dL and no genetic variant). However, the odds ratio for coronary heart disease was 17.0 (95% CI, 5.3-77.9) among individuals with this level of LDL-C in the presence of an FH genetic variant.<sup>6</sup></p>\r\n<p>Multifactorial dyslipidemia in adulthood is widely established as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease based on evidence showing strong associations between cholesterol levels in adulthood and ischemic heart disease mortality.<sup>7</sup> Linking elevated lipid levels in children to adult cardiovascular outcomes requires long follow-up. A 2022 publication from the International Childhood Cardiovascular Cohorts (i3C) Consortium suggests that elevated lipid levels in childhood (ages 3 to 19 years) are associated with fatal cardiovascular events in adulthood with 35 years of follow-up; however, the evidence is complicated by childhood risk factors tracking into adulthood and the lack of control for other risk factors.<sup>8</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Potential Harms</h4>\r\n<p>Available pharmacotherapy trials and observational follow-up studies in children and adolescents showed no significant differences in harms between control and intervention groups. Abnormal liver and musculoskeletal laboratory values were reported with statin use; however, most trials were short term and small with few events, leading to imprecise estimates. Additionally, the clinical importance of transient elevations in these laboratory values is unknown.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Current Practice</h4>\r\n<p>Lipid screening practices in US pediatric populations vary. Recent studies investigating screening practices in large US health care organizations found universal screening rates of 2% to 9% in children aged 9 to 11 years. Higher weight status, non-White race or ethnicity, and the presence of comorbid conditions were associated with higher screening rates in these studies.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<p>Screening based on risk factors can be unreliable, leading to underdiagnosis and undertreatment. The genetic disorder that causes FH is not related to obesity, and studies show that patient reports of family history of lipid disorders or premature cardiovascular events are inaccurate. Higher body mass index is a risk factor for multifactorial dyslipidemia; however, screening guided by weight status alone could miss a significant number of children with multifactorial dyslipidemia who do not have overweight or obesity. Another approach sometimes used is universal screening in certain age groups.<sup>1,9,10</sup></p>\r\n<p>There are no universally accepted criteria for the diagnosis of FH. A combination of elevated lipid levels, physical findings, family history, or genetic tests are used to establish the diagnosis. Abnormal lipid value cut points for defining multifactorial dyslipidemia are based on population norms and correspond to approximately the 95th percentile of population-based cohorts. These thresholds, however, have not been validated as predictors for cardiovascular disease events and are not age- and sex-specific.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Additional Tools and Resources</h3>\r\n<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute&rsquo;s Expert Panel on Integrated Guidelines for Cardiovascular Health and Risk Reduction in Children and Adolescents developed comprehensive, evidence-based guidelines addressing the known risk factors for cardiovascular disease to assist all primary care professionals in both the promotion of cardiovascular health and the identification and management of specific risk factors from infancy into young adult life (<a href=\"https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/node/80308\">https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/node/80308</a>).<sup>9</sup></p>\r\n<p>The US Department of Health and Human Services published the &ldquo;Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans,&rdquo; which provide evidence-based recommendations for how physical activity can help promote health and reduce the risk of chronic disease for Americans 3 years or older (<a href=\"https://health.gov/our-work/nutrition-physical-activity/physical-activity-guidelines\">https://health.gov/our-work/nutrition-physical-activity/physical-activity-guidelines</a>).<sup>11</sup></p>\r\n<p>The US Departments of Agriculture and Health and Human Services published the &ldquo;Dietary Guidelines for Americans,&rdquo; which provide advice on what to eat and drink at every stage of life to build a healthy diet that can help prevent chronic diseases (<a href=\"https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/\">https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/</a>).<sup>12</sup></p>\r\n<p>The Community Preventive Services Task Force recommends interventions promoting physical activity and healthy eating across the life span, including specific recommendations for youth (<a href=\"https://www.thecommunityguide.org/\">https://www.thecommunityguide.org/</a>).<sup>13</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Other Related USPSTF Recommendations</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF recommends that clinicians screen for obesity in children 6 years or older and offer them or refer them to a comprehensive, intensive behavioral intervention to promote improvements in weight status (B recommendation).<sup>14</sup> The USPSTF found insufficient evidence on screening for high blood pressure in children and adolescents to prevent subsequent cardiovascular disease in childhood or adulthood (I statement).<sup>15</sup></p><h2>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h2><p>In 2016, the USPSTF found insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for lipid disorders in children and adolescents 20 years or younger (I statement).<sup>16</sup> This recommendation concurs with the previous I statement.</p>","other":"<h2>Supporting Evidence</h2><h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF commissioned a systematic review to evaluate the benefits and harms of screening for lipid disorders in asymptomatic children and adolescents.<sup>1,17</sup> In 2016, separate reports were issued for FH and multifactorial dyslipidemia. The current systematic evidence review presents updated evidence in a single report that clearly delineates the evidence specific to each condition. The review on FH focuses on heterozygous FH because it is the most common monogenic cause of dyslipidemia. Dyslipidemia due to homozygous FH or secondary causes (such as diabetes, nephrotic syndrome, or hypothyroidism), and targeted screening based on family history of premature cardiovascular events, are outside the scope of the review.</p>\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening Tests and Risk Assessment</h3>\r\n<p>No studies performed a confirmatory lipid or genetic test; thus, evidence is limited to screen positivity (prevalence) rather than diagnostic yield of lipid screening for identifying FH and multifactorial dyslipidemia. Prevalence of any lipid abnormality in 6- to 19-year-olds was 19.2% based on 2013 to 2016 data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (n = 4381).<sup>1,17</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Familial Hypercholesterolemia</h4>\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed 3 fair-quality US studies (n = 395,465) reporting prevalence of FH ranging from 0.2% to 0.4% (1/250 to 1/500) using diagnostic criteria exclusively based on lipid levels (LDL-C &ge;190 mg/dL or total cholesterol &ge;270 mg/dL [to convert total cholesterol values to mmol/L, multiply by 0.0259]).<sup>1,17</sup> One study screening for cardiovascular risk factors among fifth graders (n = 20,266) found that among 14,468 students with a positive family history of premature cardiovascular disease, 1.2% had a fasting LDL-C level of 160 mg/dL or greater; 1.7% of 5798 students without a family history of premature cardiovascular disease had a fasting LDL-C level of 160 mg/dL or greater.<sup>18</sup> These results show that targeted screening in children with a family history of hypercholesterolemia or premature cardiovascular disease would miss many cases of children with an elevated LDL-C level of 160 mg/dL or greater.</p>\r\n<h4>Multifactorial Dyslipidemia</h4>\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed 5 fair-quality studies (n = 142,257) reporting prevalence of multifactorial dyslipidemia. Prevalence ranged from 7.1% to 9.4% for elevated total cholesterol level (&ge;200 mg/dL), 6.4% to 7.4% for elevated LDL-C level (&ge;130 mg/dL), 12.1% to 22.2% for low HDL-C level (&lt;40 mg/dL [to convert HDL-C values to mmol/L, multiply by 0.0259]), 8.0% to 17.3% for elevated triglyceride level (using various thresholds), and 6.4% to 13.0% for elevated non&ndash;HDL-C level (&ge;145 mg/dL [to convert non&ndash;HDL-C values to mmol/L, multiply by 0.0259]). Older age and higher body mass index were associated with higher prevalence of multifactorial dyslipidemia.<sup>1,17</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>No studies directly assessed the effectiveness of screening for FH or multifactorial dyslipidemia in children and adolescents to delay or reduce poor health outcomes (eg, myocardial infarctions, strokes, or cardiovascular-related or all-cause deaths) or improve intermediate outcomes (eg, serum lipid levels or atherosclerotic markers).<sup>1,17</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Familial Hypercholesterolemia</h4>\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed 22 fair- to good-quality trials (n = 2257) examining the effectiveness of lipid-lowering treatments in individuals with FH, including pharmacotherapy, behavioral counseling, and dietary supplements. Trials were generally small and short term, and none reported effects on cardiovascular events or mortality. The evidence was strongest for statins causing the highest reductions in total cholesterol and LDL-C levels. Pharmacological effect on triglyceride and HDL-C levels was mixed. The review included 10 fair- to good-quality randomized clinical trials (n = 1230) of statins, with follow-up for up to 2 years. Pooled analyses demonstrated that statins were associated with an 81- to 82-mg/dL greater mean reduction in total cholesterol and LDL-C levels compared with placebo (total cholesterol: 7 studies [n = 706]; mean difference in change, &minus;82.1 mg/dL [95% CI, &minus;101.1 to &minus;63.2 mg/dL]; LDL-C: 8 studies [n = 742]; mean difference in change, &minus;81.3 mg/dL [95% CI, &minus;97.6 to &minus;65.0 mg/dL]). Other studies reporting lipid-lowering effects from bile acid sequestrant, ezetimibe, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitor, and statin plus ezetimibe combination drugs showed statistically significant reductions, but none as substantial as from statins alone; mean reduction in total cholesterol and LDL-C levels from nonstatin drugs peaked around &minus;69 mg/dL. Despite large changes in LDL-C levels associated with statins, many children with FH do not achieve LDL-C goals due to high baseline values. No more than 60% of participants in the statin group achieved goal in 4 trials reporting this metric.<sup>1,17</sup></p>\r\n<p>Evidence from a very small, fair-quality behavioral counseling trial in an FH population (n = 21) showed that this intervention was not effective in lowering lipid levels or changing physical activity or diet behaviors. Supplements showed mixed results, with the best evidence supporting plant sterol spreads. Two fair-quality plant sterol supplement trials (n = 82) in FH populations showed statistically significant reductions of 20.5 to 30.5 mg/dL in total cholesterol level and 22.4 to 30.1 mg/dL in LDL-C level at 4 to 8 weeks. Two trials of omega-3 fatty acids did not show a statistically significant difference in lipid level changes between the intervention and control groups.<sup>1,17</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Multifactorial Dyslipidemia</h4>\r\n<p>No trials of drug interventions in children and adolescents with multifactorial dyslipidemia met inclusion criteria. The USPSTF reviewed 4 fair- to good-quality trials (n = 1008) examining the effectiveness of various nonpharmacologic lipid-lowering treatments for multifactorial dyslipidemia. Two behavioral counseling trials (n = 934) with dietary interventions varying in intensity, duration, and follow-up showed a 3- to 6-mg/dL statistically significant reduction in total cholesterol and LDL-C levels and improvements in dietary intake in the intervention group compared with the control group; however, these findings did not persist at longer follow-up. Two small, fair-quality supplement intervention trials (n = 74) examining flaxseed and fish oil in populations with multifactorial dyslipidemia showed that these supplements did not improve lipid outcomes at 4 to 8 weeks.<sup>1,17</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Familial Hypercholesterolemia or Multifactorial Dyslipidemia</h4>\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed 7 fair- to good-quality short-term supplement trials (n = 288) in populations of children and adolescents with FH or multifactorial dyslipidemia. Results for various supplement interventions were limited, inconsistent, or showed no difference between intervention and control groups.<sup>1,17</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Screening and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>No studies reported on the harms of screening for FH or multifactorial dyslipidemia in children and adolescents.<sup>1,17</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Familial Hypercholesterolemia</h4>\r\n<p>Overall, harms reported in pharmacotherapy trials were similar in the intervention and control groups; however, most studies were relatively short term and small, with few events, leading to imprecise estimates. Further, the clinical importance of transient elevations in liver enzyme or creatine kinase levels is unknown.<sup>1,17</sup></p>\r\n<p>In the statin trials discussed above, elevated liver enzyme levels of 3 times or more the upper limit of normal occurred in 0% to 4.5% of participants in intervention groups and 0% to 1.9% of participants in control groups. The largest trial (n = 214), with 2-year follow-up, reported no cases in the statin group and only 2 cases meeting the more than 3 times the upper limit of normal threshold in the control group. In the 10-year observational follow-up of this trial, elevated liver enzyme levels at this threshold were similarly rare.<sup>1,17</sup> Elevations in musculoskeletal laboratory values were also rare. Abnormal creatine kinase levels of 10 times or more the upper limit of normal ranged from 0% to 4.5% among participants in the statin group and from 0% to 1.7% among participants in the control group; 10-year observational follow-up in 1 trial reported no instances of elevated creatine kinase levels. There were no significant differences in Tanner staging or hormonal adverse events between statin and placebo groups in these trials or with longer observational follow-up. A fair-quality observational study (n = 9393) evaluating the association of statins and new-onset diabetes showed no difference in new diabetes diagnoses over up to 9 years of follow-up in individuals taking statins compared with control groups.<sup>1,17</sup></p>\r\n<p>Studies reporting adverse events in nonstatin trials were small and short term and showed similar harms between the control and intervention groups. The diet and physical activity counseling intervention trial did not mention harms, and the 3 supplement trials for FH reported that there were no adverse events.<sup>1,17</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Multifactorial Dyslipidemia</h4>\r\n<p>The 2 behavioral counseling trials discussed above reported no harms associated with this intervention. One small flaxseed study (n = 32) noted a worsening in HDL-C and triglyceride levels;<sup>1</sup> however, the small study size and fluctuation of lipid laboratory values over time and in different age groups makes the clinical significance of this finding unknown. A small fish oil study (n = 42) noted that gastrointestinal symptoms, fishy taste, and frequent nosebleeds were more common in the intervention group than in the control group.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Familial Hypercholesterolemia or Multifactorial Dyslipidemia</h4>\r\n<p>In studies including individuals with FH or multifactorial dyslipidemia, gastrointestinal adverse effects were observed with fiber supplements. However, these studies were limited and had short trial durations of 5 to 16 weeks.<sup>1,17</sup></p>\r\n<h3>How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?</h3>\r\n<p>The association between elevated adult lipid levels and adult cardiovascular events is well established. Evidence linking abnormal lipid levels in childhood to adult cardiovascular disease requires studies with decades-long follow-up. Three robust analyses suggest that cumulative exposure to elevated lipid levels in childhood and young adulthood is associated with adult cardiovascular disease; however, the evidence has limitations. The i3C Consortium published a pooled analysis of 7 prospective cohort studies (n = 38,589) that followed up participants who had cardiovascular risk factors measured in childhood over a mean of 35 years and evaluated subsequent cardiovascular events in adulthood. Hazard ratios for a fatal cardiovascular event in adulthood were 1.30 (95% CI, 1.14-1.47) per unit increase in the <em>z</em> score for total cholesterol level (which describes standard deviations from the mean) and 1.50 (95% CI, 1.33-1.70) per unit increase in the <em>z</em> score for triglyceride level. This increased risk, however, dissipated and became statistically nonsignificant when a combined risk factor score for adults was considered, suggesting that the effect occurs largely because childhood risk factors track to adult risk factors. Additionally, the analysis used combined risk factors, so individual cardiovascular risk factors, such as lipid levels exclusively, were not examined independently.<sup>8</sup></p>\r\n<p>A pooled analysis of 36,030 participants from 6 US-based cohort studies with a median follow-up period of 17 years examined the independent association between exposure to high lipid levels in young adulthood (ages 18 to 39 years) and later cardiovascular events. Results showed that exposure to LDL-C levels of 100 mg/dL or greater in young adulthood was associated with an adjusted HR of 1.64 (95% CI, 1.27-2.11) for coronary heart disease compared with LDL-C levels of less than 100 mg/dL in young adulthood.<sup>19</sup> Another study selected genes associated with lower LDL-C levels and through a meta-analysis quantified the association between long-term lower LDL-C levels and the risk of coronary heart disease. Results suggested that lower LDL-C levels throughout the life span were associated with substantially lower risk of coronary heart disease in adulthood compared with initiating lipid-lowering treatment later in life.<sup>20</sup> Limitations for applicability of these data include risk factors that were combined and not independently evaluated, generalizability to younger ages in studies in which participants were young adults, and measurement of health outcome in the third or fourth decade of life, which may be too early to detect a cardiovascular event.</p>\r\n<p>A new 20-year follow-up study (n = 214) from a randomized clinical trial of children and their parents identified with FH demonstrated that early initiation of statins in adolescence was associated with improved cumulative cardiovascular disease&ndash;free survival at age 39 years compared with their parents&rsquo; delayed treatment in adulthood. Children with confirmed FH who started statins in youth (mean statin initiation age, 14.0 [SD, 3.1] years) had higher rates of cardiovascular disease&ndash;free survival compared with their parents, for whom statins were not available until adulthood (99% vs 74% cardiovascular disease&ndash;free survival; HR, 11.8 [95% CI, 3.0-107.0], adjusted for sex and smoking status).<sup>21</sup> Although these data hold promise, several study characteristics may make results hard to translate to a general screen-detected pediatric population, including small sample size; generalizability to a primary care pediatric population, because all participants were recruited from a lipid clinic and ultimately confirmed to have an FH genetic mutation; and applicability to the US population in which genetic testing for FH may not be widely available or easily accessible.</p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from January 24, 2023, to February 21, 2023.

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (including preeclampsia) were responsible for 6.8% of pregnancy-related deaths in the US during 2014 to 2017.<sup>5</sup> Most deaths attributed to hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (65%) occur in the 6 weeks following delivery.<sup>6</sup> Adverse perinatal outcomes for the fetus and newborn include intrauterine growth restriction, low birth weight, and stillbirth.<sup>1-3</sup> Many of the complications associated with preeclampsia lead to early induction of labor or cesarean delivery and preterm birth. Preeclampsia has been estimated to account for 6% of preterm births and 19% of medically indicated preterm births in the US.<sup>7</sup> Having any hypertensive disorder of pregnancy (particularly preeclampsia) is associated with an increased risk of maternal chronic hypertension and cardiovascular disease later in life.<sup>8-10</sup></p>\r\n<p>In the US, Black persons experience higher rates of maternal and infant morbidity and perinatal mortality than other racial and ethnic groups and are at greater risk for developing hypertensive disorders of pregnancy than other pregnant persons.<sup>1,11,12</sup> In 2019, the maternal mortality rate (maternal deaths during and up to 42 days postpartum) was higher among Black persons than among White persons (44.0 per 100,000 live births vs 17.9 per 100,000 live births, respectively).<sup>13</sup> Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy account for a larger proportion of pregnancy-related morbidity and mortality among Black populations than White populations.<sup>14-19</sup> Approximately two-thirds of Black persons with preeclampsia are diagnosed with having severe symptoms, compared with fewer than half of White persons developing preeclampsia.<sup>14,17</sup> These disparities in disease severity contribute to the higher overall maternal mortality rates observed in Black populations.<sup>20</sup> The risk of dying of eclampsia and preeclampsia is about 5 times greater for Black individuals (3.93 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births) than for White individuals (0.78 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births).<sup>1,18</sup></p>\r\n<p>Pregnancy-related mortality among Native American/Alaska Native persons is also elevated compared with White persons (29.7 maternal deaths vs 12.7 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births in 2007 to 2016, respectively), with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy accounting for 12.8% of pregnancy-related deaths.<sup>14</sup> Native American/Alaska Native individuals have significantly higher severe maternal morbidity rates compared with other racial and ethnic groups (11.7% vs 3.9% for White individuals).<sup>20</sup></p><h2>USPSTF Assessment of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h2><p>The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) concludes with moderate certainty that screening for hypertensive disorders in pregnancy with blood pressure measurements has <strong>substantial net benefit</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>See the <a href=\"#tab\">Table</a> for more information on the USPSTF recommendation rationale and assessment.

The presence of any systemic signs or symptoms of severe hypertension (systolic blood pressure &ge;160 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure &ge;110 mm Hg) is indicative of preeclampsia with severe features; HELLP syndrome is a severe form of preeclampsia that is diagnosed based on a constellation of laboratory findings (hemolysis, elevated liver enzyme levels, and low platelet count).</li>\r\n<li>Eclampsia is new onset of seizures in the absence of other potential causes such as epilepsy.</li>\r\n<li>Gestational hypertension is new-onset hypertension after the 20th week of gestation in a person with previously normal blood pressure.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>\r\n<p>Important clinical conditions associated with increased risk for preeclampsia include a history of eclampsia or preeclampsia in a prior pregnancy, a previous adverse pregnancy outcome, and maternal comorbid conditions (including type 1 or type 2 diabetes prior to pregnancy, gestational diabetes, chronic hypertension, kidney disease, and autoimmune diseases).<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<p>Other factors associated with increased risk of preeclampsia and gestational hypertension include nulliparity, high prepregnancy body mass index, family history of preeclampsia, multifetal gestation, and the pregnant individual being 35 years or older.<sup>1,22</sup></p>\r\n<p>The higher prevalence of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and the increased risk for severe complications seen in Black persons may be due to their disproportionate burden of social and clinical risk factors. These social and clinical determinants largely result from historical and current manifestations of structural racism that influence environmental exposures, access to health resources, and overall health status.<sup>1,22</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>Blood pressure measurements are routinely used as a screening tool for hypertensive disorders throughout pregnancy and the postpartum period. Accurate blood pressure measurement requires an appropriate technique, a device validated for use in pregnancy, and a cuff of an appropriate size for the patient.<sup>2,23</sup> Blood pressure is measured with a sphygmomanometer by detecting sounds (auscultatory method) or by recording pulsations (oscillometric method).<sup>1,24</sup> A positive screening result for new-onset hypertension during pregnancy is defined as an elevated blood pressure reading (systolic blood pressure &ge;140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure &ge;90 mm Hg in the absence of chronic hypertension) measured twice at least 4 hours apart.<sup>2</sup> A patient with multiple elevated blood pressure readings should have further diagnostic evaluation and clinical monitoring.</p>\r\n<p>Other screening evaluations include testing for proteinuria when preeclampsia is suspected. Previously, the USPSTF found adequate evidence that point-of-care tests for protein in the urine (eg, urine dipstick) had low accuracy for detecting proteinuria in pregnancy.<sup>25</sup> Evidence does not support routine point-of-care urine tests to screen for preeclampsia, because studies suggest that proteinuria alone may not be a good predictor of preeclampsia health outcomes.<sup>25-27</sup> Proteinuria measurement is used in the diagnostic criteria for preeclampsia.<sup>1,2</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Screening Interval</h3>\r\n<p>Blood pressure measurements should be obtained during each prenatal care visit throughout pregnancy. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy can quickly evolve into severe disease that can result in serious, even fatal, maternal and infant health outcomes. The ability to screen for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy using blood pressure measurements is important to identify and effectively treat a potentially unpredictable and fatal condition. While it is known that risk continues into the immediate postpartum period, there is little evidence regarding screening during this period. A pragmatic approach would be for patients to be counseled regarding signs and symptoms of preeclampsia at hospital discharge and for patients with hypertensive disorders to have subsequent blood pressure checks.</p>\r\n<p>Screening for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy alone is not sufficient to improve inequities in health outcomes. Identifying hypertensive disorders of pregnancy requires adequate prenatal visits, surveillance, and evidence-based care in response to evolving patient signs and symptoms during pregnancy and the postpartum period to improve health outcomes.<sup>1</sup> Black and Native American/Alaska Native persons have lower rates of prenatal visits and are at greater risk of serious postpartum morbidity and hospital readmission after delivery.<sup>1,28-31</sup> Screening and monitoring of Black and Hispanic/Latina individuals during the postpartum period could be an important step for reducing health inequities by preventing serious adverse events.<sup>1,31</sup> In addition, screening and monitoring by various health care providers (eg, nurse midwives, nurses, pediatricians, doulas, and lactation consultants) could also help avert serious complications in the postpartum period.<sup>1,32,33</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>There is no other currently available treatment for preeclampsia except delivery. The timing of delivery depends on gestational age and whether severe features of preeclampsia are present. Management strategies for diagnosed hypertensive disorders of pregnancy include close fetal and maternal monitoring, antihypertension medications, and magnesium sulfate for seizure prophylaxis when indicated.<sup>4,5</sup> Postpartum blood pressure measurement and clinical monitoring of patients diagnosed with hypertensive disorders during pregnancy are also important, since the preeclampsia mortality risks continue after delivery.</p>\r\n<p>One possible way to address the racial and ethnic inequities in the incidence and severity of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy is for health care systems to provide better support during pregnancy for populations at risk, such as Black and Native American/Alaska Native populations.<sup>1</sup> Increasing clinician awareness of populations with an increased risk of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy may help improve equitable dissemination of preventive measures.<sup>1</sup> For example, the USPSTF has recommended that all pregnant Black individuals should be considered for low-dose aspirin use to prevent preeclampsia, with aspirin use recommended for those with at least 1 additional moderate risk factor.<sup>34</sup> Clinicians should also be aware of the risks of poor health outcomes for populations at risk. For instance, Black and Hispanic/Latina persons have a 2 times higher risk of stroke with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy compared with White persons.<sup>1,31</sup> This knowledge could encourage clinicians to focus resources on patients most likely to experience morbidity or mortality.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<p>Race and ethnicity may influence the likelihood of patients receiving recommended treatments.<sup>1,35</sup> To achieve the benefit of screening once a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy is detected, ongoing monitoring and evidence-based management of the condition is needed to reduce the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. The use of standardized clinical bundles of best practices for disease management of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy could help ensure that all pregnant persons receive appropriate, equitable care.<sup>1,35-37</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Implementation</h3>\r\n<p>Sources of inequity that cause or exacerbate hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and pregnancy outcomes include structural racism and interpersonal racism, which can lead to disparities in access to high-quality health care. Structural and interpersonal racism can also produce disparities in living conditions such as education level, nutrition, stress level, income, and environmental exposures. These disparities can have profound effects on health status.<sup>1,19</sup> Given the complex factors that contribute to health inequities, approaches to consider in mitigating disparities in hypertensive disorders of pregnancy include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Connections to community resources in the perinatal period<sup>1</sup></li>\r\n<li>Collaborative care provided in medical homes<sup>1</sup></li>\r\n<li>Multilevel interventions (eg, individual, community, and health care system or policies, health systems, and clinical practices) to address underlying health inequities that increase health risks in pregnancy (eg, chronic hypertension and type 2 diabetes)<sup>1</sup></li>\r\n<li>The use of telehealth and remote monitoring in prenatal and postpartum care<sup>1</sup></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Additional research is needed to evaluate these innovative approaches.</p>\r\n<h3>Additional Tools and Resources</h3>\r\n<p>Million Hearts is a national initiative that provides tools and resources for cardiovascular health, including hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (<a href=\"https://millionhearts.hhs.gov/tools-protocols/tools/hypertension-disorders-pregnancy.html\">https://millionhearts.hhs.gov/tools-protocols/tools/hypertension-disorders-pregnancy.html</a>).</p>\r\n<p>The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development has information on preeclampsia and eclampsia (<a href=\"https://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/preeclampsia\">https://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/preeclampsia</a>).</p>\r\n<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has information about high blood pressure during pregnancy (<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/bloodpressure/pregnancy.htm\">https://www.cdc.gov/bloodpressure/pregnancy.htm</a>).</p>\r\n<p>The Community Preventive Services Task Force recommends exercise programs for pregnant women to reduce the development of gestational hypertension (<a href=\"https://www.thecommunityguide.org/findings/pregnancy-health-exercise-programs-prevent-gestational-hypertension.html\">https://www.thecommunityguide.org/findings/pregnancy-health-exercise-programs-prevent-gestational-hypertension.html</a>).</p>\r\n<h3>Other Related USPSTF Recommendations</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF recommends the use of low-dose aspirin (81 mg/d) as preventive medication after 12 weeks of gestation in persons at high risk for preeclampsia.<sup>34</sup> Other related USPSTF recommendations for pregnant persons are available at <a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/\">https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/</a>.</p><h2>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h2><p>This recommendation is consistent with the 2017 recommendation statement, which recommends screening with blood pressure measurements throughout pregnancy (B recommendation).<sup>25</sup></p>","other":"<h2>Supporting Evidence</h2><h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF commissioned a systematic evidence review to update and assess the evidence on screening for preeclampsia.<sup>1,38</sup> The approach to the screening and clinical management of preeclampsia and other hypertensive disorders of pregnancy includes similar interventions. Therefore, the USPSTF broadened the scope of the updated review from screening for preeclampsia to screening for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Given the foundational evidence base already established on the benefits of screening for elevated blood pressure during pregnancy, this review focused on assessing the comparative effectiveness of different screening approaches that vary by gestational timing, frequency, and modality. The update reviewed the following screening approaches: (1) the use of screening with home blood pressure measurement to supplement or replace office-based blood pressure measurement in prenatal or postpartum care; (2) different prenatal or postpartum screening visit schedules, in terms of the timing and number of blood pressure measurements over the course of pregnancy and beyond; and (3) indicated rather than routine urine screening to detect proteinuria in pregnancy.<sup>1,38</sup> In alignment with the USPSTF&rsquo;s commitment to improve health equity, the evidence review included contextual questions on the drivers behind and approaches to address disparities in health outcomes related to hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. These contextual questions are designed to provide additional information about addressing health inequities in practice and may not reflect the same evidence thresholds as key questions.</p>\r\n<h3>Detection or Screening Programs</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF has previously assessed the accuracy of office, home-based, and ambulatory blood pressure measurements to identify hypertension in adults as adequate.<sup>39</sup> In this update, the USPSTF found evidence related to 3 different screening approaches (ie, home blood pressure measurements, fewer blood pressure measurements for patients at low risk for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and indicated rather than routine urine screening for proteinuria). The different screening approaches used in the trials did not reduce or increase the diagnoses of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.<sup>1,38</sup> A trial (n = 2441) that evaluated home blood pressure measurement as a supplement to routine office-based screening found no statistically significant differences between the intervention and control groups in number of days to detect hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (mean, &minus;1.58 days [95% CI, &minus;8.10 to 4.94 days]), number of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy diagnoses (relative risk [RR], 0.98 [95% CI, 0.81-1.18]), or incidence of severe hypertension (RR, 1.22 [95% CI, 0.87-1.70]).<sup>1,38,40</sup></p>\r\n<p>Three trials (n = 5203) assessing a reduced prenatal screening visit schedule did not identify differences between groups in the proportion of participants receiving a diagnosis of preeclampsia.<sup>1,38,41-43</sup> In a large UK trial (n = 2794), fewer than 1% of study participants were diagnosed with preeclampsia (RR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.35-2.04]).<sup>1,38,42</sup> A large US trial (n = 2328) reported similar proportions of preeclampsia cases in the reduced visit intervention group (59/1165 [5.1%]) and the usual care control group (66/1163 [5.7%]) (RR, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.78-1.14]).<sup>1,38,44</sup> Cases of preeclampsia with severe features were also similar in the intervention (10/1165 [0.9%]) and control (9/1163 [0.8%]) groups (RR, 1.05 [95% CI, 0.68-1.62]).<sup>43</sup> A small US randomized clinical trial (RCT) (n = 81) lacked statistical power to estimate group differences.<sup>1,38,43</sup></p>\r\n<p>A nonrandomized study (n = 2441) compared indicated urine screening with a historical control cohort that received routine screening at every prenatal visit and demonstrated no difference in the proportion of individuals diagnosed with a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy (RR, 1.00 [95% CI, 0.74-1.36]).<sup>1,38,44</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF previously found adequate foundational evidence that the well-established management of preeclampsia can reduce maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality.<sup>25</sup></p>\r\n<p>Four fair-quality RCTs and 1 fair-quality nonrandomized study of interventions with a historical control were included in the review of screening benefits.<sup>1,38,40-44</sup> Three types of screening approaches were compared with usual care: screening programs that incorporated self-measurement of blood pressure, a reduced prenatal visit schedule for persons at low risk for complications of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and protein urine screening only when indicated rather than at every prenatal visit. None of the trials reported statistically significant differences across various serious health outcomes (eg, eclampsia, transient ischemic attack, stroke, HELLP syndrome, pulmonary edema, maternal and perinatal mortality, stillbirth, or intrauterine growth restriction/small for gestational size [IUGR/SGA]), but the effect estimates were imprecise due to inadequate statistical power.<sup>1,38</sup> Overall, the USPSTF found limited evidence on benefits associated with alternative approaches to screening for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.</p>\r\n<h4>Home Blood Pressure Measurement</h4>\r\n<p>One UK RCT, the Blood Pressure Monitoring in High Risk Pregnancy to Improve the Detection and Monitoring of Hypertension 1 (BUMP 1) trial (n = 2441), assessed the addition of home blood pressure measurement to measurement during prenatal visits in participants at increased risk of a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy based on common clinical risk factors (eg, nulliparity, age, family history, previous preeclampsia, body mass index &gt;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, twin pregnancy, or diabetes).<sup>40</sup> The trial evaluated home blood pressure measurement 3 times a week to supplement routine prenatal care among pregnant persons recruited at 16 to 24 weeks of gestation. The BUMP 1 trial was composed mostly of White (British, Irish, or other) participants (74%); it included smaller percentages of participants identifying as Asian or Asian British (10%), Black or Black British (8%), or &ldquo;other&rdquo; or &ldquo;mixed&rdquo; race or ethnicity (7%).<sup>1,38,40</sup> The home blood pressure measurement study found no significant differences in risk of IUGR/SGA between the intervention and control groups (RR, 1.15 [95% CI, 0.87-1.53]). Fewer than 2% of study participants experienced serious complications from hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. The difference between groups was not statistically significant (RR, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.40-1.55]) for maternal complications related to hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.<sup>1,38,40</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Reduced Prenatal Screening Visit Schedule</h4>\r\n<p>Three RCTs (n = 5203) in the UK and US evaluated a reduced prenatal visit schedule for pregnant persons considered to be at low risk for pregnancy complications. One trial assessed pregnancy risk and study eligibility in the first trimester and the other 2 trials included eligible individuals entering prenatal care by week 24 and week 26 of gestation.<sup>1,38,41-43</sup> The trials evaluated the effects of a reduced prenatal care schedule (6-9 visits) compared with a standard visit schedule (13-14 visits). The study population in the large US trial (n = 2328) of a reduced prenatal visit schedule was described as predominantly White (81%) and Hispanic (12%) individuals.<sup>1,38,41</sup> One-third of study participants (32%) were described as an &ldquo;ethnic minority&rdquo; in the large UK trial (n = 2794).<sup>1,38,42</sup> The small US-based RCT (n = 81) included primarily Hispanic (74%) and White (22%) study participants.<sup>1,38,43</sup></p>\r\n<p>Few cases of perinatal mortality were reported in the reduced visit intervention and routine visit control groups in the 2 large trials. Estimates of perinatal mortality were not statistically significant in the large US trial (RR, 1.00 [95% CI, 0.54-1.86]) or in the large UK trial (RR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.27-1.88]).<sup>1,38,41,42</sup> Estimates of preterm delivery (&lt;37 weeks of gestation) were not statistically significant in the 2 US trials (RR, 1.08 [96% CI, 0.92-1.27] and RR, 2.21 [96% CI, 0.45-10.70]).<sup>1,38,41,43</sup> In the large US trial, the risk of IUGR/SGA (&lt;10th percentile) was not statistically different between study groups (RR, 1.13 [95% CI, 0.91-1.41]).<sup>1,38,41</sup> The large UK trial also reported IUGR/SGA, with no statistically significant difference (RR, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.82-1.09]) observed between intervention and control groups.<sup>1,38,42</sup> The risk for low birth weight (&lt;2500 g) was reported in the large US trial and was similar between groups (RR, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.78-1.12]).<sup>1,38,41</sup> Other rare infant health outcomes were reported in the small US trial.<sup>1,38,43</sup> Placental abruption was reported in the large US trial, but the risk was not statistically significant (RR, 1.21 [95% CI, 0.90-1.64]).<sup>1,38,41</sup> The risk of postpartum hemorrhage was similar in the large UK and US trials (RR, 1.01 [95% CI, 0.80-1.26] and RR, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.59-1.50], respectively).<sup>1,38,41,42</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Indicated Rather Than Routine Urine Screening for Proteinuria</h4>\r\n<p>One fair-quality nonrandomized study (n = 2441) conducted in the US measured the effects of indicated (vs routine) urine screening in prenatal care.<sup>44</sup> Pregnant individuals receiving prenatal care before and after implementation of a change in clinical practice were compared. In a historical comparison group, prenatal care included routine urine screening at every visit, and in the intervention period, urine tests were conducted at the first prenatal visit and at subsequent visits for a range of indications (eg, urinary tract infection symptoms, severe vomiting or weight loss, or elevated blood pressure).<sup>44</sup> The study population identified as Black (9%), Hispanic (75%), White (19%), or &ldquo;other&rdquo; (6%), and the study was conducted in a setting with risks related to social determinants of health (eg, majority public insurance or uninsured or lower income). Indicated urine screening was associated with reduced risk of preterm delivery (4.9%) compared with more frequent routine urine screening (7.7%) (RR, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.45-0.90]).<sup>1,38,44</sup> The study was limited by potential confounding related to the design, and more research would be needed to confirm this result.</p>\r\n<h3>Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>Previous evidence reviews commissioned by the USPSTF found good-quality evidence that measuring blood pressure has few major harms in adults.<sup>41</sup> In the current review, there was limited evidence that the screening approaches for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy resulted in serious or significant harms.</p>\r\n<p>Five fair-quality RCTs and 1 fair-quality nonrandomized study of interventions with a historical control were included in the evaluation of harms.<sup>1,38,40-45</sup> An additional home blood pressure measurement screening trial (n = 80), conducted in the UK, enrolled study participants at low risk for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation.

In response to comments, the USPSTF clarified its definition of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. The USPSTF incorporated language in the Practice Considerations section regarding postpartum blood pressure monitoring and appropriate cuff sizes.

The USPSTF uses the reaffirmation process for well-established, evidence-based standards of practice in current primary care practice for which only a very high level of evidence would justify a change in the grade of the recommendation.<sup>9</sup> In its deliberation of the evidence, the USPSTF considers whether the new evidence is of sufficient strength and quality to change its previous conclusions about the evidence.</p><h2>Practice Considerations</h2><h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>\r\n<p>This recommendation statement applies to routine screening of adolescents and adults, including pregnant persons, without known history, signs, or symptoms of genital HSV infection. This recommendation statement does not apply to persons who present to clinicians requesting testing due to a history, signs, or symptoms suggestive of genital herpes or persons with HIV infection or other immunosuppressive disorders.</p>\r\n<h3>Definitions</h3>\r\n<p>In this recommendation statement, &ldquo;asymptomatic&rdquo; refers to persons without known past or current history of genital herpes and includes persons who may have unrecognized infection.<sup>1</sup> Persons who are known to have genital herpes and are between outbreak occurrences are not considered to be asymptomatic for this recommendation. &ldquo;Genital herpes&rdquo; refers to a range of signs and symptoms related to HSV infection in the sacral nerve area.<sup>1</sup> Many persons with genital herpes have intermittent, recurrent genital ulcers or vesicular lesions and may have local symptoms (eg, itching) or systemic signs (eg, fever).<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Treatment and Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>Treatment of persons with symptoms of genital herpes often includes antiviral medications to provide symptomatic relief from painful outbreaks, prevent HSV recurrences, prevent transmission to sexual partners, and improve quality of life.<sup>3,11</sup> In asymptomatic persons with serologic evidence of HSV, it is not clear whether antiviral treatment is warranted.<sup>3,11</sup> The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides detailed guidance for diagnosis and management of genital herpes, including counseling to prevent sexual and perinatal transmission.<sup>3,11</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Additional Tools and Resources</h3>\r\n<p>The following resources may assist clinicians in implementation of strategies to prevent STIs in the primary care setting.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The CDC provides information about behavioral counseling and other STI prevention strategies (<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/std/prevention\">https://www.cdc.gov/std/prevention</a>)<sup>12</sup> and maintains a compendium of evidence-based behavioral counseling interventions developed to prevent HIV transmission that have been shown to reduce STI acquisition and increase safer sexual behaviors (<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/research/interventionresearch/compendium/rr/complete.html\">https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/research/interventionresearch/compendium/rr/complete.html</a>).<sup>13</sup></li>\r\n<li>The CDC also provides a clinician pocket guide for treatment of genital herpes and other STIs (<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/std/products/provider-pocket-guides.htm\">https://www.cdc.gov/std/products/provider-pocket-guides.htm</a>),<sup>14</sup> treatment guidelines for genital herpes (<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment-guidelines/herpes.htm\">https://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment-guidelines/herpes.htm</a>),<sup>3</sup> and strategies to assist clinicians in discussing sexual health issues (<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/SexualHistory.htm\">https://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/SexualHistory.htm</a>).<sup>15</sup></li>\r\n<li>The Community Preventive Services Task Force has several recommendations on the prevention of HIV/AIDS, other STIs, and teen pregnancy (<a href=\"https://www.thecommunityguide.org/topic/hiv-stis-and-teen-pregnancy.html\">https://www.thecommunityguide.org/topic/hiv-stis-and-teen-pregnancy.html</a>).<sup>16</sup></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Other Related USPSTF Recommendations</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF has issued several related recommendations to prevent negative health outcomes related to STIs, including the following.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Behavioral counseling interventions to prevent STIs<sup>17</sup></li>\r\n<li>Screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea<sup>18</sup></li>\r\n<li>Screening for HIV infection<sup>19</sup></li>\r\n<li>Screening for syphilis infection in nonpregnant adolescents and adults<sup>20</sup></li>\r\n<li>Screening for syphilis infection in pregnant persons<sup>21</sup></li>\r\n</ul>","discussion":"<h2>Supporting Evidence</h2><h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n<p>To reaffirm its recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a reaffirmation evidence update.<sup>1,22</sup> The aim of the evidence update that supported the reaffirmation process was to identify new and substantial evidence that could be sufficient to change the prior recommendation.<sup>9</sup> The reaffirmation update focused on targeted key questions to systematically evaluate the evidence on accuracy, benefits, and harms of routine serologic screening for HSV-2 infection in asymptomatic adolescents, adults, and pregnant persons. Additionally, evidence was sought on the effectiveness and harms of preventive medications and behavioral counseling interventions in asymptomatic populations to reduce future symptomatic episodes and transmission to susceptible sexual partners and infants.</p>\r\n<p>The reaffirmation update that supports this recommendation found no new evidence since the 2016 review.<sup>1,22</sup> In 2016, the USPSTF reviewed 17 studies (n = 9736) in 19 publications.<sup>5,6</sup> The USPSTF reviewed evidence comparing accuracy of HerpeSelect (Focus Diagnostics) and the Biokit HSV-2 Rapid Test (American Screening LLC), 2 commercially available serologic tests approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, with the Western blot (the criterion standard).<sup>1,6</sup> HerpeSelect and the Biokit HSV-2 Rapid Test are based on detection of HSV-specific glycoprotein G2.<sup>1</sup> Serologic tests can detect antibodies to HSV infection typically 6 weeks to 3 months after infection.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no new studies assessing the accuracy of serologic screening for HSV-2 in asymptomatic adolescents, adults, and pregnant persons.<sup>1,22</sup> Based on previous evidence from the 2016 review of 11 studies (n = 7129),<sup>5</sup> accuracy estimates of HSV-2 serologic tests, which are largely derived from populations with higher prevalence of HSV-2 infection compared with the general US population, are of limited applicability to the general US primary care population.<sup>6</sup> Most studies enrolled populations with seropositivity greater than 40% for HSV-2 based on Western blot.<sup>6</sup> In 10 studies (n = 6537) using a cut point of 1.1, the HerpeSelect test had a pooled sensitivity estimate of 99% (95% CI, 97%-100%) and a pooled specificity estimate of 81% (95% CI, 68%-90%), compared with Western blot.<sup>6</sup> In 4 studies (n = 1512), the Biokit test had a pooled sensitivity estimate of 84% (95% CI, 73%-91%) and pooled specificity estimate of 95% (95% CI, 93%-97%), compared with Western blot.<sup>6</sup> Based on a previous review, in the US population, estimated positive predictive value for the Biokit test may be as low as 75% and as low as 50% for the HerpeSelect test for predicting true seropositivity. Estimated declines in HSV-2 seroprevalence in the US population (since the 2016 review) likely further limit test predictive value.<sup>1,7</sup> Confirmatory testing with the highly specific Western blot is not widely available, complicating population-wide screening in the US.<sup>1,6</sup> No studies have examined the screening accuracy of serologic tests for HSV-2 in pregnant persons.<sup>1,6</sup></p>\r\n<p>Studies report that many new cases of genital herpes may be caused by HSV-1; while HSV-1 infection can be identified by serologic tests, it is highly prevalent (&asymp;48%), and serologic tests cannot determine the site of infection (oral or anogenital) in persons who have not previously experienced symptoms.<sup>1,6</sup> Therefore, serologic tests are not useful for routine screening for asymptomatic genital herpes from HSV-1 infection.<sup>1,6</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Risk Assessment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no evidence of externally validated, reliable risk stratification tools to identify individuals more or less likely to have genital herpes.<sup>1,6</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no new studies evaluating effectiveness of antiviral medications to reduce genital HSV-2 viral shedding or effectiveness of antiviral medications or behavioral counseling interventions to reduce future symptomatic episodes or transmission of genital herpes in asymptomatic adolescents, adults, and pregnant persons.<sup>1,22</sup> Based on evidence in the 2016 evidence review, the USPSTF found limited and heterogenous evidence of benefit of early identification and early treatment of HSV-2 in asymptomatic adults, including pregnant persons.<sup>6,10</sup> Genital herpes has no cure; the role of antiviral medications in asymptomatic persons is unclear.<sup>1</sup> Pregnant persons with active genital lesions or prodromal symptoms can be managed with cesarean delivery to reduce the risk of neonatal transmission.<sup>1</sup> Given these findings, the USPSTF concluded that routine screening for HSV-2 in asymptomatic persons would confer no more than a small population benefit.</p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Screening and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no new studies reporting on the harms of screening for or treatment of genital herpes in asymptomatic adolescents, adults, and pregnant persons.<sup>1,22</sup> Based on previous evidence, the USPSTF estimated that using the widely available serologic tests for HSV-2, nearly 1 of every 2 diagnoses in the general US primary care population could be false.<sup>6</sup> A previous USPSTF review estimated that in a population of 10,000 persons with an HSV-2 prevalence of 15%, serologic screening could result in approximately 1585 true-positive and 1445 false-positive results.<sup>1</sup> At the current US estimated prevalence of 12%, true-positive results would likely further decrease and false-positive results would likely further increase.<sup>6</sup> Additionally, the USPSTF concluded that there may be potential social and emotional harms associated with a false-positive diagnosis6 and potential harms of unnecessary treatment with preventive antiviral medications in persons with a false-positive diagnosis.</p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from August 16, 2022, to September 12, 2022. The USPSTF reviewed and considered all comments received during this period. Comments expressed concern that genital HSV infection is minimized and not taken seriously. Others expressed concern that persons with asymptomatic genital herpes infection can unknowingly transmit the infection to sexual partners. The USPSTF understands these concerns and recognizes the importance of sexual health. Several comments supported the USPSTF's analysis and conclusions, noting that the recommendation is consistent with current clinical practice and guidelines from other organizations, including the CDC and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF strongly calls for additional research into high-quality, accurate screening tests and effective interventions to prevent negative health outcomes of genital HSV in asymptomatic adolescents, adults, and pregnant persons. The USPSTF has several positive recommendations related to screening for and counseling to prevent STIs.</p><h2>Research Needs and Gaps</h2><p>The USPSTF recognizes the importance of improving screening for and treatment of genital herpes to prevent future symptomatic episodes and transmission.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that spina bifida occurs in 3.9 of 10,000 live births in the US, anencephaly in 2.5 of 10,000 live births, and encephalocele in 1 of 10,000 live births.<sup>2</sup> Neural tube defects can result in death and a range of disabilities affecting children. Children with encephaloceles have an increased mortality rate, with many survivors having neurologic and developmental deficits.<sup>3-5</sup> Common disabilities from spina bifida include lower limb weakness and paralysis, sensory loss, bowel and bladder dysfunction, orthopedic abnormalities (eg, clubfoot, contractures, hip dislocation, scoliosis, or kyphosis), and ventriculomegaly (which may require placement of ventricular-peritoneal shunts).<sup>6-8</sup> Anencephaly is life-limiting in early infancy.<sup>9</sup></p>\r\n<p>Folate refers to vitamin B<sub>9</sub>, a water-soluble B vitamin that occurs in many chemical forms, including naturally in foods such as leafy greens, fruits, nuts, beans, peas, seafood, eggs, dairy products, meat, and poultry.<sup>10</sup> Folic acid is the term applied to the synthetic form of folate that is found in supplements and added to fortified foods. Folic acid supplementation for persons in the periconceptional period has been found to reduce the risk of neural tube defects in offspring.<sup>11,12</sup> Despite folic acid fortification of food and supplementation guidelines, folic acid deficiency remains a concern in the US. Low levels of maternal folate may be due to inadequate dietary intake, poor intestinal absorption, medication use that interferes with folic acid function, and impaired folate metabolism.<sup>10</sup> Survey data from 1998 to 2016 found that approximately 20% to 40% of women who were recently pregnant or trying to get pregnant reported taking periconceptional folic acid supplements, and those with an unintended pregnancy were 4 to 5 times less likely to have taken periconceptional folic acid supplements.<sup>10</sup></p><h2>USPSTF Assessment of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h2><p>In 2017, the USPSTF reviewed the evidence for folic acid supplementation and issued an A recommendation.<sup>12</sup> The USPSTF has decided to use a reaffirmation deliberation process to update this recommendation.

It does not apply to persons who have had a previous pregnancy affected by neural tube defects or who are at very high risk because of other factors (eg, use of certain antiseizure medications or family history). It does not apply to persons taking certain medications known to block the function of folic acid (eg, methotrexate, carbamazepine, and valproic acid).</p>\r\n<h3>Definitions</h3>\r\n<p>Neural tube defects are caused by a failure of closure of the embryonic neural tube, which results in birth defects of the brain, spinal cord, and overlying tissues. The most common forms of neural tube defects are anencephaly, encephalocele, and spina bifida.<sup>14</sup> Anencephaly occurs when the cranial portion of the neural tube fails to close. Affected infants are born without portions of the brain and skull. Anencephaly is life-limiting in early infancy. Encephalocele occurs when cranial defects allow portions of the brain and meninges to protrude. Spina bifida is a group of conditions that vary in severity and include myelomeningocele (protrusion of the spinal cord and meninges through a spinal defect), meningocele (protrusion of meninges through a spinal defect), and spina bifida occulta (spinal defect without any protrusion).<sup>10</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>\r\n<p>All pregnancies are at risk for neural tube defects, and persons who are planning to or could become pregnant should take folic acid supplements. Certain risk factors convey a higher risk, and individuals with these risk factors should talk to their health care professional. These factors include personal, partner, or family history of neural tube defects, malabsorption caused by bariatric procedures, the use of certain antiseizure medicines, and genetic mutations in folate-related enzymes.<sup>15-19</sup> Pregestational diabetes and obesity have been associated with an increased risk of neural tube defects.<sup>20,21</sup> Ethnic groups such as First Nation persons in Canada and Hispanic persons in California are thought to be at higher risk of neural tube defects.<sup>22,23</sup> It is unclear, however, whether this is related to a higher risk of genetic variations among these groups or due to differential intake of folic acid&ndash;fortified foods.<sup>10</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Timing</h3>\r\n<p>The neural plate completes its formation and closure early in pregnancy (usually 26 to 28 days after fertilization).<sup>17</sup> This means the critical period for folic acid supplementation starts at least 1 month before conception and continues through the first 2 to 3 months of pregnancy. Nearly half of all pregnancies in the US are unplanned; to gain the full benefits of supplementation, clinicians should advise all persons who plan to or who could become pregnant to take daily folic acid.<sup>24</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Dosage</h3>\r\n<p>Good evidence from studies in settings without fortification of food suggests that an over-the-counter multivitamin with between 0.4 mg (400 &mu;g) (the generally available dose) and 0.8 mg (800 &mu;g) of folic acid daily reduces the risk for neural tube defects.<sup>10,12</sup> Clinical practice guidelines from professional medical and public health organizations recommend a minimum folic acid supplemental daily intake of 400 &mu;g for all persons who are planning a pregnancy or could become pregnant.<sup>25-28</sup></p>\r\n<p>Since 1998, specific enriched cereal grain products in the US have been fortified with folic acid. In 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration began allowing corn masa flour to be voluntarily fortified with folic acid.<sup>10</sup> Evidence shows that persons who may become pregnant are not consuming fortified foods at a quantity to provide optimal benefit for prevention of neural tube defects.<sup>12,29</sup> Therefore, all persons planning to or who could become pregnant should take a daily supplement of at least 400 ug.</p>\r\n<h3>Additional Tools and Resources</h3>\r\n<p>The Community Preventive Services Task Force recommends community-wide education campaigns to promote the use of folic acid supplements among persons of childbearing age (<a href=\"https://www.thecommunityguide.org/findings/pregnancy-health-community-wide-campaigns-promote-use-folic-acid-supplements.html\">https://www.thecommunityguide.org/findings/pregnancy-health-community-wide-campaigns-promote-use-folic-acid-supplements.html</a>).</p><h2>Reaffirmation of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h2><p>This recommendation is a reaffirmation of the USPSTF 2017 recommendation statement. In 2017, the USPSTF reviewed the evidence for folic acid supplementation to prevent neural tube defects and found convincing evidence that the benefits of supplementation substantially outweighed the harms (A recommendation).<sup>12</sup> In the current update, the USPSTF found no new substantial evidence that could change its recommendation and, therefore, reaffirms its recommendation that all persons planning to or who could become pregnant take a daily supplement of folic acid.</p>","other":"<h2>Supporting Evidence</h2><h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n<p>To reaffirm its recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a reaffirmation evidence update.<sup>10,30</sup> The aim of evidence updates that support the reaffirmation process is to identify new and substantial evidence sufficient to change the prior recommendation.<sup>13</sup> The reaffirmation update focuses on targeted key questions on the benefits and harms of folic acid supplementation.</p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Folic Acid Supplementation</h3>\r\n<p>In 2017, the USPSTF reviewed the evidence on the benefits of folic acid supplementation to prevent neural tube defects and found convincing evidence that the benefits of supplementation were significant. Three fair-quality observational studies (reported in 4 publications) published since the last USPSTF recommendation reported on the association between folic acid supplementation and neural tube defects (n = 990,372).<sup>10,30</sup> Two cohort studies were in populations without food fortification (Norway and Japan) and the third was a case-control study set in the US and Canada prior to and after the introduction of food fortification.<sup>10,30</sup> The Norwegian cohort study (n = 896,674 live births and stillborn infants) reported results by time periods (1999-2005, 2006-2013, and overall, 1999-2013).<sup>31,32</sup> In Norway, folic acid supplementation was first recommended in 1999 and folic acid was not included in most multivitamins until 2004. The authors hypothesized that the study periods corresponded to lesser (1999-2005) and greater (2006-2013) adherence to recommendations regarding folic acid supplementation. The study reported a statistically significant reduction in neural tube defects in women taking folic acid supplementation in the period corresponding to greater adherence (2006 to 2013) but not in other periods. The Japanese cohort (n = 92,269) compared adequate users of folic acid supplements (started before conception) with inadequate users (started after pregnancy recognition or nonuse of folic acid supplements). Neural tube defect outcomes included spina bifida, anencephaly, and encephalocele. The study reported no statistically significant differences associated with folic acid supplementation.<sup>33</sup> Both cohort studies drew from general populations. The case-control study set in the US and Canada in the period following food fortification focused on high-risk participants. A subgroup of participants (123 cases and 1306 controls) with pregestational diabetes and prepregnancy obesity was included in the review. This study reported no statistically significant associations between daily or less than daily folic acid supplementation, compared with no supplementation, and neural tube defects.<sup>34</sup></p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF also reviewed data on whether the benefits of folic acid supplementation differ by timing. In the previously mentioned Norwegian study, there was no effect of folic acid supplementation regardless of the timing of folic acid supplementation in the period corresponding to lesser adherence (1999-2005) and in the overall period (1999-2013). In the second period (2006-2013), the results demonstrated a benefit of folic acid supplementation regardless of timing (before pregnancy only: adjusted relative risk [aRR], 0.54 [95% CI, 0.31-0.91]; before and during pregnancy: aRR, 0.49 [95% CI, 0.29-0.83]; and during pregnancy only: aRR, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.39-0.97]).<sup>10,30</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Folic Acid Supplementation</h3>\r\n<p>In 2017, the USPSTF reviewed the evidence on the harms of folic acid supplementation to prevent neural tube defects and found adequate evidence that folic acid supplementation at usual doses is not associated with serious harms. Six fair-quality cohort studies and 1 fair-quality case-control study published since the 2017 USPSTF recommendation examined the potential association between folic acid supplementation and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (n = 761,125).<sup>10,30</sup> No study reported statistically significant associations between supplementation and increased risk of ASD. Two studies reported statistically significant reductions of autism associated with folic acid supplementation. Other studies in similar geographic settings or populations that used different measures of exposure or comparators reported no association between folic acid supplementation and autism. Three studies reported on associations between folic acid supplementation and ASD by dose and found no differences. Two studies reported on associations between folic acid supplementation and ASD by timing. Neither reported harms; however, 1 study reported a statistically significant reduction of ASD associated with folic acid supplementation initiation in weeks 5 to 8 of the pregnancy.<sup>10,30</sup></p>\r\n<p>One high-quality trial reported on the differences in twin deliveries based on the dose of folic acid. It found no differences between an exposure of 4 mg vs 0.4 mg of folic acid daily. No studies reported on the overall risk, timing, or duration of twin gestations and folic acid supplementation.<sup>10,30</sup> One cohort study (n = 429,004) found no association between folic acid supplementation and maternal cancer.<sup>10,30</sup></p>\r\n<h3>How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?</h3>\r\n<p>Adequate maternal folate levels are important in preventing neural tube defects; however, the mechanism by which folate reduces this risk is not well understood. Folate is necessary for nucleotide synthesis and DNA and RNA function.<sup>10</sup> Inadequate folate levels impair nucleotide synthesis and DNA and RNA replication and may lead to incomplete neural folds and subsequent neural tube defects.</p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from February 21, 2023, to March 20, 2023. Most comments agreed with the conclusions of the USPSTF. Commenters requested additional information on the dosage of folic acid. The USPSTF wishes to clarify that the generally available dosage for folic acid supplementation is between 0.4 and 0.8 mg daily. The most common dosages from the included studies were in this range. Women at higher risk of neural tube defects may require dosages above this range and should speak with their clinician about this. Based on comments, the USPSTF also included information on naturally occurring sources of folate.</p><h2>Research Needs and Gaps</h2><p>Studies are needed that provide more information on the following.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>More research is needed to better understand how genetic variants such as <em>MTHFR</em> slow folate metabolism and how these variants affect strategies for folic acid supplementation.</li>\r\n<li>More research is needed on the effectiveness of folic acid supplementation in reducing neural tube defects among those disproportionately affected by the condition, including Hispanic persons.</li>\r\n<li>More research is needed on factors that contribute to variations in adherence to supplementation.</li>\r\n</ul><h2>Recommendations of Others</h2><p>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, American Academy of Family Physicians, and American Academy of Pediatrics all recommend folic acid supplementation of 400 &mu;g (0.4 mg) per day for persons of reproductive age who are planning to become pregnant and are at average risk of neural tube defects (ie, without a prior pregnancy with a neural tube defect).<sup>25-27</sup></p>","topic":"Folic Acid Supplementation to Prevent Neural Tube Defects: Preventive Medication","keywords":"folic acid|pregnancy|Neural Tube Defects|folate","pubDate":"2023-08-01","categories":["1","9","2"],"tool":["510","513","512","511"]},"799":{"topicType":"Screening","topicYear":2025,"uspstfAlias":"osteoporosis-screening","specific":[2058,2057,2059],"title":"Osteoporosis to Prevent Fractures: Screening","pathwayToBenefit":"To achieve the benefit of screening to reduce morbidity and mortality from fractures, women found to have osteoporosis should be further evaluated, counseled, and, if appropriate, prescribed evidence-based management.","rationale":"<h2>Importance</h2><p>Osteoporosis is a skeletal disorder characterized by decreased bone mass leading to increased bone fragility and fracture risk.

It does not apply to persons with secondary osteoporosis due to an underlying medical condition (eg, cancer, metabolic bone diseases, or hyperthyroidism) or chronic use of a medication (eg, glucocorticoids) associated with bone loss.</p>\r\n<p>In this recommendation statement, the recommendations are stratified by &ldquo;men&rdquo; and &ldquo;women,&rdquo; although the net benefit estimates are driven by sex as assigned at birth (ie, male/female) rather than gender identity. In describing the evidence, sex terms are reported as used by study authors, which are typically &ldquo;men&rdquo; and &ldquo;women.&rdquo; Transgender men and transgender women who have not undergone any hormonal treatment associated with transitioning likely have the same risks as persons assigned female and male sex at birth; however, they should consult with their clinician to determine which recommendation best applies to them.</p>\r\n<h3>Definitions</h3>\r\n<p>In 1994, the World Health Organization defined osteoporosis in postmenopausal White women as bone density at the hip or lumbar spine that is 2.5 standard deviations or lower (T score &le;&ndash;2.5) than the mean bone mineral density (BMD) measured at that site for a reference population of young healthy White women.<sup>6</sup> This ultimately became the reference standard for persons of all racial and ethnic groups, and for males and females.<sup>7</sup></p>\r\n<p>Fragility fractures (also known as &ldquo;low-energy&rdquo; or &ldquo;low-trauma&rdquo; fractures) are fractures sustained from a fall from standing height or lower that would not cause a fracture in most healthy persons.<sup>8</sup></p>\r\n<p>Major osteoporotic fracture (MOF) is defined as a fracture of the hip, spine, wrist, or shoulder.</p>\r\n<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>\r\n<p>Although bone density is an important risk factor for fragility fractures, advancing age is a stronger determinant.<sup>9</sup> Older adults have much higher fracture rates than younger adults with the same BMD because of concurrent increasing risk from declining bone quality and an increasing risk of falling.<sup>10</sup></p>\r\n<p>When deciding which postmenopausal women younger than 65 years to screen, the USPSTF suggests a 2-step approach. Clinicians can first determine the presence of risk factors for osteoporosis and fracture. These include menopausal status, low body weight, parental history of hip fracture, cigarette smoking, and excess alcohol consumption.<sup>11,12</sup> For postmenopausal women younger than 65 years with 1 or more risk factors (in addition to postmenopausal status), the USPSTF then recommends using a clinical risk assessment tool (ie, a tool designed to identify osteoporosis or predict fracture risk) to estimate risk and help decide whether screening is warranted. More details about risk assessment tools and increased risk are provided in the Screening Tests and Screening Strategies section.</p>\r\n<p>Other medical conditions and medications (eg, corticosteroids or diabetes treated with insulin) may also increase risk of osteoporosis and, subsequently, fragility fractures. The prevalence of osteoporosis and incidence of osteoporotic fractures differs among racial and ethnic groups. Studies show lower fracture incidence in Asian, Black, and Hispanic populations compared with White populations among both men and women.<sup>13,14</sup> Differences in BMD alone are not sufficient to explain racial and ethnic differences in fracture incidence. For example, Asian women have been found to have lower BMD than White women but lower fracture risk.<sup>15-17</sup> Although the underlying causes for the differences in fracture incidence among racial and ethnic groups remain uncertain, they are likely due in part to social and environmental factors or differences in clinical risks.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Screening Tests and Screening Strategies</h3>\r\n<p>The most commonly used bone measurement test to screen for osteoporosis is dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at a central site (eg, total hip, femoral neck, or lumbar spine). Centrally measured DXA correlates with bone strength and clinical fracture outcomes and uses low doses of radiation.<sup>18</sup> Fracture risk at a specific site is best predicted if bone density is measured at that site.<sup>19</sup></p>\r\n<p>Some evidence suggests that BMD alone may not be the most useful predictor of fracture risk, especially in younger populations.<sup>20</sup> Several risk assessment tools that incorporate age and sex, with or without other risk factors, have been developed to either identify probability of osteoporosis or predict fracture risk. It is important to note that some of the risk assessment tools were developed on small cohorts of homogeneous populations or have limited published evidence.</p>\r\n<p>Risk assessment tools designed to estimate future fracture risk that can be used with or without BMD as a risk factor input include FRAX,<sup>8</sup> the Fracture Risk Calculator (FRC),<sup>21</sup> and the Garvan Fracture Risk Calculator.<sup>22,23</sup> Of note, the predictive accuracy of these tools often improves when BMD is included in the risk assessment calculation.<sup>1</sup> Risk assessment tools designed to identify osteoporosis (eg, the Osteoporosis Risk Assessment Instrument [ORAI] and the Osteoporosis Self-assessment Tool [OST]) generally require fewer risk inputs than tools designed to predict fracture risk.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<p>FRAX is the most studied fracture risk assessment tool. Country-specific versions of FRAX are available that have been calibrated using country-specific fracture incidence and mortality data, which are part of the FRAX risk calculation.<sup>24</sup> As of 2016, FRAX was incorporated into 120 guidelines worldwide and added into DXA software following regulatory approval by the US Food and Drug Administration and has been incorporated into clinical decision support tools within electronic health record systems.<sup>25</sup> FRAX predicts the 10-year probability of hip fracture or MOF for persons aged 40 to 90 years by using demographic and clinical factors alone or in combination with BMD measured at the femoral neck.<sup>24,26</sup> Risks predicted by FRAX alone and by BMD alone are similar, but both are less accurate than risks predicted by FRAX plus BMD.<sup>27</sup> In the US, 4 different versions of FRAX calibrated using racial- and ethnic-specific fracture incidence data are available, including unique versions for Hispanic, non-Hispanic Asian, non-Hispanic Black, and non-Hispanic White persons.<sup>25</sup> Concerns exist regarding the validity of race-specific FRAX calculators. Because hip fracture incidence in the US is lower in most non-White racial and ethnic groups, predicted fracture risk estimates for Asian, Black, and Hispanic persons will always be lower than for White persons of the same age, sex, weight, BMD, and clinical risk factors in the FRAX model,<sup>28,29</sup> which could lead to racial and ethnic differences in who is offered treatment among persons of otherwise identical age, BMD, and clinical risk profile. It is also unclear which version of FRAX to use for persons who are multiracial, or immigrants from other countries who are now living in the US.<sup>30</sup> Other limitations of the FRAX instrument include use of binary exposure to glucocorticoids and alcohol use (yes/no vs quantified dose exposure), lack of use of lumbar spine BMD or trabecular bone score, lack of information collected about history of falls or frailty, use of cohort studies that are 30 to 40 years old to estimate race-specific fracture incidence, use of mortality estimates that have not been updated since 2004, and lack of inclusion of medical conditions such as diabetes that may portend an increased risk.<sup>25,31,32</sup></p>\r\n<p>Screening for osteoporosis to prevent fractures consists of a central DXA BMD, with or without fracture risk assessment. Because most fragility fractures occur in persons without osteoporosis (ie, with DXA T scores &gt;-2.5), some screening strategies focus on identifying those at risk for fracture and not just those with osteoporosis.<sup>25</sup> Results from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are now available that evaluated screening strategies using some combination of the FRAX risk calculation and BMD; no published studies have been designed to evaluate a treatment strategy based on fracture risk (ie, FRAX) alone. Centrally measured DXA was the test used to determine eligibility for participants enrolled in nearly all trials of bone-conserving pharmacotherapies.<sup>1</sup> Thus, screening can entail DXA with or without fracture risk assessment.</p>\r\n<p>Similarly, approaches to determining whom to screen among postmenopausal women younger than 65 years who have 1 or more risk factors (ie, determining who is at increased risk) could reasonably focus on assessment of fracture risk or risk of osteoporosis, using 1 of several risk assessment tools. <a href=\"#tab2\">Table 2</a> includes examples of risk assessment tools that have been reported to have reasonable accuracy for identifying osteoporosis (OST or ORAI) or predicting hip fracture (FRAX) in women younger than 65 years.<sup>1</sup> The risk assessment tools for identifying osteoporosis (OST or ORAI)<sup>34,35</sup> have commonly used thresholds for defining increased risk at which further screening with DXA is suggested (<a href=\"#tab2\">Table 2</a>). For FRAX, there is no such threshold defined with respect to its use in screening. However, to provide context, a 65-year-old White female with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by square of height in meters) and no risk factors has a 10-year risk of hip fracture of 1.3% and a 10-year risk of MOF of 9.3% based on FRAX without BMD input. The USPSTF does not intend that these 10-year risk levels (in the example given) be used as mechanistic thresholds for determining who should receive further screening with DXA. Rather, it is suggested that the results of risk assessment be used to help inform decisions about further screening with DXA.</p>\r\n<h3>Screening Intervals</h3>\r\n<p>Cohort studies evaluating screening intervals suggest that repeating BMD testing at an interval of 4 to 8 years does not result in additional accuracy in predicting fractures.<sup>1</sup> Other studies attempted to identify appropriate screening intervals based on the time in which it takes individuals to transition to osteoporosis or a certain fracture risk threshold. The screening intervals varied across studies, but generally, transition to osteoporosis occurred over shorter intervals for individuals with lower baseline T scores and older age (eg, almost 17 years for 10% of women with normal BMD at baseline to develop osteoporosis vs about 5 years for women with a baseline T score in the &minus;1.50 to &minus;1.99 range).<sup>36</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The US Food and Drug Administration has approved several drug therapies for the treatment or prevention of osteoporosis, including bisphosphonates, denosumab, romosozumab, parathyroid hormone, raloxifene, calcitonin, and estrogen (with or without progesterone).</p>\r\n<p>Clinicians should be aware that treatment recommendations that are based on risk assessment tools with race-specific calculators (eg, FRAX) but that use fixed fracture risk treatment thresholds not specific to race and ethnicity may be less likely to identify Asian, Black, and Hispanic persons as high risk and, subsequently, may be less likely to offer treatment compared with White persons of the same age, BMD, and clinical risk profile. Similarly, prediction models that do not include conditions that are associated with increased fracture risk and that disproportionately affect certain racial and ethnic groups (eg, diabetes) may result in biased underestimates of risk. For these reasons, it may be reasonable to avoid strict application of risk assessment tool treatment thresholds at the individual level to account for additional risks (eg, fall risk) not considered in risk assessment tools like FRAX.<sup>37,38</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>\r\n<p>When deciding whether to screen for osteoporosis to prevent osteoporotic fractures in men, clinicians should consider the following factors.</p>\r\n<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>\r\n<p>Based on National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data from 2017 to 2018, age-adjusted prevalence of osteoporosis is 12.6% among US residents 50 years or older. Prevalence is higher in women (19.6%) compared with men (4.4%) and among persons 65 years or older (27.1% in women and 5.7% in men) compared with persons aged 50 to 64 years (13.1% in women and 3.3% in men).<sup>3</sup></p>\r\n<p>Morbidity and mortality resulting from a fragility fracture are the primary concerns from having osteoporosis. Based on Medicare data, approximately 1.8 million beneficiaries experienced a new osteoporotic fracture in 2016.<sup>39</sup> Although osteoporosis and fragility fractures are more common in women than men, excess mortality related to osteoporosis and fragility fractures is greater in men.<sup>40,41</sup></p>\r\n<p>Men have similar risk factors associated with fragility fractures as women, including increasing age, low BMI, excessive alcohol intake, current smoking, chronic corticosteroid use, history of prior fractures, history of falls within the past year, hypogonadism, history of cerebrovascular accident, and history of diabetes.<sup>42</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Potential Harms</h4>\r\n<p>Potential harms of screening in men may be similar to those in women. Evidence on harms of drug therapies in men is limited.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Current Practice</h4>\r\n<p>Data on how frequently men are screened for osteoporosis are limited. Guidelines developed by various organizations and specialty societies vary. Some organizations recommend screening for osteoporosis in men older than 70 years. Other organizations do not specify for or against screening in men or recommend against it.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Additional Tools and Resources</h3>\r\n<p>The National Institutes of Health has information on osteoporosis (<a href=\"https://www.niams.nih.gov/health-topics/osteoporosis\">https://www.niams.nih.gov/health-topics/osteoporosis</a>, <a href=\"https://www.niams.nih.gov/health-topics/osteoporosis/diagnosis-treatment-and-steps-to-take\">https://www.niams.nih.gov/health-topics/osteoporosis/diagnosis-treatment-and-steps-to-take</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/osteoporosis/osteoporosis\">https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/osteoporosis/osteoporosis</a>).</p>\r\n<h3>Other Related USPSTF Recommendations</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF recommends exercise interventions to prevent falls in community-dwelling adults 65 years or older at increased risk of falls and selectively offering multifactorial interventions based on circumstances of prior falls, presence of comorbid medical conditions, and the patient&rsquo;s values and preferences.<sup>43</sup> In its 2018 recommendation statement, the USPSTF recommended against supplementation with 400 IU or less of vitamin D and 1000 mg or less of calcium in postmenopausal women to prevent fractures. The USPSTF found insufficient evidence on supplementation with higher doses of vitamin D and calcium, alone or combined, to prevent fractures in postmenopausal women, or at any dose in men and premenopausal women.<sup>44</sup> This recommendation is in the process of being updated; in the current draft recommendation, the USPSTF recommends against supplementation with vitamin D with or without calcium for the primary prevention of fractures in community-dwelling postmenopausal women and men 60 years or older, and against supplementation with vitamin D for the prevention of falls in community-dwelling postmenopausal women and men 60 years or older.</p><h2>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h2><p>This recommendation updates the 2018 USPSTF recommendation on screening for osteoporosis. In 2018, the USPSTF recommended screening for osteoporosis with bone measurement testing to prevent osteoporotic fractures in women 65 years or older and in postmenopausal women younger than 65 years who are at increased risk of osteoporosis, as determined by a formal clinical risk assessment tool.<sup>45</sup> For the current recommendation, the USPSTF has noted that screening can include DXA BMD, with or without fracture risk assessment. The current recommendation is otherwise generally consistent with the 2018 recommendation.</p>","other":"<h2>Supporting Evidence</h2><h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF commissioned a systematic review to evaluate the benefits and harms of screening for osteoporosis to prevent fractures in adults 40 years or older with no known diagnosis of osteoporosis or history of fragility fracture.<sup>1,46</sup> This review presents data to update the USPSTF&rsquo;s 2018 recommendation. The previous recommendation evaluated multiple imaging modalities (eg, peripheral DXA and quantitative ultrasound); however, this review only reports evidence for central DXA&mdash;the bone measurement test most commonly used to screen for osteoporosis.</p>\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening Tests and Risk Assessment</h3>\r\n<h4>BMD</h4>\r\n<p>Central DXA measures BMD at central bone sites (hip and lumbar spine) and is the established standard for the diagnosis of osteoporosis. Additionally, centrally measured DXA was the test used for determining T scores and determining eligibility among participants enrolled in nearly all trials of bone-conserving pharmacotherapies. Still, given that screening trials enrolled participants based on fracture risk, and that the goal of treating osteoporosis is to prevent fracture, the USPSTF reviewed studies that reported on the accuracy of centrally measured BMD for predicting fracture. The USPSTF found 13 unique cohorts that reported on the discrimination of BMD alone (as a continuous variable) for predicting MOF. These studies reported areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) ranging from 0.60 to 0.80. Twelve cohorts reported AUCs for predicting hip fracture; they were somewhat more accurate than MOF outcomes, with AUCs ranging from 0.64 to 0.86.<sup>1,46</sup></p>\r\n<p>Fewer studies reported on the predictive accuracy of BMD in women younger than 65 years. One study of women aged 45 to 54 years in the United Kingdom reported an AUC for predictive accuracy of BMD at the femoral neck of 0.64 (95% CI, 0.63-0.66) over a follow-up of 3 to 12 years.<sup>47</sup> One retrospective study exclusively in men 65 years or older reported an AUC for BMD over a follow-up of 15.8 years of 0.76 (95% CI, 0.71-0.80) for the prediction of MOF and 0.76 (95% CI, 0.72-0.81) for the prediction of hip fracture.<sup>48</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Risk Assessment Instruments to Identify Osteoporosis</h3>\r\n<p>Forty-three unique cohorts reported on diagnostic accuracy of 15 risk assessment instruments for identifying osteoporosis. More than one-half of the cohorts included populations with a mean age between 60 and 69 years, and included women, men, or both. In women, AUCs ranged from 0.32 to 0.87 across 35 reports evaluating 11 instruments. In men, AUCs ranged from 0.62 to 0.94 across 18 reports evaluating 12 instruments.<sup>1,46</sup></p>\r\n<p>The most studied instruments were FRAX, OST, ORAI, and Simple Calculated Osteoporosis Risk Estimation (SCORE). For cohorts reporting AUCs based on FRAX MOF risk, the AUCs ranged from 0.55 to 0.79, and for cohorts based on FRAX hip fracture risk, AUCs ranged from 0.70 to 0.86, across both sexes. For OST, the reported AUCs for women across 14 cohorts ranged from 0.64 to 0.81. Six cohorts reported an AUC for OST of 0.63 to 0.83 in women younger than 65 years. For ORAI, the reported AUCs for women across 19 cohorts (excluding 1 outlier) ranged from 0.32 to 0.84. Five cohorts reported results in women younger than 65 years, and the AUCs ranged from 0.60 to 0.84. For SCORE, AUCs for women across 16 studies ranged from 0.58 to 0.87 (excluding 1 outlier). For all instruments evaluated, variation in AUC was partly attributable to different risk or score thresholds used to evaluate accuracy across cohorts.<sup>1,46</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Risk Assessment Instruments to Predict Fracture</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found 6 systematic reviews and 16 cohorts that reported on the accuracy of 11 risk assessment models (EPIC [Escala de Predicci&oacute;n de fracturas Implementable en historia Cl&iacute;nica electronica], FRAX, FRC, FREM [Fracture Risk Evaluation Model], Garvan, ORAI, OSIRIS [Osteoporosis Index of Risk], OST, QFracture, SCORE, and the Women&rsquo;s Health Initiative Prediction Model) to predict MOF, hip fracture, or both using primarily AUC. Findings were heterogeneous, spanning a range of AUCs from 0.52 to 0.93; however, most were between 0.60 and 0.80. For risk assessment instruments with the option to include BMD as an input (FRAX, FRC, and Garvan), the predictive accuracy often improved when BMD was included compared with when it was not included. Further, some instruments (FRAX, FRC, Garvan, and QFracture) had better accuracy for predicting hip fracture than for predicting MOF.<sup>1,46</sup> For example, in 3 systematic reviews reviewed by the USPSTF, the AUCs for 10-year risk of MOF for FRAX in women ranged from 0.65 to 0.67 without BMD and from 0.67 to 0.71 when BMD was included, and the AUCs for 10-year risk of hip fracture for FRAX in women ranged from 0.74 to 0.77 without BMD and ranged from 0.76 to 0.79 when BMD was included.<sup>49-51</sup></p>\r\n<p>For studies reporting outcomes specifically for women younger than 65 years, reported AUCs ranged from 0.52 to 0.71 across instruments. For example, for FRAX without BMD, the AUCs for 10-year risk of MOF ranged from 0.56 to 0.59 across 3 studies,<sup>52-54</sup> and the AUCs for 10-year risk of hip fracture were 0.65 and 0.68 in 2 analyses reported in 1 study.<sup>53</sup> For studies reporting outcomes for men, the AUCs ranged from 0.63 to 0.93.<sup>1,46</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found 3 RCTs that reported on the effects of screening on clinical fracture outcomes: the Screening in the Community to Reduce Fractures in Older Women (SCOOP) study (n = 12,483 randomized),<sup>55</sup> the Risk-stratified Osteoporosis Strategy Evaluation (ROSE) study (n = 34,229 randomized population; n = 18,605 [per&ndash;protocol-1 analysis population]),<sup>56</sup> and the Stichting Artsen Laboratorium en Trombosedienst Osteoporosis Study (SOS) (n = 11,032 randomized).<sup>57</sup> All 3 RCTs included older European women (median age, 71 to 76 years); racial or ethnic characteristics were not reported in 2 of the 3 trials. The USPSTF found no studies that included men. Two RCTs (SCOOP and ROSE) used a 2-step screening intervention consisting of a FRAX risk assessment (without BMD input) on participants assigned to screening and then invited those with a high fracture risk score (&ge;15% risk for MOF in ROSE; at or above the age-based hip fracture risk threshold in SCOOP) for DXA. The mean or median 10-year FRAX-estimated risk of MOF was 19% in SCOOP, 20% in ROSE, and 24.6% in SOS; the respective 10-year estimated hip fracture risks were 8.5%, 6.7%, and 11.6%.<sup>55-57</sup> Test results and treatment recommendations were shared with participants&rsquo; primary care physicians, who made final decisions about treatment; the comparison group in all 3 studies was routine care. A pooled analysis of these studies found a statistically significant reduction in hip fractures and MOF. The pooled relative risk (RR) for the effect of screening on hip fractures was 0.83 (95% CI, 0.73-0.93; 3 RCTs; 42,009 participants), and the pooled RR for MOF was 0.94 (95% CI, 0.88-0.99; 3 RCTs; 42,009 participants). This corresponded to an absolute risk difference (ARD) of 5 fewer hip fractures (95% CI, 7 to 2 fewer) and 6 fewer MOFs (95% CI, 12 to 1 fewer) per 1000 participants over 3.7 to 5 years.<sup>1,46</sup></p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF also reviewed evidence on the benefits of treating low bone density. Twenty-one RCTs compared bisphosphonates with placebo. Most used T-score thresholds as a criterion to enroll participants, and 6 of the 21 trials required T scores in the osteoporotic range. Most trials were conducted among postmenopausal women, 1 trial was conducted in men, and 3 trials included a very small proportion of men. The mean age across trials ranged from 53 to 72 years. Studies reported clinical fractures (eg, hip, wrist, vertebral, and other sites), radiographic vertebral fractures, or both.</p>\r\n<p>The effect of bisphosphonates on vertebral fracture outcomes was reported in 10 trials. Five trials compared alendronate with placebo, 2 compared risedronate with placebo, and 3 compared zoledronic acid with placebo. The pooled RR was 0.51 (95% CI, 0.39-0.66; 10 RCTs; 9015 participants), corresponding to an ARD of 18 fewer vertebral fractures per 1000 participants treated (95% CI, 23 to 13 fewer).<sup>1</sup> The effect of bisphosphonates on hip fracture was reported in 6 trials. Three studies compared alendronate with placebo, 2 compared risedronate with placebo, and 1 compared zoledronic acid with placebo. The pooled RR was 0.67 (95% CI, 0.45-1.00; 6 trials; 12,055 participants), corresponding to an ARD of 3 fewer hip fractures per 1000 participants (95% CI, 5 to 0 fewer).<sup>1,46</sup></p>\r\n<p>One trial reported on the effectiveness of zoledronic acid in 1199 men with mean femoral neck T scores of &minus;2.2. It found a reduced risk of morphometric vertebral fractures in the treatment group (1.5% vs 4.6%; RR, 0.33 [95% CI, 0.16-0.70]) but no significant difference in nonvertebral fractures (0.9% vs 1.3%; RR, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.21-1.97]).<sup>58</sup></p>\r\n<p>Only 1 trial (the FREEDOM [Fracture Reduction Evaluation of Denosumab in Osteoporosis Every 6 Months] trial; n = 7808) was powered to look at the effect of denosumab on fracture outcomes. It reported a statistically significant decrease in incident radiographic vertebral fractures (2.3% vs 7.2%; RR, 0.32 [95% CI, 0.26-0.41]), incident clinical vertebral fractures (0.8% vs 2.5%; RR, 0.31 [95% CI, 0.20-0.47]), nonvertebral fractures (6.1% vs 7.5%; RR, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.67-0.95]), and hip fractures (0.7% vs 1.1%; RR, 0.60 [95% CI, 0.37-0.97]) in women randomized to denosumab.<sup>59</sup> One small study (n = 242) investigated the effects of denosumab on BMD in men but was not powered to look at fracture outcomes.<sup>60</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Screening and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>Evidence on the harms of screening for osteoporosis is limited.<sup>1,46</sup> The SCOOP trial reported no difference in anxiety between participants in the screening and control groups.<sup>55</sup></p>\r\n<p>Several trials reported on the harms of treatment of bisphosphonates. A pooled analysis of 21 RCTs found no significant difference in serious adverse events. One trial reported a statistically significant increase in gastrointestinal adverse events in the treatment group compared with placebo;<sup>61</sup> however, a pooled analysis of 26 RCTs (representing 27 comparisons) found no significantly increased risk of gastrointestinal adverse events in participants taking bisphosphonates compared with those taking placebo. Six RCTs that reported on the incidence of atrial fibrillation found no statistically significant increased risk. Three RCTs reporting on incidence of myocardial infarction had very imprecise RR estimates with wide CIs because of small sample sizes and rare events.<sup>1,46</sup></p>\r\n<p>Although 1 study of zoledronic acid in men reported a statistically significant increase in incident myocardial infarction (RR, 4.68 [95% CI, 1.02-21.5]), this outcome was not statistically significant in 2 other RCTs. Relative risk estimates were imprecise and CIs were wide in all these studies.<sup>1,46</sup> One cohort study of zoledronic acid users found no statistically significant differences in atrial fibrillation (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.18 [95% CI, 0.99-1.40]), myocardial infarction (aHR, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.64-1.31]), or cardiovascular mortality (aHR, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.81-1.15]) but did find a statistically significant increased risk for heart failure (aHR, 1.32 [95% CI, 1.08-1.61]), although it did not control for known confounders of heart failure such as BMI, smoking and alcohol exposure, or hypertension.<sup>62</sup></p>\r\n<p>Osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical fractures of the femur are potential rare harms of bisphosphonates. Five trials of bisphosphonates reported no cases of osteonecrosis of the jaw, and no trials reported on atypical femur fractures.<sup>1,46</sup> A cohort study of new users of zoledronic acid reported an increased risk of atypical femur fractures (aHR, 2.46 [95% CI, 1.17-5.15]),<sup>62</sup> and a cohort study of new bisphosphonate users reported an increased risk of atypical femur fractures with bisphosphonate use (aHR, 1.53 [95% CI, 1.36-1.73]) over a mean follow-up of 1 year,<sup>63</sup> although both studies may have been subject to residual confounding. One systematic review that did not meet inclusion criteria for the current review because no comparator group of nonusers was included reported incidence estimates for osteonecrosis of the jaw in individuals using bisphophonates ranging from 0.01% to 0.06%.<sup>64</sup></p>\r\n<p>For denosumab, pooled analyses found no significant increase in serious adverse events (5 RCTs) or upper gastrointestinal tract adverse events (4 trials), although the CIs were wide for that outcome. Two trials reported no significant increase in cardiovascular events, although the estimate was imprecise in 1 of these trials. Three trials reported no cases of osteonecrosis of the jaw, and 2 trials reported no cases of atypical femur fracture.<sup>1,46</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from June 11 to July 8, 2024. Some comments requested that the USPSTF recommend screening for osteoporosis in men. The USPSTF agrees that osteoporosis can be a significant source of morbidity and mortality in men. However, there are no studies on the benefits and harms of screening for osteoporosis or fracture risk in men, and evidence on the benefits and harms of treatment is very limited. The USPSTF wants to clarify that the I statement is not a recommendation against screening; it indicates that the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms and is a call for more research. In the absence of evidence, clinicians and their patients should decide together whether to be screened. The USPSTF also wants to reiterate that this recommendation does not apply to individuals, including men, who have medical conditions or are taking medications associated with bone loss.</p>\r\n<p>Some comments requested that this recommendation statement include other modalities in addition to DXA BMD. This recommendation statement focuses on DXA for several reasons, including that DXA is the most commonly used bone density measurement test to screen for osteoporosis, it correlates with bone strength and clinical fracture outcomes, it uses a low dose of radiation, and it was the test used for determining T scores and eligibility among participants in nearly all trials of bone-conserving pharmacotherapies. Some comments requested that the USPSTF specify a screening interval. In response, the USPSTF notes that the evidence related to screening intervals for osteoporosis is limited; what is known that could be helpful is discussed in the Practice Considerations section, and the USPSTF calls for more research to help inform appropriate screening intervals.</p>\r\n<p>In response to public comment, the USPSTF clarified that screening can include DXA with or without fracture risk assessment, that it suggests using a 2-step approach for postmenopausal women younger than 65 years, and that <a href=\"#tab2\">Table 2</a> is intended to provide examples of tools that can be used to predict fracture risk or identify osteoporosis but is not intended to be a comprehensive list. Last, the USPSTF agrees with comments that more research is needed on bone density in transgender persons and has specified this as a research need (see the online version of <a href=\"#tab3\">Table 3</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/home/getfilebytoken/kHT3WGUaG2wTz2pF_ke7bn\">https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/home/getfilebytoken/kHT3WGUaG2wTz2pF_ke7bn</a>]).</p><h2>Research Needs and Gaps</h2><p>See <a href=\"#tab3\">Table 3</a> for research needs and gaps related to screening for osteoporosis to prevent fractures.</p><h2>Recommendations of Others</h2><p>Several organizations have put forth osteoporosis and fracture risk screening guidelines that vary based on age, sex, menopausal status, and other characteristics. Some organizations recommend a combination of fracture risk assessment and DXA screening. In 2023, the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care recommended screening women 65 years or older for fracture risk with the Canadian FRAX tool to facilitate shared decision-making about pharmacotherapy. If pharmacotherapy is considered, it then recommends ordering DXA testing to reestimate fracture risk with BMD input to the FRAX. It recommended against screening men 40 years or older and women younger than 65 years.<sup>65</sup> The 2020 American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists guideline recommends evaluating all women 50 years or older for fracture risk and considering BMD measurement based on clinical fracture risk profile.<sup>66</sup></p>\r\n<p>Other guidelines focus on osteoporosis screening via DXA measurement of BMD in older adults. The 2021 American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists guidelines recommend BMD screening with DXA beginning at age 65 years in all women and selective screening with BMD in women younger than 65 years who have an elevated risk of osteoporosis based on a formal clinical risk assessment tool.<sup>67</sup> The American Academy of Family Physicians follows the USPSTF&rsquo;s 2018 recommendation; however, it specifically recommends against DXA screening in women younger than 65 years and in men younger than 70 years with no risk factors.<sup>68,69</sup></p><h2>Table 2.

These include changes in lowlight vision, color vision, binocularity (ability to focus on an object with both eyes), contrast sensitivity, accommodation (ability to change focus), and stereopsis (depth perception), as well as visual field loss (areas in the field of view in which objects cannot be seen). For the purposes of this recommendation, impaired visual acuity is defined as best corrected vision worse than 20/40 (cutoff for many states for an unrestricted driver&rsquo;s license) and blindness is defined as best corrected vision less than 20/200 or a visual field of 20 degrees or less.<sup>8</sup></p>\r\n<p>Refractive errors, presbyopia, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and cataracts are common causes of impaired visual acuity in older adults.<sup>9-12</sup> Refractive errors, such as myopia (nearsightedness) or hyperopia (farsightedness), occur when the eye is unable to bring parallel rays of light into focus on the fovea.<sup>11</sup> Presbyopia, which occurs as part of the natural aging process of the eye, is the loss of the eye&rsquo;s ability to change its focus to see objects that are near. This occurs as the eyes&rsquo; lenses begin to lose flexibility around age 45 years and affects most individuals at some point in life.<sup>13</sup></p>\r\n<p>AMD is a progressive deterioration of the retina that leads to blurred vision and loss of central vision. It is usually classified into &ldquo;wet&rdquo; or &ldquo;dry&rdquo; forms. The dry form of AMD is more common and associated with atrophy of the retinal layers and retinal pigmented epithelial cells. The wet form of AMD is associated with the development of abnormal blood vessels in the choroid layer underneath the retina.<sup>13,14</sup></p>\r\n<p>Cataracts are a clouding of the lens of the eye that leads to impaired visual acuity, increased sensitivity to glare, and loss of sensitivity to differences in contrast.<sup>13</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Treatment or Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>Although not evaluated in screen-detected populations, several types of treatment are effective for improving visual acuity once visual impairment has been identified. Corrective lenses improve visual acuity in patients with a refractive error. Treatment of cataracts through surgical removal of the natural lens followed by intraocular lens implantation is effective for improving visual acuity.<sup>15</sup> The most common treatment for wet AMD is intravitreal injections of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors. Photodynamic therapy, a treatment combining verteporfin (a photoreactive agent) and low-level laser light, is also used.<sup>13</sup> Laser photocoagulation, an older treatment for wet AMD, is associated with blind spots in the treatment area and is no longer in common use.<sup>14</sup> Treatments to reduce progression of dry AMD include antioxidant vitamins and minerals.<sup>14</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>\r\n<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>\r\n<p>In 2011, an estimated 12% of US adults aged 65 to 74 years and 15% of those 75 years or older reported having problems seeing, even with glasses or contact lenses.<sup>16</sup> Refractive errors are the most common cause of impaired visual acuity in the US and worldwide.<sup>10,17</sup> The prevalence of hyperopia (including presbyopia) increases with age, while the prevalence of myopia tends to decrease with age.<sup>10,12</sup> About half of all cases of bilateral low vision (ie, best-corrected visual acuity worse than 20/40) in adults 40 years or older are caused by cataracts.<sup>18</sup> The prevalence of cataracts increases sharply with age; an estimated 50% of US adults 75 years or older have cataracts.<sup>19</sup> The prevalence of AMD is 6.5% in adults 40 years or older and increases with age (2.8% in adults aged 40 to 59 years and 13.4% in those 60 years or older).<sup>20</sup> AMD is the leading cause of blindness in adults older than 65 years.<sup>13</sup></p>\r\n<p>Older age is an important risk factor for most types of visual impairment. However, there are known risk factors for specific conditions causing impaired visual acuity that vary by condition. A positive family history strongly correlates with myopia and hyperopia.<sup>21,22</sup> Risk factors for cataracts include older age, smoking, alcohol use, exposure to UV light, diabetes, and exposure to oral or inhaled corticosteroids.<sup>23,24</sup> Risk factors for AMD are not completely understood but are thought to include older age, smoking, obesity, diet low in green leafy vegetables, elevated cholesterol levels, cardiovascular disease, and family history.<sup>14,25,26</sup> The prevalence of impaired visual acuity is higher among persons of lower socioeconomic or educational status and those without private health insurance.<sup>13</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Potential Harms</h4>\r\n<p>The harms of screening in a primary care setting have not been adequately studied. Harms of treatment of refractive error may include a potential for increased falls with the use of multifocal lenses; infectious keratitis with the use of contact lenses, LASIK (laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis), or LASEK (laser-assisted subepithelial keratectomy); and corneal ectasia with LASIK.<sup>27</sup> Harms of cataract surgery include posterior lens opacification and endophthalmitis.<sup>27</sup> Antioxidant vitamins and mineral supplements (for dry AMD) and VEGF inhibitors (for wet AMD) are not associated with increased risk of most serious adverse events.<sup>13</sup> Laser photocoagulation and photodynamic therapy for treatment of wet AMD have been associated with risk of acute loss of visual acuity.<sup>13,28,29</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Current Practice</h4>\r\n<p>About half of US adults older than 65 years reported having an eye examination within the last 12 months in a 2007 study.<sup>30</sup> The Snellen eye chart or the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) chart are the most common methods used in primary care settings to detect changes in visual acuity. Other tests available for vision screening in primary care include the pinhole test (a test for refractive error), the Amsler grid (a test of central field of vision to detect AMD), or fundoscopy (visual inspection of the interior of the eye).<sup>13,15,31,32</sup> Clinically significant cataracts can be visualized on physical examination as change of color or opacities in the eye lens.</p>\r\n<p>Impaired visual acuity in older adults may not be recognized by the individual or may remain unreported because vision changes can be relatively subtle, occur in more advanced stages of the condition, progress slowly over time, or occur in persons with cognitive dysfunction or other comorbid conditions.<sup>13</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Other Related USPSTF Recommendations</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF has a separate recommendation on screening for glaucoma (I statement).</p><h2>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h2><p>In 2016, the USPSTF concluded that the evidence was insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for impaired visual acuity in older adults (I statement).<sup>27</sup> This recommendation concurs with the previous I statement.</p><h2>Supporting Evidence</h2><h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF commissioned a systematic review to evaluate the benefits and harms of screening for impaired visual acuity in older adults.<sup>13,33</sup> This review focused on screening for impaired visual acuity associated with uncorrected refractive errors, cataracts, and AMD, as well as treatment of AMD. The benefits and harms related to treatment of uncorrected refractive errors and cataracts has been previously established and is not addressed here.<sup>27</sup> Screening for diabetic retinopathy, another common cause of impaired visual acuity, is not addressed in this recommendation because it is considered part of diabetes follow-up and management.</p>\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening Tests and Risk Assessment</h3>\r\n<p>Eight studies (n = 7398) examined the accuracy of screening tests to detect impaired visual acuity. Visual acuity tests had poor diagnostic accuracy when compared with a complete ophthalmological examination for identifying visual conditions (3 studies; n = 6493). Based on a best corrected visual acuity threshold of 20/30 or worse or 20/40 or worse, sensitivity ranged from 27% to 75% and specificity from 51% to 87%. There was limited evidence on the accuracy of other screening methodologies such as computerized screening tools (2 studies; n = 380), Minimum Data Set Vision Patterns scores (1 study; n = 371), a mobile application tool (1 study; n = 104), and geriatric examination (1 study; n = 50).<sup>13,33</sup> Compared with the Snellen or low vision eye chart, screening questions were not accurate for identifying patients at higher risk of impaired visual acuity because of uncorrected refractive error, cataracts, or AMD (3 studies; n = 5203).<sup>13,33</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>Four randomized trials (n = 4819) studied the difference between vision screening in primary care&ndash;applicable settings vs no screening, usual care, or delayed screening on vision and other clinical outcomes in older adults.<sup>13</sup> Across all trials, screening was based on visual acuity charts (with or without screening questions), pinhole testing, or visual field testing and was part of a larger multicomponent health screening for older adults. These trials found no difference between vision screening vs no screening, usual care, or delayed screening on visual acuity, likelihood of vision disorders, or vision-related functional impairment.<sup>13</sup></p>\r\n<p>In its previous recommendation, the USPSTF established that refractive correction (through corrective lens or surgery) and cataract surgery are effective treatments for refractive errors and cataracts.<sup>27</sup></p>\r\n<p>Four randomized trials (n = 2086) compared VEGF inhibitors for the treatment of wet AMD with placebo or no treatment. Overall, VEGF inhibitors proved effective in improving visual acuity&ndash;related outcomes, including likelihood of visual acuity gain (&ge;15 letters or 3 lines) (relative risk [RR], 2.92 [95% CI, 1.20-7.12]), less than 15 letters of visual acuity loss (RR, 1.46 [95% CI, 1.22-1.75]), and having vision of 20/200 or better (RR, 1.47 [95% CI, 1.30-1.66]).<sup>13</sup> Only 1 trial (n = 716) reported better vision-related function.<sup>13</sup> Three trials (n = 2738) compared the effectiveness of newer (aflibercept) vs older (ranibizumab) VEGF inhibitors for the treatment of wet AMD.<sup>13</sup> Aflibercept was noninferior to ranibizumab (older VEGF inhibitor) in likelihood of less than 15 ETDRS letters of visual acuity loss or more than 15 letters of visual acuity gain (3 trials; n = 2738). Two (of 3) trials (n = 2457) reported on vision-related function and found that aflibercept and ranibizumab were associated with similar improvements.<sup>13</sup></p>\r\n<p>The benefits of treatment of dry AMD were reviewed in 1 systematic review of 19 trials (n = 11,162) and 2 additional trials (n = 180).<sup>13</sup> The findings were heavily influenced by the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) (n = 3640).<sup>34</sup> In that study, patients with dry AMD were randomly assigned to treatment with antioxidants, zinc, antioxidants plus zinc, or placebo. Antioxidant multivitamins were associated with decreased risk of progression to late AMD (odds ratio [OR], 0.72 [95% CI, 0.58-0.90]; 3 trials; n = 2445) and more than 3 lines of visual acuity loss (OR, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.62-0.96]; 1 trial; n = 1791) vs placebo.<sup>13</sup> Zinc was associated with decreased risk of progression to late AMD vs placebo (OR, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.70-0.98]; 3 trials; n = 3790) and decreased risk of less than 3 lines of visual acuity loss (RR, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.75-1.00]; 2 trials; n = 3791); however, the latter finding did not reach statistical significance.<sup>13</sup> The combination of antioxidants and zinc, when compared with placebo, reduced the risk of progression to advanced AMD and visual acuity loss of at least 15 letters in participants with intermediate AMD or advanced AMD in 1 eye (OR, 0.73 [99% CI, 0.54-0.99]).<sup>13</sup> Other potential therapies, including lutein (with or without zeaxanthin), vitamin E, and various antioxidant multivitamin and mineral combinations, showed no clear effects on AMD progression or visual acuity.<sup>13</sup> Evidence on other outcomes associated with the use of antioxidant multivitamins and minerals, such as cognition and vision-related function and quality of life, was limited.</p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Screening and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>No studies were available on the harms of screening for visual impairment in a primary care setting.<sup>13</sup></p>\r\n<p>Potential harms associated with treatment of AMD with intravitreal injections of VEGF inhibitors were studied in several trials. These included endophthalmitis (2 trials; n = 1924), ocular hemorrhage (1 trial; n = 184), and retinal detachment (2 trials; n = 1924), which were found to be similar in VEGF and sham treatment groups. There were no significant differences between VEGF inhibitors and sham treatment in the likelihood of withdrawal due to adverse events.<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;Evidence on the effects of VEGF inhibitors on other harms was limited. Three trials (n = 2738) compared harms related to newer and older VEGF inhibitors for treatment of wet AMD. Serious ocular and cardiovascular adverse events were infrequent and occurred in similar proportions of patients randomized to either aflibercept or ranibizumab.<sup>13</sup></p>\r\n<p>Pooled data on the harms related to treatment of dry AMD reported no association with withdrawal due to gastrointestinal symptoms. The largest trial (AREDS) reported an increased risk of hospitalization due to genitourinary causes with zinc and an increased risk of yellowing skin with antioxidants. The AREDS2 trial (n = 4203) found that the AREDS formulation (vitamin C, vitamin E, zinc, and copper) in combination with beta carotene was associated with increased risk of lung cancer vs the AREDS formulation without beta carotene (2.0% vs 0.9%; <em>P</em> = .04) in former (but not current) smokers.<sup>13</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from October 26 to November 22, 2021. Comments sought clarification on why the USPSTF review included evidence on screening for uncorrected refractive error, cataracts, and AMD but limited its review on treatment to wet and dry AMD. Because the evidence on treatment of cataracts and refractive error (corrective lenses and surgery, respectively) are well established and unlikely to change, the USPSTF limited this review to the benefits and harms of treatment of wet and dry AMD only. This information has been clarified in the Supporting Evidence section. Clarification was also sought on why other conditions such as diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma were not addressed. Diabetic retinopathy is a common cause of blindness; however, surveillance for this condition is considered part of diabetes management and therefore outside the scope of this recommendation. Screening for glaucoma is covered in a separate recommendation.</p>\r\n<p>Comments also noted that certain populations may be at higher risk for visual impairment and should be considered separately. Additionally, many of those persons at higher risk may also have difficulty accessing vision services. Currently, no risk assessment tools are available to reliably identify persons at increased risk for visual impairment who could benefit from screening. The USPSTF is calling for more research on risk assessment tools and screening interventions that include higher-risk groups, as well as more research on how to address barriers to linkage to care.</p>","other":"<h2>Research Needs and Gaps</h2><p>More studies are needed that address the following areas.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Studies that evaluate the effect of referrals by primary care professionals to eye care specialists for comprehensive eye examination.</li>\r\n<li>Well-designed studies in primary care settings that evaluate new vision screening interventions, link screen-positive older adults to appropriate follow-up and care, address barriers to linkage to care, and target higher-risk populations would be useful for clarifying potential benefits of screening.</li>\r\n<li>Evidence on the effectiveness of antioxidant vitamins and minerals for the treatment of dry AMD remains mainly dependent on 1 large trial (AREDS).

Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is the most common form of glaucoma and is the focus of this recommendation.<sup>6</sup></p>\r\n<p>The typical natural history of POAG is gradual loss of peripheral vision, central vision, or both, potentially progressing to blindness. Visual field loss is often detectable before visual acuity loss, which usually occurs later in patients with glaucoma. Rates of progression of POAG vary, although in most patients, significant visual impairment does not occur for years or 1 to 2 decades. Progression of glaucoma is typically measured by progression of visual field deficits and optic disc changes.<sup>7</sup></p>\r\n<p>Impaired visual acuity refers to decreased clarity or sharpness of vision. For the purposes of this recommendation, impaired visual acuity is defined as best corrected vision less than 20/40 (cutoff for many states for an unrestricted driver&rsquo;s license). In the US, blindness is defined as best corrected vision less than 20/200 or a visual field of 20 degrees or less.<sup>1,8</sup> Visual impairment refers to vision-related functional limitations and can occur for reasons other than visual acuity loss.</p>\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>\r\n<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>\r\n<p>The prevalence of POAG in the US is estimated at about 2%.<sup>9</sup> The onset is often in mid-late adulthood, and the number of persons with glaucoma increases with age (from 250,000 persons aged 40 to 49 years to 1.5 million persons 70 years or older).<sup>10</sup> Risk factors for POAG include older age, family history, and Black or Hispanic/Latino race or ethnicity. Physical findings such as increased IOP, thinner central cornea, optic disc hemorrhage, large optic disc cup-to-disc ratio, and lower ocular perfusion pressure are also associated with increased risk of developing POAG.<sup>5,11,12</sup> While the incidence of glaucoma-related blindness has decreased in recent years, the number of persons with glaucoma is projected to increase to an estimated 4.3 million in 2025.<sup>3</sup> Glaucoma disproportionately affects Black and Hispanic/Latino persons.<sup>11-13</sup> These disparities may be related to known disparities in access to health care and glaucoma management.<sup>7</sup> Black persons have the highest prevalence of glaucoma, a higher rate of glaucoma progression and blindness, and earlier presentation of glaucoma symptoms.<sup>7-9,11-13</sup></p>\r\n<p>Whether early glaucomatous changes will progress to visual impairment cannot be precisely predicted. Rates of progression of POAG vary, although in most patients, significant visual impairment does not occur during the first 10 years after diagnosis. Whether the rate of progression of glaucoma remains uniform throughout the disease course is also not known.<sup>7</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Screening Tests</h4>\r\n<p>Diagnosis of open-angle glaucoma is based on a combination of tests showing degenerative changes in the optic disc, increased IOP, and defects in visual fields.<sup>14</sup> Screening might include a smaller combination of tests, or a single test, to identify patients needing further, more comprehensive evaluation for glaucoma. Commonly used tests include tonometry (for IOP), ophthalmoscopy during the dilated eye examination (for evaluation of the optic nerve), perimetry (visual field test), gonioscopy (to measure the angle in the eye where the iris meets the cornea), and pachymetry (to measure the thickness of the cornea). Imaging tests such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) or spectral-domain OCT (which analyzes the spectrum of reflected light on the retina) and optic disc photography (to view the optic nerve head, retina, or both) can supplement the clinical examination. Given that increased IOP is no longer considered necessary or sufficient to diagnose glaucoma, the use of tonometry alone is inadequate to detect cases of open-angle glaucoma.<sup>7</sup> With the exception of visual acuity testing, most tests (eg, OCT, Humphrey Visual Field Analyzer, and tonometry) require specialized equipment and are performed in an eye specialty setting. There are no tools currently available that reliably identify who may be at increased risk for glaucoma or for whom screening may be more beneficial. The USPSTF found no randomized clinical trials that assessed the benefits or harms of primary care referral to specialty eye services.</p>\r\n<h4>Treatment of Open-Angle Glaucoma</h4>\r\n<p>The initial aim of primary treatment of POAG is reduction of IOP, even in persons without elevated IOP. Treatments include medication, laser therapy, and surgery. The American Academy of Ophthalmology recommends medications (most often prostaglandins) or laser trabeculoplasty as initial therapy in most patients.<sup>5</sup> Surgery is usually reserved for patients with severe visual field loss at baseline or patients with advanced POAG who do not respond to medications or laser trabeculoplasty.<sup>7</sup> Although the USPSTF found adequate evidence that treatment of glaucoma reduces intermediate outcomes such as IOP, visual field loss, and optic nerve changes, there was not enough evidence to conclude that these changes would lead to improvements in health outcomes such as visual impairment, vision-related function, and quality of life.</p>\r\n<h4>Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment</h4>\r\n<p>Because not all persons who are diagnosed with and treated for glaucoma progress to visual impairment, potential harms of screening tests include overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Potential harms caused by treatment of glaucoma may include formation of cataracts resulting from surgery, eye irritation from topical medications, or both.<sup>15</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Current Practice</h4>\r\n<p>Data on the frequency of glaucoma screening in primary care settings is unknown, although it is likely uncommon due to a lack of training and specialized equipment. The American Academy of Ophthalmology recommends a baseline comprehensive eye evaluation at age 40 years, with subsequent examinations based on age and risk factors.<sup>14</sup> For glaucoma evaluation, the American Academy of Ophthalmology describes a number of components of the comprehensive eye examination, including visual acuity measurement, pupil examination, anterior segment examination, IOP measurement, gonioscopy, optic nerve and retinal nerve fiber layer examination, and fundus examination.<sup>5</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Other Related USPSTF Recommendations</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF has a recommendation on screening for impaired visual acuity in older adults (I statement).</p><h2>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h2><p>In 2013, the USPSTF concluded that the evidence was insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for glaucoma in adults (I statement).<sup>15</sup> This recommendation concurs with the previous I statement.</p><h2>Supporting Evidence</h2><h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF commissioned a systematic review to evaluate the benefits and harms of screening for glaucoma in adults.<sup>7,16</sup> This review focuses on screening for POAG. Screening for and treatment of other types of glaucoma (ie, narrow- or closed-angle glaucoma and secondary open-angle glaucoma) are outside the scope of this review.</p>\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening Tests and Risk Assessment</h3>\r\n<p>Fifty-three studies (n = 65,464) examined the accuracy of screening tests to detect glaucoma. The largest groups of studies evaluated spectral-domain OCT (29 studies) and tonometry (17 studies), followed by visual fields (9 studies). Most studies evaluated more than 1 test of diagnostic accuracy and the reference standard varied by study, although in general was based on findings related to ophthalmic structure (eg, appearance of optic disc) as well as function (eg, visual fields).<sup>7,16</sup></p>\r\n<p>Both spectral-domain OCT and the Humphrey Visual Field Analyzer (visual field test) were associated with acceptable accuracy. Retinal nerve fiber layer thickness on spectral-domain OCT was associated with a pooled sensitivity of 0.79 (95% CI, 0.75-0.83) and pooled specificity of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.87-0.96) for diagnosing glaucoma vs controls (15 studies; n = 4242).<sup>7,16</sup> Ganglion cell complex thickness measurement using spectral-domain OCT was associated with a pooled sensitivity of 0.74 (95% CI, 0.68-0.80) and pooled specificity of 0.91 (95% CI, 0.80-0.96) for identifying individuals with glaucoma (9 studies; n = 1522). The Humphrey Visual Field Analyzer was associated with a pooled sensitivity of 0.87 (95% CI, 0.69-0.95) and pooled specificity of 0.82 (95% CI, 0.66-0.92), based on 6 studies (n = 11,244). Thirteen studies were included in the pooled analysis evaluating the accuracy of tonometry. Tonometry was associated with a high specificity (0.94 [95% CI, 0.90-0.96]) but lower sensitivity (0.48 [95% CI, 0.31-0.66]) for diagnosing glaucoma.<sup>7,16</sup> Evidence on other screening tests (ophthalmoscopy, optic disc photography, pachymetry, telemedicine, and afferent pupillary defect) was limited.</p>\r\n<p>One study (n = 145) evaluated the accuracy of a risk assessment instrument for identifying persons with glaucoma. Several risk factors were assessed (including age, race, and family history of diabetes or glaucoma), but the study reported low sensitivity (0.20 [95% CI, 0.03-0.56]). Additionally, the highest weight was assigned to previous glaucoma diagnosis, limiting its applicability to asymptomatic populations.<sup>7,16</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>One trial of frail elderly persons (n = 616; mean age, 81 years) studied the effects of screening on health outcomes. This study compared screening by an optometrist that included components relevant for glaucoma diagnosis (ie, visual acuity testing, IOP measurement, direct ophthalmoscopy, and visual field testing) with no screening. At 1 year, there were no differences in vision parameters (mean distance visual acuity or mean near visual acuity) or vision-related quality of life.<sup>7,16</sup></p>\r\n<p>While treatment of POAG was found to improve IOP, there was limited evidence that treatment improved health outcomes such as reduced visual impairment, vision-related function, and quality of life or evidence that improvements in intermediate outcomes leads to improvements in health outcomes.</p>\r\n<p>Sixteen trials (n = 3706) studied the benefits of treatment of glaucoma vs placebo or no treatment. Topical medical treatment was associated with greater reduction in IOP (mean difference, &minus;3.14 mm Hg [95% CI, &minus;4.19 to &minus;2.08]; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 95%; 16 studies) and decreased risk of glaucoma progression at 24 to 120 months (relative risk [RR], 0.68 [95% CI, 0.49-0.96]; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 53%; 7 trials; n = 3771; absolute risk difference, &minus;4.8%). However, evidence on the effects of medical therapy on quality of life was very limited, with 1 trial (n = 461) reporting no differences between latanoprost and placebo in general or vision-related quality of life.<sup>7,16</sup> Because self-perceived vision changes occur very late in the disease course, this finding may be the result of the relatively short duration of the studies.</p>\r\n<p>Four trials (n = 957) compared the effectiveness of laser trabeculoplasty vs medical therapy or no therapy.<sup>7,16</sup> The largest trial (Laser in Glaucoma and Ocular Hypertension Trial [LiGHT]; n = 718) found that laser trabeculoplasty and medical therapy were associated with similar effects on IOP, visual acuity, visual fields, general quality of life, and glaucoma-specific quality of life and function at 3 years after enrollment.<sup>7,16</sup> Three smaller trials reported results consistent with LiGHT for IOP at 4 to 12 months and 5 years; however, the trials did not evaluate other ocular and health outcomes.<sup>7,16</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Screening and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>One trial (n = 616) reported on the harms of screening for open-angle glaucoma in frail elderly persons (mean age, 81 years). The trial intervention was vision screening by an optometrist and involved multiple components, including tests specific for glaucoma (tonometry, direct ophthalmoscopy, and visual field assessment). It found that screening (vs no screening) was associated with an increased incidence of falls (incidence rate ratio, 1.57 [95% CI, 1.20-2.05]) and an increased risk of 1 or more falls (RR, 1.31 [95% CI, 1.13-1.50]) and 2 or more falls (RR, 1.24 [95% CI, 0.99-1.54]). Screening was also associated with increased risk of fracture, although the difference was not statistically significant.<sup>7,16</sup> The reason for the increase in falls was unclear.</p>\r\n<p>Eight trials of medical therapy vs placebo or no treatment reported harms. There were no significant differences in risk of serious adverse events (RR, 1.14 [95% CI, 0.60-1.99]; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 32%; 3 trials; n = 3140), withdrawal due to adverse events (RR, 2.40 [95% CI, 0.71-19.32]; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 0%; 5 trials; n = 648), or any adverse event (RR, 1.56 [95% CI, 0.59-4.03]; <em>I2</em> = 82%; 2 trials; n = 1538).<sup>7,16</sup> Two trials found that treatment was associated with increased risk of ocular adverse events (primarily itching, irritation, tearing, dryness, or taste issues) vs placebo in 1 trial of various treatments and in 1 trial of dorzolamide.<sup>7,16</sup></p>\r\n<p>The LiGHT trial found no difference between laser trabeculoplasty and medical therapy in patients experiencing both adverse and serious adverse events. Evidence on harms from 3 smaller trials was limited.<sup>7,16</sup></p>\r\n<h3>How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?</h3>\r\n<p>The exact cause of POAG is not known. Diagnosis of glaucoma is usually based on several tests that, when combined, evaluate the structure and function of the optic nerve and measure IOP. Persons with POAG may not have increased IOP, and increased IOP may not result in nerve damage and visual impairment. Many persons with glaucoma do not have symptoms. However, once vision loss occurs&mdash;usually slow loss of side vision or peripheral vision&mdash;the optic nerve is already damaged. When damage is severe enough, loss of vision impairs function and quality of life. Treatments that reduce IOP prevent the decline in the structure and function of the optic nerve caused by glaucoma, thus slowing the worsening of visual field loss.</p>\r\n<p>There is limited evidence, however, that improvements in intermediate outcomes (IOP, visual fields, visual acuity, or optic nerve damage) after treatment of open-angle glaucoma improve visual impairment, vision-related function, or quality of life. Additionally, the slowly progressive nature of glaucoma makes it difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments, especially in preventing or slowing clinically noticeable loss of vision, and screening may lead to detection and treatment of many persons who will remain asymptomatic throughout their life (known as overdiagnosis and overtreatment).</p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from October 26 to November 22, 2021. Comments sought clarification on why the USPSTF found insufficient evidence to recommend screening given the USPSTF assessment that there are accurate screening tools and effective treatment for glaucoma. While the USPSTF found adequate evidence that screening tests can identify POAG, these screening tests are not commonly found in primary care settings. Additionally, it found limited evidence that treatment of POAG directly improves health outcomes (such as visual impairment, vision-related function, or quality of life) or that changes in intermediate outcomes (such as changes in the optic nerve or IOP) result in improved health outcomes. Because there was not a clear linkage, it was unclear if changes in intermediate outcomes translate into tangible health outcomes for patients.</p>\r\n<p>Several comments noted the higher prevalence of glaucoma in Black and Hispanic/Latino persons and questioned why the USPSTF did not recommend screening in these higher-risk groups. The USPSTF recognizes that glaucoma disproportionately affects Black and Hispanic/Latino persons; however, it did not find adequate evidence on screening in these higher-risk groups. Additionally, there was a lack of evidence on ways to help identify persons at increased risk who could benefit from screening. The USPSTF is calling for more studies that target higher-risk populations (vs screening all adults). Additionally, the USPSTF wishes to clarify that its I statement is a recommendation neither for nor against screening. Clinicians should continue to use their clinical judgment to determine if screening is appropriate for individual patients.</p>","other":"<h2>Research Needs and Gaps</h2><p>More studies are needed that address the following areas.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Trials are needed that include larger numbers of Black and Hispanic/Latino persons reporting on the effects of screening and treatment of POAG.</li>\r\n<li>Screening trials are needed that assess referral to an eye care specialist and use contemporary screening and diagnostic modalities (eg, spectral-domain OCT or swept-source OCT), are of sufficient duration, and include vision-related outcomes (visual impairment, vision-related function, quality of life, and other patient-reported outcomes).

For persons at higher risk for ocular disease, the American Academy of Ophthalmology recommends that decisions regarding when to initiate eye evaluations and the frequency of periodic examinations be based on the risks but does not provide specific guidance.

It is important that clinicians routinely take a sexual and injection drug use history for all their patients in an open and nonjudgmental manner. All adolescents and adults who are sexually active or who inject drugs should be informed that acquisition of HIV can be prevented, to facilitate subsequent risk assessment and discussions about preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and other ways to prevent acquisition of HIV. Importantly, risk of HIV acquisition exists on a continuum, and currently available risk assessment tools all have limitations. However, certain risk factors or behaviors are known to place persons at increased risk of HIV.</p>\r\n<p>Risk of HIV acquisition depends on the likelihood that a specific act or activity will transmit HIV and the likelihood that a sex partner or drug injection partner has HIV. Likelihood of HIV transmission is highest with needle-sharing injection drug use and condomless receptive anal intercourse. Condomless receptive anal intercourse has an approximately 10- to 15-fold higher risk of transmission than condomless insertive anal sex and condomless receptive and insertive penile-vaginal sex.<sup>5</sup> A 2018 study estimated the prevalence of HIV (ie, an estimate of the likelihood that a partner whose HIV status is unknown has HIV at a population level) as 12.4% among men who have sex with men and 1.9% among persons who inject drugs.<sup>6</sup> The overall prevalence of HIV in the US is estimated at 0.3%.<sup>3</sup> Of note, both the frequency of specific sexual activities and a person&rsquo;s number of sexual partners will also affect their risk of HIV.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF recommends that the following persons be considered for PrEP:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Sexually active adults and adolescents weighing at least 35 kg (77 lb) who have engaged in anal or vaginal sex in the past 6 months and have any of the following:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>A sexual partner who has HIV (especially if the partner has an unknown or detectable viral load).</li>\r\n<li>A bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) (syphilis, gonorrhea, or chlamydia for men who have sex with men and transgender women; gonorrhea and syphilis for heterosexual women and men) in the past 6 months.</li>\r\n<li>A history of inconsistent or no condom use with sex partner(s) whose HIV status is not known; assessing risk in conversation with the patient and considering factors such as number of partners, the specific sexual activities a person engages in, and whether their sex partner or partners are in a group with a higher prevalence of HIV (eg, men who have sex with men or with men and women, transgender women, persons who inject drugs, and persons who engage in transactional sex).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Persons who inject drugs and share injection equipment or have a drug-injecting partner who has HIV.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Persons who engage in transactional sex, such as sex for money, drugs, or housing, including commercial sex workers or persons trafficked for sex work, constitute a group at increased risk of HIV acquisition and should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Persons who request PrEP may have undisclosed behaviors that put them at risk. Transgender women and men who are sexually active should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above. Transgender women are at especially high risk of HIV acquisition. A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) survey in 7 cities found an HIV prevalence of 42% among transgender women. Prevalence was highest among Black transgender women (62%) and Native American/Alaska Native transgender women (65%).<sup>7</sup></p>\r\n<p>In addition, studies have found that transmission of HIV to a seronegative partner from a partner with HIV has not been observed when the partner with HIV was being treated with antiretroviral therapy and had a suppressed viral load.<sup>8-10</sup> It is not known whether PrEP use further decreases the risk of HIV transmission when a partner with HIV has a documented undetectable viral load. Factors such as the consistency or inconsistency of a partner&rsquo;s viral load being suppressed, a partner&rsquo;s adherence to antiretroviral therapy, and the degree of certainty that a partner&rsquo;s viral load is suppressed (eg, self-report vs availability of laboratory test results) may help inform decisions about the use of PrEP in this situation.</p>\r\n<p>All persons being considered for PrEP must have a recently documented negative HIV antigen-antibody test result, and if they have taken oral PrEP or postexposure prophylaxis in the past 3 months, or injectable cabotegravir in the past 12 months, the CDC recommends testing with both an HIV antigen-antibody assay and an HIV-1 RNA assay.<sup>11</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Medication for Prevention of HIV Acquisition</h3>\r\n<p>Currently, several medications are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use as PrEP. Oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) and injectable cabotegravir are approved by the FDA for use in at-risk adults and adolescents weighing at least 35 kg (77 lb) to reduce the risk of sexually acquired HIV.<sup>12,13</sup> Oral tenofovir alafenamide/emtricitabine (TAF/FTC) is approved by the FDA for use in at-risk adults and adolescents weighing at least 35 kg (77 lb) to reduce the risk of sexually acquired HIV, excluding individuals at risk from receptive vaginal sex.<sup>14</sup> No PrEP medications have FDA approval for the indication of reducing the risk of acquiring HIV via injection drug use, but CDC guidelines note that persons who inject drugs are likely to benefit from PrEP with any FDA-approved PrEP medication.<sup>11</sup> No trials of PrEP enrolled persons who were pregnant. FDA labeling permits the use of TDF/FTC in pregnant persons. It also permits the use of TDF/FTC in persons who are breastfeeding and recommends that the potential benefits should be considered along with any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child.</p>\r\n<h3>Implementation</h3>\r\n<p>The first step in implementing PrEP is identifying persons at increased risk of HIV acquisition who may benefit from PrEP. However, identifying persons at risk of HIV can be challenging because of stigma and discrimination against gay, bisexual, transgender, and nonbinary persons and persons who inject drugs, or the lack of a trusting relationship between the patient and clinician. It is important that clinicians routinely take a sexual and injection drug use history for all their patients in an open and nonjudgmental manner and inform all persons who are sexually active or who inject drugs that acquisition of HIV can be prevented. This can facilitate the subsequent discussion between clinician and patient about factors or behaviors that may make a person an appropriate candidate for PrEP.</p>\r\n<p>As noted, FDA labeling permits the use of TDF/FTC in pregnant persons at risk of acquiring HIV.<sup>12</sup> PrEP with TDF/FTC, TAF/FTC, and cabotegravir are also approved for use in adolescents at risk of acquiring HIV who weigh at least 35 kg (77 lb).<sup>12-14</sup> Clinicians need to be aware of any local laws and regulations that may apply when providing PrEP to an adolescent minor.</p>\r\n<p>The CDC provides a complete discussion of implementation considerations for PrEP, including baseline and follow-up testing and monitoring and discontinuing PrEP.<sup>11</sup> A few particularly important points regarding the provision of PrEP are outlined below.</p>\r\n<p>Before prescribing PrEP, clinicians should exclude persons with acute or chronic HIV through taking a medical history and HIV testing. In persons who have taken oral PrEP or postexposure prophylaxis in the past 3 months, or a cabotegravir injection in the past 12 months, the CDC recommends HIV testing with both an HIV antigen-antibody assay and an HIV-1 RNA assay. If they have not, an HIV antigen-antibody assay is recommended as the initial test.<sup>11</sup> The antiretroviral regimens used in PrEP, when used alone, are not effective treatments for HIV, and their use in persons with HIV can lead to the emergence of, or selection for, drug-resistant HIV. It is also recommended that testing for other STIs and pregnancy testing (when appropriate) be conducted prior to initiating PrEP; kidney function testing and serologic testing for hepatitis B virus are recommended prior to initiating PrEP containing tenofovir (TDF/FTC or TAF/FTC), and lipid profile testing is recommended prior to initiating TAF/FTC. Ongoing follow-up and monitoring, including HIV testing every 2 to 3 months depending on PrEP formulation used, is also recommended. The time from initiation of PrEP to achieving protection against acquisition of HIV is unknown. Pharmacokinetic studies of TDF/FTC suggest that maximum intracellular concentrations of the active form of tenofovir are reached in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and rectal tissue after approximately 7 days of daily oral dosing and in cervicovaginal tissues at approximately 20 days.<sup>11</sup></p>\r\n<p>Patients can continue PrEP as long as risk of HIV acquisition continues. Patients may discontinue PrEP for several reasons, including personal preference, decreased risk of HIV acquisition, or adverse medication effects. Patients may reinitiate PrEP if they are again at increased risk of HIV acquisition. Persons reinitiating PrEP should have the same evaluation and testing prior to resuming PrEP as those newly initiating PrEP, including HIV testing. When cabotegravir injections are discontinued, patients should be informed of the long period of gradually declining drug levels, the risk of developing a drug-resistant strain if HIV is acquired during that time, and that the CDC recommends patients use daily oral PrEP or other effective HIV prevention methods if ongoing risk of HIV exposure is anticipated.<sup>11</sup></p>\r\n<p>PrEP does not reduce the risk of other STIs. Consistent use of condoms decreases risk of HIV acquisition by approximately 80%<sup>5</sup> and reduces the risk of other STIs. Promoting consistent condom use is an important component of successful PrEP implementation. The CDC also recommends regular screening for STIs in persons taking PrEP and STI and HIV testing in anyone with signs or symptoms.<sup>11</sup></p>\r\n<p>Clinical trials demonstrate a strong connection between adherence to PrEP and its effectiveness in preventing HIV acquisition.<sup>15</sup> Low adherence is associated with a marked decrease in effectiveness. Therefore, adherence support is a key component of providing PrEP. Components of adherence support include establishing trust and open communication with patients, patient education, reminder systems for taking medication, and attention to medication adverse effects and having a plan to address them. Additional information on adherence support is available in the CDC guidelines.<sup>11,16</sup> Adherence support is especially important in populations known to have lower adherence to PrEP, such as Black persons and young persons.<sup>17,18</sup></p>\r\n<p>It is important for clinicians to recognize that barriers to the implementation and uptake of PrEP exist. These barriers can include structural barriers, such as lack of health insurance, and other factors, such as an individual's belief that they are not a candidate for PrEP or lack of willingness to take PrEP. There are also racial and ethnic disparities in the use of PrEP. Although Black persons are estimated to account for approximately 40% of persons in the US with indications for PrEP, CDC data indicate that the number of White persons prescribed PrEP was approximately 5 times higher than the number of Black persons in 2019.<sup>19</sup> The CDC has estimated that the proportion of persons with indications for PrEP who received it was 60.5% among White persons vs 7.9% in Black persons and 13.8% in Hispanic/Latino persons.<sup>19</sup> Another study reported that Black women, who are also disproportionately affected by HIV, were more than 4 times less likely to have initiated PrEP than White women.<sup>20</sup> CDC data also showed disparities in PrEP use relative to indications for PrEP (PrEP coverage) by sex (lower in females than in males) and age (lower in persons aged 16 to 24 years than in those 25 years or older).<sup>19</sup> Limited data suggest that PrEP use is lower in transgender women than in men who have sex with men.<sup>21</sup> These barriers and disparities need to be addressed to achieve the full benefit of PrEP.</p>\r\n<h3>Additional Tools and Resources</h3>\r\n<p>The CDC provides guidelines on PrEP for the prevention of HIV (<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/risk/prep/cdc-hiv-prep-guidelines-2021.pdf\">https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/risk/prep/cdc-hiv-prep-guidelines-2021.pdf</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/risk/prep/cdc-hiv-prep-provider-supplement-2021.pdf\">https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/risk/prep/cdc-hiv-prep-provider-supplement-2021.pdf</a>). The CDC provides additional resources on PrEP for both clinicians and consumers (<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/risk/prep/index.html\">https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/risk/prep/index.html</a><u>)</u>. The CDC has compiled a list of PrEP interventions and best practices (<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/research/interventionresearch/compendium/prep/complete-list.html\">https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/research/interventionresearch/compendium/prep/complete-list.html</a><u>)</u>. County- and state-level HIV prevalence data for the US are available (<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/atlas\">https://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/atlas</a>).</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF has developed a &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s Talk About It&rdquo; guide for clinicians and patients about the use of HIV PrEP (<a href=\"https://uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation-topics/lets-talk-about-it-discussion-guides\">https://uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation-topics/lets-talk-about-it-discussion-guides</a>).</p>\r\n<h3>Other Related USPSTF Recommendations</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF has issued recommendations on behavioral counseling to reduce risk of STIs,<sup>22</sup> screening for HIV,<sup>23</sup> screening for syphilis in pregnant<sup>24</sup> and nonpregnant<sup>25</sup> persons, screening for genital herpes,<sup>26</sup> screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea,<sup>27</sup> and screening for hepatitis B<sup>28,29</sup> and hepatitis C.<sup>30</sup></p>","other":"<h2>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h2><p>This recommendation replaces the 2019 USPSTF recommendation on PrEP for the prevention of HIV. In 2019, the USPSTF recommended that clinicians offer PrEP with effective antiretroviral therapy to persons at high risk of HIV acquisition.<sup>31</sup> This recommendation is consistent with the 2019 recommendation. For the current recommendation, the USPSTF reviewed additional evidence on new formulations of PrEP and recommends that clinicians prescribe PrEP using effective antiretroviral therapy to persons at increased risk of HIV acquisition, after the clinician and patient have discussed PrEP and the patient agrees.</p><h2>Supporting Evidence</h2><h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n<p>To update its 2019 recommendation statement, the USPSTF commissioned a systematic review<sup>15,32</sup> of the evidence on the benefits and harms of PrEP with TDF/FTC, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate alone, the dapivirine vaginal ring, TAF/FTC, and injectable cabotegravir for the prevention of HIV acquisition, and the diagnostic accuracy of risk assessment tools to identify persons at increased risk of HIV acquisition.</p>\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Risk Assessment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found 12 studies that evaluated risk assessment tools developed in US cohorts for predicting incident HIV. Eight studies were conducted in men who have sex with men, 1 in persons who inject drugs, 1 in cisgender women, and 2 in the general population.<sup>15,32</sup> Among the studies in men who have sex with men and persons who inject drugs that reported this measure, discrimination of the risk assessment tool was moderate, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.60 to 0.73.<sup>15,32</sup> The 2 studies conducted in the general population evaluated 2 different risk assessment tools (number of items, 23 and 44) that used automated algorithms on electronic medical record data. These 2 studies reported moderate to high discrimination for incident HIV (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.74-0.79] and 0.84 [95% CI, 0.80-0.89]).<sup>33,34</sup> One study focused on cisgender women who had a positive HIV test result. It found that a 6-item risk assessment tool, based on electronic medical record data, had sensitivity of 95% for incident HIV (21 cases).<sup>35</sup></p>\r\n<p>All these studies had some limitations. Most of the risk assessment tools were developed and validated using previously collected data (ie, not prospectively validated). The study of cisgender women focused only on persons with a new positive HIV test result; thus, only sensitivity but no other measures of test accuracy could be calculated. Additionally, it was based on a small number of incident cases. The feasibility of implementation of risk assessment tools based on automated algorithms of electronic medical record data are unknown. Last, some studies used cohorts from prior to 2001, and several studies did not predefine the cutoff for a positive test result.<sup>15,32</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Preventive Medication</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found 17 trials that compared a variety of formulations of PrEP with placebo or PrEP with TDF/FTC. Twelve trials compared TDF/FTC or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate alone with placebo, 2 trials compared the dapivirine vaginal ring with placebo, 1 trial compared TAF/FTC with TDF/FTC, and 2 trials compared injectable cabotegravir with TDF/FTC.<sup>15,32</sup></p>\r\n<p>In the 12 trials of TDF/FTC or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate alone, duration of follow-up ranged from 4 months to 4 years. Six trials enrolled men and women at risk of acquiring HIV via heterosexual contact, 4 trials enrolled men who have sex with men or transgender women, 1 trial enrolled at-risk women and men who have sex with men, and 1 trial enrolled persons who inject drugs. No trial enrolled pregnant persons or persons younger than 18 years. Seven trials were conducted in Africa, 1 in Thailand, 2 in Europe or Canada, and 1 in the US; 1 trial was multinational. All trials of persons at risk of HIV acquisition via heterosexual contact were conducted in Africa. All trials included behavioral and adherence counseling, and most provided condoms to all trial participants.<sup>15,32</sup></p>\r\n<p>In a pooled analysis, TDF/FTC or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate alone was associated with significantly decreased risk of HIV acquisition vs placebo or no PrEP (11 trials [n = 18,172]; relative risk [RR], 0.46 [95% CI, 0.33-0.66]; absolute risk reduction, &minus;2.0% [95% CI, &minus;2.8% to &minus;1.2%] after 4 months to 4 years).<sup>15,32</sup></p>\r\n<p>There was a strong association between degree of adherence (assessed in different studies by methods such as patient self-report, pill counts, adherence monitoring devices, plasma drug levels, and prescription fill data) and the effectiveness of oral PrEP (<em>P </em>&lt; .001 for interaction). In 6 trials in which adherence was 70% or greater, the RR of HIV acquisition was 0.27 (95% CI, 0.19-0.39), in 3 trials in which adherence was greater than 40% to less than 70%, the RR was 0.51 (95% CI, 0.38-0.70), and in 2 trials in which adherence was 40% or less, oral PrEP was not associated with a decreased risk of HIV (RR, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.72-1.20]).<sup>15,32</sup></p>\r\n<p>Oral PrEP with TDF/FTC or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate alone was consistently associated with decreased risk of HIV acquisition vs placebo when trials were stratified according to HIV risk category (men who have sex with men, men and women at risk via heterosexual contact, or persons who inject drugs) or setting (highly developed or less highly developed countries).<sup>15,32</sup> The effectiveness of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate alone (RR, 0.49 [95% CI, 0.28-0.84]) and TDF/FTC (RR, 0.44 [95% CI, 0.27-0.72]) were similar.<sup>15,32</sup> All trials evaluated daily PrEP, except for 1 trial of event-driven PrEP (consisting of 2 tablets of TDF/FTC 2 to 24 hours before intercourse, followed by 1 tablet 24 hours and 48 hours after the first dose) in men who have sex with men. This trial found event-driven PrEP was associated with a significantly decreased risk of HIV acquisition compared with placebo (RR, 0.14 [95% CI, 0.03-0.63]),<sup>36</sup> although in that trial, men randomly assigned to PrEP took an average of about 4 doses of PrEP per week, so it is uncertain whether this finding would apply to less-frequent use of event-driven dosing.</p>\r\n<p>In a pooled analysis of 2 trials, the dapivirine vaginal ring was associated with decreased risk of HIV acquisition compared with a placebo ring in African women at risk of HIV (n = 4564; RR, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.57-0.89]).<sup>15,32</sup> The absolute risk reduction was &minus;2.23% (95% CI, &minus;3.75% to &minus;0.74%) at 1.4 to 1.6 years.<sup>15,32</sup> Notably, the dapivirine vaginal ring is not approved by the FDA and is not available for use in the US.</p>\r\n<p>One trial, DISCOVER (n = 5387), compared PrEP with oral TAF/FTC vs TDF/FTC. It was conducted in Europe and North America and enrolled HIV-negative cisgender adult men (98.6%) and transgender women (1.4%) who have sex with men and are at risk of HIV acquisition, based on having condomless anal intercourse with at least 2 partners in the previous 12 weeks or an STI (syphilis, rectal gonorrhea, or rectal chlamydia) in the previous 24 weeks. At 96 weeks, TAF/FTC was associated with a statistically nonsignificant decreased risk of HIV acquisition vs TDF/FTC (0.3% vs 0.6%; RR, 0.53 [95% CI, 0.23-1.26]); results were within the prespecified noninferiority margin (ie, TAF/FTC was noninferior to TDF/FTC).<sup>37,38</sup></p>\r\n<p>Two trials (HIV Prevention Trials Network [HPTN] trials 083 and 084) compared long-acting injectable cabotegravir (600 mg intramuscularly every 8 weeks, following a 5-week oral lead-in phase of 30 mg daily) vs daily oral TDF/FTC.<sup>39,40</sup> In HPTN 083 (n = 4566), 87% of participants were men who have sex with men and 12% were transgender women who have sex with men. Among US participants (37% of total participants), 50% were Black. At median follow-up of 1.4 years, injectable cabotegravir was associated with a significantly decreased risk of HIV acquisition vs oral TDF/FTC (0.6% vs 1.7%; RR, 0.33 [95% CI, 0.18-0.62]). In stratified analysis, results were similar in men who have sex with men (hazard ratio, 0.35 [95% CI, 0.18-0.68]) and transgender women (hazard ratio, 0.34 [95% CI, 0.08-1.56]), although the estimate for transgender women was imprecise.<sup>39</sup> HPTN 084 (n = 3178) was conducted in 7 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Participants were female (sex assigned at birth), were aged 18 to 45 years (median, 25 years), reported engaging in vaginal intercourse in the prior 30 days, and were assessed as being at risk for HIV acquisition using a risk prediction instrument developed and validated in African women. At median follow-up of 1.2 years, injectable cabotegravir was associated with a significantly decreased risk of HIV acquisition vs oral TDF/FTC (0.3% vs 2.3%; RR, 0.11 [95% CI, 0.04-0.31]).<sup>40</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Preventive Medication</h3>\r\n<p>The trials that investigated the effectiveness of PrEP also reported on harms. Oral PrEP with TDF/FTC or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate alone was associated with increased risk of kidney adverse events (primarily grade 1 or higher creatinine level elevation) (12 trials [n = 18,170]; RR, 1.43 [95% CI, 1.18-1.75]; absolute risk difference, 0.56% [95% CI, 0.09%-1.04%]). Kidney abnormalities generally resolved following PrEP cessation. Oral PrEP with TDF/FTC or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate alone was associated with increased risk of gastrointestinal adverse events (12 trials [n = 18,300]; RR, 1.63 [95% CI, 1.26-2.11]; absolute risk difference, 1.95% [95% CI, 0.48%-3.43%]), which were generally not serious and diminished over time. TDF/FTC and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate alone were associated with a statistically nonsignificant increased risk of fracture vs placebo (7 trials [n = 15,241]; RR, 1.23 [95% CI, 0.97-1.56]); this outcome was heavily weighted by 1 trial conducted in persons who inject drugs.<sup>15,32</sup></p>\r\n<p>One trial (n = 5387) reported no differences between TAF/FTC and TDF/FTC in rates of any kidney adverse events (1% vs 1%) or risk of fracture (2% vs 2%).<sup>38</sup> Two trials (n = 7786) reported no differences between long-acting injectable cabotegravir and TDF/FTC in risk of decreased creatinine clearance or elevations in alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase levels. Cabotegravir was associated with increased weight gain compared with TDF/FTC (mean differences, 0.86 and 0.4 kg) and increased risk of injection site reactions (most commonly pain) that were usually mild.<sup>39,40</sup></p>\r\n<p>One concern about PrEP is that its use may lead to persons at risk of HIV acquisition not using condoms or engaging in other behaviors that could increase their risk of STIs (ie, behavioral risk compensation). In pooled analyses of randomized trials, there were no differences between PrEP with TDF/FTC or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate alone and placebo in risk of syphilis (4 trials [n = 10,775]; RR, 1.08 [95% CI, 0.98-1.18]), gonorrhea (5 trials; RR, 1.07 [95% CI, 0.82-1.39]), chlamydia (5 trials; RR, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.80-1.18]), or combined bacterial STIs (2 trials; RR, 1.14 [95% CI, 0.97-1.34]),<sup>15,32</sup> although all trials except for 1 were blinded, which could affect risk of STIs if participants who do not know whether they are taking PrEP or placebo behave differently than those who know they are taking PrEP. In the 1 open-label trial, there was also no statistically significant association between PrEP and the risk of STIs, although estimates were imprecise.<sup>41</sup> Two trials of the dapivirine vaginal ring<sup>42,43</sup> also reported no differences in risk of STIs vs placebo.</p>\r\n<p>An additional concern is the possibility that the use of antiretroviral drugs as PrEP could lead to the development or acquisition of drug-resistant HIV. Among all patients randomized to oral PrEP with TDF/FTC or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate alone, 2 of 3149 patients taking tenofovir disoproxil fumarate alone (0.06%) (4 trials) and 14 of 5085 patients taking TDF/FTC (0.3%) (7 trials) were identified as having incident HIV with a drug resistance variant.<sup>15,32</sup> Most resistance variants occurred in persons who already had HIV on trial enrollment but were not recognized as such, highlighting the importance of testing for HIV and excluding persons with HIV before initiating PrEP. In 5 observational studies of PrEP with TDF/FTC, 2 of 1936 participants (0.1%) were diagnosed with an antiretroviral drug resistance variant.<sup>15,32</sup> In the DISCOVER trial (n = 5387), among 20 patients who tested positive for HIV and had resistance testing results, an emtricitabine resistance variant was detected in 4 patients. All cases occurred in patients randomized to TDF/FTC who were suspected of having HIV at baseline.<sup>37</sup></p>\r\n<p>In 2 trials of the dapivirine (a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor [NNRTI]) vaginal ring, the proportion of patients randomized to dapivirine with an NNRTI resistance variant was 0.8% (22/2620). In both trials, the rate of NNRTI resistance variants among patients with incident HIV was similar in patients randomized to the dapivirine vaginal ring vs those randomized to placebo (11.8% [8/68] vs 10.4% [10/96]; <em>P </em>= .80<sup>41</sup> and 18.2% [14/77] vs 16.1% [9/56]; <em>P </em>= .75).<sup>43</sup></p>\r\n<p>In the HPTN 083 and HPTN 084 trials, which compared cabotegravir (an integrase strand transfer inhibitor [INSTI]) with TDF/FTC, among all patients randomized to cabotegravir, the proportion with an INSTI resistance variant was 0.1% (4/3874), although only 13 of 17 individuals with incident HIV across both trials underwent resistance testing. Among individuals randomized to TDF/FTC across both trials, the proportion found to have antiretroviral resistance variants was also 0.1% (5/3870).<sup>39,40</sup></p>\r\n<p>Evidence on the effect of acquiring antiretroviral-resistant HIV on clinical outcomes is very limited. One study reported that among 5 patients previously exposed to PrEP and diagnosed with HIV with an M184V or M184I (emtricitabine) variant, 4 had an undetectable viral load 3 months after starting antiretroviral therapy and 1 patient was lost to follow-up.<sup>44</sup> Another study included 52 persons diagnosed with HIV who reported recent PrEP exposure. All 39 individuals with a viral load greater than 200 copies/mL at baseline who received antiretroviral therapy achieved an undetectable viral load at 24 weeks. Results were not reported separately for patients with an antiretroviral resistance variant.<sup>45</sup></p>\r\n<p>No trials of PrEP enrolled persons who were pregnant. However, among persons who became pregnant, a pooled analysis of 3 trials of TDF/FTC or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate alone found that PrEP was not associated with increased risk of spontaneous abortion (3 trials [n = 415]; RR, 1.09 [95% CI, 0.79-1.50]).<sup>15,32</sup> One trial found no differences between TDF/FTC or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate alone and placebo in pregnancy rate, risk of preterm birth, congenital anomalies, or postpartum infant mortality.<sup>46</sup> There were no differences between the dapivirine vaginal ring and placebo in incidence of pregnancy.<sup>42,43</sup> In 1 trial of cabotegravir enrolling female participants, pregnancy incidence was low with both cabotegravir and TDF/FTC, and no congenital abnormalities were observed.<sup>40</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from December 13, 2022, to January 17, 2023. Most comments were supportive of the USPSTF recommendation. Comments suggested that alternate wording for the term <em>HIV infection</em> be used. The USPSTF is committed to the use of nonstigmatizing and inclusive language, and in response removed the word &ldquo;infection&rdquo; from its recommendation. The USPSTF agrees with comments that adherence support is an important component of providing PrEP and notes this in the Implementation section. In response to public comment, the USPSTF clarified that persons who request PrEP may have undisclosed behaviors that put them at risk of HIV acquisition. The USPSTF also added detail about considerations when discontinuing cabotegravir to the Implementation section. Last, the USPSTF clarified that gender-diverse persons are among the included individuals for the research gap on the need for accurate and validated risk assessment tools.</p><h2>Research Needs and Gaps</h2><p>Studies are needed that provide the following information.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Research is needed to develop and validate tools that are accurate for identifying persons at increased risk of HIV acquisition who would benefit from PrEP.

It notes that identification of at-risk individuals for whom PrEP is recommended requires individualized approaches that consider past and future anticipated risk.<sup>48</sup></p>","topic":"Prevention of Acquisition of HIV: Preexposure Prophylaxis","keywords":"HIV PrEP|PrEP|pre-exposure prophylaxis|prophylaxis|prevention|preventive medication|adult adolescent","pubDate":"2023-08-22","categories":["11"],"tool":["527","534","533","532","531","530","529","528"]},"857":{"topicType":"Screening","topicYear":2024,"uspstfAlias":"speech-and-language-delay-and-disorders-in-children-age-5-and-younger-screening","specific":[2031],"title":"Speech and Language Delay and Disorders in Children: Screening","rationale":"<h2>Importance</h2><p>Speech and language delays and disorders can pose significant problems for children and their families.

Speech disorders are defined by difficulty with forming specific sounds or words correctly (articulation) or making words or sentences flow smoothly (fluency). Language disorders are characterized by difficulty understanding (receptive language) or speaking (expressive language) relative to a child&rsquo;s peers.<sup>6,7</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>Although the evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against screening, there are several screening tools used in primary care settings to detect speech and language delays and disorders. Some tools are part of a larger instrument designed to assess general development that includes multiple questions specific to speech and language (eg, Ages &amp; Stages Questionnaires, Third Edition).<sup>6</sup> Other tools (eg, Language Development Survey and Early Language Scale) are designed to assess only speech and language development. Most screening instruments are unable to discern the difference between a child who has a delay (ie, a child with late-emerging language during the first 2 years of life) that subsequently resolves without treatment and one who will go on to display a speech and language disorder (ie, a child who will later receive a formal diagnosis of specific language impairment).<sup>6</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Treatment or Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>Interventions for childhood speech and language delays and disorders vary widely and can include speech-language therapy sessions and assistive technology.<sup>8</sup> Interventions are commonly individualized to each child&rsquo;s specific pattern of symptoms, needs, interests, personality, and learning style.<sup>6</sup> Treatment plans also incorporate the priorities of the child, parents, teachers, or some combination thereof. Speech-language therapy may take place in various settings, such as speech and language specialty clinics, the school or classroom, the home, and via telehealth.<sup>6,9</sup> Therapy may be administered on an individual basis or in groups and may be child-centered or include peer and family components. Persons administering therapy may be speech-language pathologists, educators, or parents. The duration and intensity of the intervention usually depend on the severity of the speech or language disorder and the child&rsquo;s progress in meeting therapy goals.<sup>6</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>\r\n<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>\r\n<p>Information about the prevalence of speech and language delays and disorders in young children in the US is limited, and prevalence varies by age and other factors. In a 2016 report, the National Academy of Sciences estimated that the prevalence of speech and language disorders ranges between 3% and 16% of US children and adolescents aged 3 to 21 years.<sup>10</sup></p>\r\n<p>Several risk factors have been reported to be associated with speech and language delay and disorders, including male sex, family history of speech and language impairment, low parental education level, and perinatal risk factors (eg, prematurity, low birth weight, and birth difficulties).<sup>11</sup></p>\r\n<p>Multiple studies have demonstrated a higher prevalence among boys than girls and among certain groups defined by race and ethnicity. A 2012 survey found that nearly 8% of children aged 3 to 17 years had a communication disorder (speech and language disorder), with boys almost twice as likely to be affected than girls. In the same study, approximately 10% of children identified as non-Hispanic Black were affected compared with 6.9% of children identified as Hispanic and 7.8% identified as White.<sup>12</sup> Disparities in the prevalence of speech and language delay and disorders have also been observed based on various measures of socioeconomic status, including type of insurance. For example, a nationally representative US cohort study found that by age 8 years, the prevalence of speech or language disorders was significantly higher among publicly insured children (8.4%) than privately insured children (4.5%).<sup>13</sup></p>\r\n<p>Many children identified as toddlers with speech and language delays go on to recover without intervention. One systematic review estimated that approximately 60% of children with expressive language delay and 25% with receptive and expressive delay recovered without intervention.<sup>14</sup> However, evidence also suggests that school-aged children with speech or language delays may be at increased risk of learning and literacy disabilities, including difficulties with reading and writing.<sup>1-3</sup> Observational cohort studies suggest that children with these conditions may also be at higher risk for social and behavioral problems in addition to learning problems, some of which may persist through adulthood.<sup>4,15</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Potential Harms</h4>\r\n<p>The potential harms of screening and interventions for speech and language delays and disorders in young children in primary care include the time, effort, and anxiety associated with further testing after a positive screening result, as well as the potential harms associated with diagnostic labeling.<sup>16</sup> The USPSTF found no studies on these harms.<sup>6</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Current Practice</h4>\r\n<p>Surveillance and screening for speech and language delay and disorders is commonly performed as part of routine developmental surveillance and screening in primary care settings (ie, during well-child visits).<sup>17</sup> An estimated 30% of US children aged 9 to 35 months received a parent-completed developmental screening in the past year, with significant variation across states (ranging from 17% in Mississippi to 59% in Oregon).<sup>18</sup> General screening instruments with speech and language components (eg, Ages &amp; Stages Questionnaires) are the most-used tools.<sup>19</sup> It is unclear how many clinicians use tools specific to speech and language development.<sup>6</sup></p>\r\n<p>Implementation of screening and treatment protocols remain a challenge. Based on data from the 2012 National Health Interview Survey, approximately one-half of all children aged 3 to 17 years with a speech and language disorder received an intervention service in the previous 12 months.<sup>12</sup> Additionally, disparities exist in the rates of referral or services by race and ethnicity for children who are identified as having a potential speech or language problem. Children identified as Hispanic/Latino and Black are less likely to receive services compared with children identified as White.<sup>12</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Other Related USPSTF Recommendations</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF has a separate recommendation statement on screening for autism spectrum disorder (I statement).<sup>20</sup></p>","other":"<h2>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h2><p>In 2015, the USPSTF concluded that the evidence was insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for speech and language delay and disorders in children 5 years or younger (I statement).<sup>16</sup> The current recommendation concurs with the previous I statement.</p><h2>Supporting Evidence</h2><h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF commissioned a systematic review to evaluate the benefits and harms of screening for speech and language delay and disorders in children 5 years or younger.<sup>6,21</sup> It also evaluated evidence on whether interventions for screen-detected speech and language delay and disorders lead to improved speech, language, or other outcomes, as well as the potential harms associated with screening and interventions. Treatment studies enrolling children up to age 6 years were eligible, given that children who would be screened at age 5 years and referred for treatment may not receive services immediately.<sup>6,21</sup></p>\r\n<p>The review was limited to studies in children who had not been previously identified with another disorder or disability that may cause speech or language impairment. The review excluded studies that focused on acquired, focal causes of speech and language delay.<sup>6,21</sup> Although abnormal speech and language development may be associated with autism spectrum disorder, this review did not evaluate screening for autism spectrum disorder. The USPSTF has a separate recommendation statement on screening for autism spectrum disorder.<sup>20</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF identified 21 good- or fair-quality studies (n = 7489) that evaluated the accuracy of 23 screening tools for detecting speech and language delays and disorders in young children.<sup>6,21</sup> The age of study populations ranged from 12 to 70 months (approximately 5.80 years), with a mean age of 39 months. Recruitment techniques and venues included primary care practices, childcare centers/preschools/kindergartens, health/public health centers, advertisements, birth announcements, early childhood programs, and Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) offices. In the 16 studies that reported the sex of the participants, 47% were female.<sup>6</sup> Most studies did not report race and ethnicity. The median prevalence of speech and language disorders in the study populations was 16% (range, 4%-59%).<sup>6</sup></p>\r\n<p>Thirteen speech- and language-screening tools were designed to be administered by a trained examiner and 10 were parent reports of speech or language skills. Twelve instruments were designed to screen for global language delay and disorders, 9 were designed to screen for specific language problems such as expressive language skills or understanding of syntax, and 4 were used to screen for articulation problems.</p>\r\n<p>Overall, the median sensitivity and specificity of instruments for detecting speech and language delay and disorders was 86% (range, 17%-100%) and 87% (range, 32%-98%), respectively.<sup>6,21</sup> Test accuracy varied in terms of whether the instruments were completed by parents vs trained examiners and whether the instruments focused on global language, specific language skills, or articulation. In general, screening tools designed for use by trained examiners were slightly more accurate than those designed for parent reports.<sup>6,21</sup> Few screening instruments were assessed by more than 1 study each, making it difficult to make conclusions about the accuracy of specific questionnaires.<sup>6,21</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no studies addressing the direct benefits of screening for speech and language delay and disorders on health outcomes such as school performance, function, or quality-of-life outcomes.<sup>6,21</sup></p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF identified 17 randomized clinical trials on the potential benefits of interventions for children diagnosed with speech and language delays and disorders.<sup>6,21</sup> Study participants were recruited from several different settings, including schools or early childhood education centers (4 studies), referrals to speech and language treatment centers (6 studies), via advertisements (4 studies), and a mix of advertisements and outreach to schools, clinical settings, or community-based programs. Few studies reported the race and ethnicity of the participants. The mean age of enrolled populations ranged from 18.1 to 67.8 months (5.6 years), with the majority of studies (10 studies) including a population with a mean age of 48.4 months or older.<sup>6,21</sup></p>\r\n<p>The included studies evaluated a diverse array of interventions that targeted different populations of children (eg, any delay or disorder or speech disorders only) and varied by setting, intensity/duration, and delivery personnel. Eight trials assessed interventions specific to children with language delay and without fluency or speech-sound impairment. Of these, 2 studies evaluating more intensive parent-delivered, group training interventions found benefits for expressive language outcome measures.<sup>6,21</sup> Other interventions for language delay varied by delivery setting, population, and other factors. In general, results were inconsistent, with some studies showing improvement in some measures of receptive or expressive language but others not. Two randomized clinical trials assessed treatment for young children with fluency disorder (stuttering) delivered by a speech-language pathologist. Both found benefit for reducing stuttering frequency at 9 months postintervention. It was unclear whether these children were identified by formal screening or through normal surveillance.<sup>6,21</sup></p>\r\n<p>Eight studies reported on outcomes related to school or academic performance, early literacy, functional communication, or quality of life.<sup>6,21</sup> No individual study was replicated by a study using the same intervention and reporting similar measures. Four studies reported measures of early literacy, with only 1 trial demonstrating statically significant benefit for improving letter knowledge. Two trials assessing different interventions for speech-sound disorders found no statistically significant difference between groups on measures of functional communication. No study reported benefit for improving function or quality of life among children.<sup>6,21</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Screening and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF identified no studies on the potential harms of screening or interventions for speech and language delay and disorders in children.<sup>6,21</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from July 25, 2023, to August 21, 2023. Many comments expressed that readers might misinterpret the I statement as a recommendation against screening or that treatment of speech and language delay is ineffective. Given the disparities in access to care among marginalized groups, commenters felt an I statement could discourage clinicians from screening and further widen health disparities for these children. The USPSTF wishes to clarify that its I statement is a conclusion that the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for speech delays and disorders and is neither a recommendation for nor against screening. Clinicians should continue to use their clinical judgment to determine if screening is appropriate for individual patients.</p>\r\n<p>Several comments noted the higher prevalence of speech and language delay in Black and Hispanic/Latino children and questioned why the USPSTF did not recommend screening in these higher-risk groups. The USPSTF recognizes that speech and language delay is more prevalent among certain marginalized groups; however, it did not find evidence on screening in asymptomatic higher-risk groups. Additionally, few studies on treatment of screen-detected speech and language delay reported the race or ethnicity of their participants. The USPSTF is committed to addressing health disparities and is calling for more studies that focus on higher-risk populations.</p><h2>Research Needs and Gaps</h2><p>See <a href=\"#tab2\">Table 2</a> for the research needs and gaps related to screening for speech and language delay and disorders in children.</p><h2>Recommendations of Others</h2><p>The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends routine developmental <em>surveillance</em> at all well-child visits. Additionally, it recommends developmental <em>screening</em> (which may include speech and language domains, but is not specific to speech and language delay and disorders) with validated tools at the 9-month, 18-month, and 30-month visits.<sup>17,22,23</sup> The Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care recommends against screening for developmental delay using standardized tools in children aged 1 to 4 years with no apparent signs of developmental delay and whose parents and clinicians have no concerns about development.<sup>24</sup></p><h2>Table 2.

Traditionally, children and adolescents are categorized as having &ldquo;overweight&rdquo; when their BMI is between the 85th and 95th percentile and as having &ldquo;obesity&rdquo; when their BMI is at or above the 95th percentile on CDC growth charts. In this recommendation, the USPSTF will use the general term &ldquo;high BMI&rdquo; when referring to youth considered to be above &ldquo;normal&rdquo; body weight status (&ge;95th percentile for age and sex) according to CDC standards. Specific BMI cutoffs (&ldquo;&ge;95th percentile for age and sex&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;obese&rdquo; and &ldquo;85th to 95th percentile for age and sex&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;overweight&rdquo;) will also be used when feasible. BMI is an imperfect measure of adiposity and is not an equivalent measure of adiposity across all racial and ethnic populations. However, most children with a BMI-for-age at or above the 95th percentile have high adiposity, while few children with a BMI-for-age below the 85th percentile have high adiposity.<sup>1,6</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Behavioral Counseling Interventions and Implementation Considerations</h3>\r\n<p>Comprehensive, intensive behavioral interventions with at least 26 contact hours or more that include supervised physical activity sessions for up to 1 year result in weight loss in children and adolescents.<sup>1</sup> Effective, high-intensity (&ge;26 contact hours) behavioral interventions result in greater weight loss than less intense interventions and result in some improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors.<sup>1</sup> These behavioral interventions consist of multiple components, and although components vary across interventions, many of the studied interventions include sessions targeting both the parent and child (separately, together, or both); offer group sessions in addition to individual or single-family sessions; provide information about healthy eating, safe exercising, and reading food labels; and incorporate behavior change techniques such as problem solving, monitoring diet and physical activity behaviors, and goal setting.<sup>1</sup> These types of interventions are often delivered by multidisciplinary teams, including pediatricians, exercise physiologists or physical therapists, dietitians or diet assistants, psychologists or social workers, or other behavioral specialists.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF recognizes the challenges that the families of children and adolescents encounter in accessing effective, intensive behavioral interventions for high BMI. Identifying high BMI and how to address it are important steps in helping children and adolescents and their families obtain the support they need. The USPSTF also understands that stigma associated with high BMI can be harmful to children and adolescents. However, the USPSTF did not find evidence that behavioral interventions resulted in additional stigma. Also, none of the trials found a decrease in self-esteem or body satisfaction, or an increase in disordered eating, associated with behavioral interventions.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Pharmacotherapy Considerations</h3>\r\n<p>While several medications demonstrated greater weight loss than placebo, the totality of the evidence was found to be inadequate. An important limitation of the pharmacotherapy studies was that there was only a single trial for each effective medication (ie, phentermine/topiramate, semaglutide, and liraglutide) that lasted longer than 2 months.<sup>1</sup> The limited evidence on weight maintenance after pharmacotherapy discontinuation suggests that weight rebound starts soon after discontinuation, implying that long-term use will be needed to maintain weight loss. However, there is no evidence on the harms of long-term medication use.<sup>1</sup> In addition, pharmacotherapy is associated with moderate harms due to gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fecal incontinence, flatus, and gallstones).<sup>1</sup> Therefore, the USPSTF encourages clinicians to promote behavioral interventions as the primary effective intervention for weight loss in children and adolescents.</p>\r\n<h3>Additional Tools and Resources</h3>\r\n<p>The Community Preventive Services Task Force recommends several youth interventions promoting physical activity and healthy eating, access to affordable healthy food and beverages, healthy food and beverage choices, and fostering physical activity among children, reducing sedentary screen time, and using digital health interventions for weight management (<a href=\"https://www.thecommunityguide.org/pages/task-force-findings-obesity.html\">https://www.thecommunityguide.org/pages/task-force-findings-obesity.html</a>).</p>\r\n<p>The US Department of Health and Human Services published the &ldquo;Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans,&rdquo; which provides recommendations for how physical activity can help promote health and reduce the risk of chronic disease for Americans 3 years or older (<a href=\"https://health.gov/our-work/nutrition-physical-activity/physical-activity-guidelines\">https://health.gov/our-work/nutrition-physical-activity/physical-activity-guidelines</a>).</p>\r\n<p>The CDC has resources available for families and clinicians addressing high BMI at <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/\">https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/</a>.</p>\r\n<h3>Other Related USPSTF Recommendations</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF has issued recommendations on screening for high blood pressure in children and adolescents,<sup>7</sup> screening for lipid disorders in children and adolescents,<sup>8</sup> and screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents.<sup>9</sup> Current versions of these and other related USPSTF recommendations are available at <a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/\">https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/</a>.</p>","other":"<h2>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h2><p>This recommendation updates the 2017 USPSTF recommendation statement on screening for obesity in children and adolescents 6 years or older (B recommendation).<sup>8</sup></p><h2>Supporting Evidence</h2><h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF commissioned a systematic evidence review<sup>1,10</sup> to update its 2017 recommendation on screening for obesity in children and adolescents.<sup>11</sup> Because assessing BMI is now part of routine clinical practice, it was not a focus of this review. The USPSTF reviewed evidence on interventions (behavioral counseling and pharmacotherapy) for weight loss or weight management that can be provided in or referred from a primary care setting. Interventions that did not include a weight loss or weight management component were not eligible for inclusion in this review. Surgical weight loss interventions are generally not first-line preventive interventions and are outside the scope of the review.</p>\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Behavioral Counseling and Pharmacotherapy Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>Fifty randomized clinical trials (RCTs) (N = 8798) examined behavioral interventions. Twenty-eight trials were conducted in the US; the remaining 22 were conducted in Europe, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Israel, and Turkey. Twenty-seven trials were conducted in primary care settings, and the remaining 23 were conducted in other health care settings (eg, various specialty outpatient clinics or research facilities).<sup>1,10</sup> Most trials (41/50) included study participants who had a BMI at or above the 85th percentile or at or above the 95th percentile for their age or sex according to CDC growth charts, country-specific norms, or International Obesity Task Force norms. The mean BMI percentile was 93 (range, 84.9-99.2).<sup>1,10</sup> Trials included children and adolescents aged 2 to 19 years. Eighteen trials were limited to elementary school&ndash;aged children (aged 6 to 8 years, up to age 12 years); 13 trials included preschool-aged or elementary school&ndash;aged children to adolescents; 12 trials evaluated adolescents only; and 7 trials targeted preschool- to kindergarten-aged children.<sup>1,10</sup></p>\r\n<p>Most trials did not report on race or ethnicity or included predominantly White study participants. Trials conducted in the US had a more diverse study population; trials were mostly composed of White (52.4%), Black (20.5%), and Hispanic/Latino (25%) study participants.<sup>1,10</sup> There was limited inclusion of Asian or Native American/Alaska Native participants. Most trials described the level of patient participation in interventions. In the included trials, 31% to 93% of participants completed all sessions. The average percentage of sessions completed generally ranged from 60% to 80%.<sup>1,10</sup></p>\r\n<p>Trials rarely reported health outcomes (eg, depression or social adjustment). However, pooled analyses demonstrated a statistically significant increase in global quality of life after 6 to 12 months (mean difference in change, 1.9 [95% CI, 0.2 to 3.5]; 11 RCTs; n = 1922). Among studies with more contact hours (&ge;26 contact hours), the mean difference in change in quality-of-life measures was 3.8 points (95% CI, 3.6 to 4.1) (most scales ranged from 0-100).<sup>1,10</sup> No studies reported longer-term benefits on health outcomes. Studies suggest that 4.4- to 5.4-point differences in the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) represent a minimal clinically important difference, and some of the included trials of higher-contact interventions did report improvement in this range on the PedsQL among children participating in the interventions.<sup>1,10,12,13</sup></p>\r\n<p>Behavioral interventions were associated with reductions in BMI and other weight-related outcomes after 6 to 12 months (mean difference in change between groups, &minus;0.7 [95% CI, &minus;1.0 to &minus;0.3]; 28 RCTs [n = 4494]; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 86.8%). Larger effects were seen in interventions with more contact hours (&ge;26) and physical activity sessions (1.4-point reduction in BMI [95% CI, &minus;2.2 to &minus;0.6]; 11 RCTs [n = 1087]; <em>I</em><sup>2</sup> = 87.8%; and 2.6-kg loss in weight [95% CI, &minus;3.8 to &minus;1.3 kg]; 10 RCTs [n = 907]; <em>I</em><sup>2</sup> = 58.2%).</p>\r\n<p>Other weight and adiposity outcomes showed similar patterns.<sup>1,10</sup></p>\r\n<p>Cardiometabolic risk factors (eg, lipid levels, blood pressure, and fasting plasma glucose level) were reported by 16 trials (n = 1700).<sup>1,10</sup> Pooled analyses of trials providing 26 or more contact hours and physical activity sessions showed improvements in blood pressure (eg, mean difference in systolic blood pressure, &minus;3.6 mm Hg [95% CI, &minus;5.7 to &minus;1.5 mm Hg]; 8 RCTs [n = 773]; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 47.3%; mean difference in diastolic blood pressure, &minus;3.0 mm Hg [95% CI, &minus;5.7 to &minus;1.5 mm Hg]; 8 RCTs [n = 774]; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 49.3%) and fasting plasma glucose level (mean difference, &minus;1.9 mg/dL [95% CI, &minus;2.7 to &minus;1.2 mg/dL]; 4 RCTs [n = 367]; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 0%) after 6 to 12 months.<sup>1,10</sup> Pooled results of all 16 studies (including those with &lt;26 contact hours) were not associated with improvements in systolic blood pressure.</p>\r\n<p>Although the USPSTF found no evidence to determine the individual benefits of specific intervention components, effective interventions commonly included supervised physical activity sessions; provided information about healthy eating, safe exercising, and reading food labels; and incorporated behavior change techniques such as problem solving, monitoring diet and physical activity behaviors, and goal setting.</p>\r\n<p>Evidence on effective interventions in children younger than 6 years is limited.<sup>1,10</sup></p>\r\n<p>Eight trials assessed pharmacotherapy interventions: liraglutide (3 RCTs [n = 296]), semaglutide (1 RCT [n = 201]), orlistat (2 RCTs [n = 579]), and phentermine/topiramate (2 RCTs [n = 269]). Five trials included behavioral counseling components along with the medication or placebo. Seven of the 8 trials were either conducted entirely in the US or had study sites in the US; the remaining trial was conducted in Germany.<sup>1,10</sup> The majority of study participants were 12 years or older or 14 years or older; 1 study included children aged 7 to 11 years.<sup>1,10</sup> The evidence base for each medication was limited, consisting of only 1 trial per medication with 12 months or longer of treatment.<sup>1,10</sup></p>\r\n<p>Only 1 medication, semaglutide, was associated with a greater improvement in weight-related quality of life than placebo (mean difference, 5.3 [95% CI, 0.2 to 8.3]) (scales ranged from 0-100), which is consistent with published minimal clinically important differences for the PedsQL (range, 4.4-6.3 points).<sup>1,10,12,13</sup> Three other pharmacotherapy trials found no between-group differences in change in quality of life or depression incidence compared with placebo after 6 to 13 months.<sup>1,10</sup></p>\r\n<p>Pharmacotherapy was associated with larger mean BMI reductions compared with placebo in most trials. Liraglutide was associated with a 1.6-point greater reduction in BMI than placebo (mean difference, &minus;1.6 [95% CI, &minus;2.5 to &minus;0.7] after 13 months), semaglutide with a 6.0-point greater reduction in BMI (mean difference, &minus;6.0 [95% CI, &minus;7.3 to &minus;4.6] after 16 months), orlistat with a 0.9-point greater reduction (mean difference, &minus;0.9 [95% CI not reported]; <em>P</em> = .001; after 12 months), and phentermine/topiramate with 3.7- to 5.4-point greater reductions (15/92-mg dose mean difference, &minus;5.4 [95% CI, &minus;6.4 to &minus;4.3]; 7.4/46-mg dose mean difference, &minus;3.7 [95% CI, &minus;5.0 to &minus;2.5] after 13 months).<sup>1,10</sup> Group differences were not maintained in the liraglutide study after 6 months without treatment. While there was an initial reduction in BMI, longer-term maintenance after medication withdrawal was either not reported for any of the other medications or showed immediate weight increase after discontinuation. All medications showed increases in the likelihood of losing both 5% and 10% of baseline weight or BMI.<sup>1,10</sup></p>\r\n<p>Cardiometabolic outcomes were reported for orlistat (2 RCTs) and 1 study each of phentermine/topiramate, liraglutide, and semaglutide. The only medication that showed a clear reduction in blood pressure was phentermine/topiramate and only at the higher dose level (mean difference, &minus;4.0 [95% CI, &minus;7.7 to &minus;0.5]).<sup>1,10</sup> Semaglutide improved low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (mean difference in percent change, &minus;7.1 [95% CI, &minus;11.9 to &minus;1.8]), and phentermine/topiramate improved high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (eg, mean difference in percent change, 8.8 [95% CI, 2.2 to 15.4] for 15/92-mg/d dose); other medications did not demonstrate statistically significant improvements. None of the pharmacotherapy trials found improvements in glucose-related parameters.<sup>1,10</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Potential Harms of Behavioral Counseling and Pharmacotherapy Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>Eighteen trials (n = 2539) examined the harms of behavioral interventions. Outcomes were reported 6 to 12 months after baseline assessments. None of the trials found an increased risk of any adverse event or serious adverse events, including disordered eating, or decreases in self-esteem or body satisfaction.<sup>1,10</sup></p>\r\n<p>Eight trials (n = 1345) examined the adverse effects of pharmacotherapy. More than 60% of youth taking liraglutide, semaglutide, or orlistat experienced gastrointestinal adverse effects (eg, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, gallstones, flatus with discharge, and fecal incontinence). For example, in the largest trial of liraglutide, gastrointestinal adverse effects occurred in 65% of study participants in the intervention group vs 36% in the placebo group (relative risk, 3.20 [95% CI, 1.91 to 5.36]).<sup>1,10</sup> Musculoskeletal and psychiatric adverse effects were most reported with phentermine/topiramate (at doses of 15/92 mg/d) (8.8% with intervention vs 1.8% with placebo for both categories of adverse effects).<sup>1,10</sup> Serious adverse effects were rare in all of the pharmacotherapy trials. No evidence was available on adverse effects beyond 1 month after medication discontinuation or longer than 17 months for any medication.<sup>1,10</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from December 12, 2023, to January 16, 2024. In response to comments, the USPSTF clarified the type of studies eligible for inclusion in the Scope of Review section. The USPSTF incorporated language in the Practice Considerations section regarding the harms associated with having a high BMI and the use of BMI for assessment/screening. The USPSTF also listed additional resources to help clinicians in the Additional Tools and Resources section.</p><h2>Research Needs and Gaps</h2><p>See <a href=\"#tab2\">Table 2</a> for research needs and gaps related to interventions for high BMI in children and adolescents.</p><h2>Recommendations of Others</h2><p>The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends plotting BMI on a growth chart at all pediatric visits for all patients 2 years or older. It also recommends comprehensive treatment of high BMI with improved nutrition, physical activity, behavioral therapy, and consideration of pharmacotherapy according to US Food and Drug Administration indications for children 12 years or older and consideration of bariatric surgery for adolescents.<sup>14,15</sup> The Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health recommends growth monitoring for all children and adolescents 17 years or younger at primary care visits. It also recommends that primary care clinicians offer or refer children and adolescents with high BMI to structured behavioral interventions aimed at healthy weight management.<sup>16</sup> The American Psychological Association recommends family-based multicomponent behavioral interventions with a minimum of 26 contact hours, initiated at an early age for children and adolescents with overweight or obesity.<sup>17</sup> The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends screening for adolescent overweight and obesity and that adolescents with overweight or obesity be screened for depression and bullying and appropriately referred. It also recommends that clinicians initiate behavioral counseling or other multidisciplinary management as necessary. It does not recommend metformin for adolescent weight loss alone and recommends that bariatric surgery should only be considered after careful candidate selection by a multidisciplinary team.<sup>18</sup> Additionally, it recommends that clinicians caution against the use of weight loss supplements. The Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine calculating BMI percentile for all adolescents, reinforcing healthy behaviors, and counseling regarding body image, inappropriate dieting, and weight stigmatization, when indicated. For patients with a high BMI, it also recommends behavioral counseling or, if needed, referral to more intensive treatment options such as weight loss surgery.<sup>19</sup> The National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners recommends measuring BMI in children 2 years or older and assessing family eating patterns, physical activity, sedentary time, and daily screen time in all children. It further recommends that weight loss programs be multicomponent and accessible within clinical, school, or community settings.<sup>20,21</sup></p><h2>Table 2.

Of the estimated 600,000 youth experiencing abuse and neglect (per 2021 CPS reports), most had experienced neglect (76%), and many experienced physical abuse (16%), sexual abuse (10%), and sex trafficking (0.2%).<sup>3</sup> Of the more than 1800 children who died of child maltreatment in 2021, most had experienced neglect (78%), and nearly half experienced physical abuse (43%) alone or in combination with another type of maltreatment (eg, neglect and psychological maltreatment).<sup>3</sup> Young children are most vulnerable to child maltreatment and death.<sup>3</sup> About one-fourth of maltreatment victims (28%) are children between birth and age 2 years, and children younger than 3 years comprise almost two-thirds (66%) of all child fatalities.<sup>3</sup></p>\r\n<p>A National Incidence Study of Child Abuse and Neglect report includes maltreatment estimates for youth investigated by CPS and for youth not reported to CPS, or not investigated by CPS yet recognized as maltreated.<sup>1,7</sup> In its latest report from 2005-2006, 1 in every 58 children in the US experienced maltreatment.<sup>7</sup> Most experienced neglect (61%), while almost half (44%) experienced abuse.<sup>7</sup> Of children who were abused, most experienced physical abuse (58%), but also emotional abuse (27%) or sexual abuse (24%).<sup>7</sup> More recent reports suggest child maltreatment prevalence is more common. According to the National Survey of Children&rsquo;s Exposure to Violence report from 2013-2014, which obtains prevalence and incidence estimates of a wide range of childhood violence, crime, and abuse through telephone interviews of children and adolescents younger than 18 years, an estimated 1 in 7 US children experienced maltreatment.<sup>8,9</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Potential Harms</h4>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found limited evidence on the harms associated with interventions to prevent child maltreatment. Some evidence suggests that participation in interventions could increase the likelihood of being reported to child welfare agencies.<sup>1</sup> Given pervasive racial and ethnic disparities in child maltreatment reporting, investigation, and placement in the child welfare system, biases in identification of child maltreatment may disproportionately disadvantage Black, Hispanic, and Native American/Alaska Native families.<sup>1</sup> These disadvantages may be related to complex intersections of factors, including racism, race, low socioeconomic status, living in neighborhoods of low socioeconomic status, and increased exposure to social service agencies and law enforcement contributing to increased likelihood of being reported for child maltreatment.<sup>1</sup> Additional potential harms of preventive interventions include social stigma and effects on family functioning and dynamics.</p>\r\n<h4>Current Practice</h4>\r\n<p><strong>Identification.</strong> Due to the recommended schedule of periodic health assessments and relationship with families, primary care clinicians are uniquely positioned to identify child maltreatment. Because maltreatment is rarely witnessed by persons other than a child and perpetrator, and there is no single test to confirm abuse or neglect, identification and diagnosis of child maltreatment can be challenging.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<p>Risk assessment instruments are designed to assist in identifying youth for whom preventive interventions might be indicated. However, the USPSTF found limited and inconsistent evidence on the validity and reliability of risk assessment instruments. There is no gold standard for these instruments; measures to validate instruments (eg, CPS reports) are imprecise and likely overreport or underreport true child maltreatment.<sup>1</sup> A majority of risk assessment instruments are designed for emergency department or hospital setting use.<sup>1</sup> These instruments appear more accurate in identifying children at risk for maltreatment than instruments designed for use in the primary care or home setting.<sup>1</sup> Instruments that do not depend on clinician judgement (eg, instruments based on relationships between risk factors and maltreatment rather than clinician perception of parental practices) appear better at predicting onset of maltreatment than instruments based primarily on the judgement of clinicians.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<p><strong>Reporting.</strong> Children with signs or symptoms suggestive of maltreatment should be assessed and reported according to the applicable state laws.</p>\r\n<p>Clinicians tend to disproportionately report abuse among children from racial and ethnic minority groups compared with White children.<sup>1,10,11</sup> In addition, some studies demonstrate more missed cases of maltreatment in White children.<sup>1</sup> Native American/Alaska Native<sup>12</sup> youth are reported to CPS at higher rates than their representation in the population.<sup>1</sup> Hispanic youth are overrepresented in child maltreatment reports in some US states and underrepresented in others compared with their representation in the population.<sup>1</sup> Sources of these inequities are complex and likely include racism resulting in subjectivity, inconsistency, and clinician bias<sup>13-15</sup> in reporting child maltreatment.<sup>1</sup> Social factors (eg, socioeconomic status<sup>16</sup> or insurance type) may be associated with clinician decisions to report child maltreatment.<sup>1,14</sup></p>\r\n<p><strong>Diagnosis.</strong> Assessment for possible physical abuse may include a comprehensive medical and event history, physical examination, and further diagnostic workup (eg, imaging or laboratory testing) as needed.<sup>1,17</sup> Variations in practice and clinician bias may contribute to missed diagnoses, which has significant consequences for youth; up to one-half of children (39%-50%) with unrecognized abuse sustain additional abuse-associated injuries within 1 year.<sup>1</sup> Social factors (eg, socioeconomic status<sup>16</sup> or insurance type) may intersect with racism to affect clinician decisions to pursue diagnostic testing for child maltreatment.<sup>1</sup> In a study of abusive head trauma, abuse appeared more likely to be unrecognized and misdiagnosed in White children younger than 3 years living with a mother and father compared with children of &ldquo;minority races&rdquo; or children who live in households in which both parents did not live together.<sup>11</sup> Evidence suggests that use of clear and consistent diagnostic guidelines may reduce variations in medical practice and racial disparities.<sup>1</sup> In a study evaluating the effects of guideline implementation on racial and socioeconomic disparities, after implementation of a protocol recommending all children younger than 1 year with unwitnessed head trauma receive a skeletal survey, racial disparities declined.<sup>1,18</sup> Prior to implementation of the protocol, Black children underwent more skeletal surveys than White children (91% vs 69%; <em>P</em> = .10); after protocol implementation, skeletal survey differences were not statistically significant (92% of Black children vs 85% of White children; <em>P</em> = 1.0).<sup>1,18</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Additional Tools and Resources</h3>\r\n<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report &ldquo;Preventing Child Abuse and Neglect: A Technical Package for Policy, Norm, and Programmatic Activities&rdquo; offers a group of strategies based on best available evidence to assist in prevention of child abuse and neglect (<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/CAN-Prevention-Technical-Package.pdf\">https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/CAN-Prevention-Technical-Package.pdf</a>).

The review focused on interventions to prevent abuse or neglect from occurring and therefore was limited to studies in which the majority (&gt;50%) of children had no previous reports of maltreatment.<sup>1</sup> This scope is similar to that of the prior systematic review. In alignment with the USPSTF&rsquo;s commitment to improving health equity, the evidence review included key questions evaluating the effectiveness of interventions in certain populations and contextual questions on the drivers behind and approaches to address disparities related to child maltreatment.</p>\r\n<h3>Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>Multiple interventions to prevent child maltreatment have been studied, including primary care programs designed to identify youth at increased risk for maltreatment who may benefit from parent education, referral to community resources, approaches to increase the use of positive discipline strategies, and psychotherapy to improve caregivers&rsquo; coping skills and strategies to strengthen the parent-child relationship.<sup>1,22</sup> Interventions commonly address social determinants of health (eg, economic stability and health care access) and include a home visiting component.<sup>1</sup> Some evidence suggests that adverse social determinants of health (eg, low socioeconomic status and food or housing insecurity) may increase risk for child maltreatment.<sup>1,23</sup> The USPSTF considered whether interventions to prevent child maltreatment improved measures of social determinants of health and found inconsistent overall results.<sup>1</sup> However, in populations with increased socioeconomic needs, interventions may improve social determinants of health.<sup>1</sup> Additional evidence is needed to clarify potential linkages between improvements in social determinants of health and child maltreatment prevention.<sup>1</sup> Although the USPSTF found insufficient evidence to assess the benefits and harms of interventions to prevent maltreatment among children without signs or symptoms of maltreatment, this recommendation does not assess the effectiveness of interventions (eg, home visitation programs) for other outcomes (eg, improving child and family well-being).</p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Counseling Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed evidence on the benefits of behavioral counseling interventions to prevent child maltreatment from 25 trials of more than 14,000 participants.<sup>1,21</sup> Of the included randomized clinical trials, most studies (22) assessed interventions with a home visiting component.<sup>1,21</sup> Generally, interventions enrolled participants during the prenatal period or soon after birth, included clinical professionals (eg, nurses), and compared interventions with usual care.<sup>1,21</sup> Outcomes were characterized as direct or intermediate (proxy) measures of child maltreatment.<sup>1,21</sup> Direct measures included direct evidence of physical, sexual, or emotional abuse or neglect (eg, reports to CPS or removal of the child from the home).<sup>1,21</sup> Intermediate measures included injuries with a high specificity of abuse, visits to the emergency department (ED) or hospital, and failure to provide for the child&rsquo;s medical needs.<sup>1,21</sup> Interpretation of some outcomes was unclear; for example, rates of ED visits or hospitalizations could reflect changes in health care access associated with the interventions rather than rates of maltreatment.<sup>1,21</sup> To keep the intended scope focused on evidence for making a recommendation on child maltreatment, all intervention studies were required to report direct or intermediate measures of abuse.<sup>1,21</sup> If direct or intermediate measures of abuse were reported, other measures, including behavioral, developmental, emotional, mental, and physical health, as well as well-being and mortality, were also evaluated.<sup>1,21</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Direct Outcomes</h4>\r\n<p>Fifteen trials (n = 8513) evaluated the effectiveness of interventions based on reports to CPS.<sup>1,21</sup> In a pooled analysis of 11 trials (n = 5311) reporting the first follow-up within 1 year after intervention completion, there were no group differences in effectiveness between intervention and control populations (pooled odds ratio, 1.03 [95% CI, 0.84-1.27]; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 10.2%).<sup>1,21</sup> Four trials could not be pooled due to differences in reported outcome measures.<sup>1,21</sup> Some trials reported additional findings (after the initial follow-up) 6 months to 1 year later and more than 1 year later.<sup>1,21</sup> There were no group differences associated with the intervention in trials reporting supplementary findings 6 months to 1 year after the initial follow-up, and after 1-year follow-up results were mixed; 2 trials reported statistically significant group differences and 2 reported no differences.<sup>1,21</sup></p>\r\n<p>Six trials (n = 3657) evaluated the effectiveness of interventions based on removal of the child from the home.<sup>1,21</sup> In the 5 trials (n = 3336) included in a pooled analysis of results ranging from 12 months to 3 years after intervention, there were no group differences between intervention and control groups (3.9% vs 3.5%; relative risk, 1.06 [95% CI, 0.37-2.99]; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 49.9%).<sup>1,21</sup> A sixth trial was not included in the pooled analysis due to differences in outcome measures but reported no group differences.<sup>1,21</sup></p>\r\n<p>Three trials (n = 2106) reported outcomes related to specific measures of maltreatment identified from review of public agency documents, results of the Framingham Safety Survey, or based on rates of safeguarding (eg, initial assessment, being identified as a child in need, or child protection conference).<sup>1,21</sup> Findings in these trials yielded inconsistent results.<sup>1</sup> In 1 trial, there were no differences reported in physical abuse (relative risk, 1.45 [95% CI, 0.58-3.62]) or neglect (relative risk, 2.79 [95% CI, 0.98-7.91) between the intervention and control groups.<sup>1,21,24</sup> A second trial reported statistically significant group differences in results from the Framingham Safety Survey on household hazards after the intervention; however, the clinical importance of these results is unclear because the range of the survey&rsquo;s scale was not reported.<sup>1,21</sup> A third trial reported higher rates of safeguarding in the intervention group compared with the control group (adjusted odds ratio, 1.85 [95% CI, 1.02-2.85]).<sup>1,21,25</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Intermediate Outcomes</h4>\r\n<p>Fourteen trials (n = 8180) reported outcomes related to ED visits; generally, fewer visits was interpreted as beneficial.<sup>1,21</sup> Trials evaluating ED visits within 4 years of study enrollment inconsistently demonstrated fewer ED visits.<sup>1,21</sup> Type of outcome measurement (mean difference in ED visits, mean number of all-cause ED visits, or mean number of ED visits for accidents, injuries, and ingestions) and timing of measurement (6 months to more than 4 years after study enrollment) varied substantially across trials, precluding pooling of evidence.<sup>1,21</sup> Two studies found no statistically significant differences in visiting the ED at age 6 months (<em>P</em> = .637 in one study<sup>26</sup> and adjusted odds ratio, 1.52 [95% CI, 0.86-2.70] in the other study<sup>25</sup>).<sup>1,21</sup> In a study reporting mean differences in ED visits for any reason, there were more ED visits in the intervention group compared with the control group (<em>P</em> = .048) at 12 months.<sup>1,21,26</sup> Two trials reported no statistically significant group differences at 12 or 18 months.<sup>1,21</sup> Of 7 studies reporting findings within 1 to 2 years after enrollment, 3 reported statistically significant reductions in the average number of all-cause ED visits, while 4 reported no group differences.<sup>1,21</sup> Long-term results (&gt;4 years of follow-up) noted statistically significant reductions in ED visits in 1 of 3 studies.<sup>1,21</sup></p>\r\n<p>Thirteen trials (n = 7475) reported outcomes related to hospitalizations.<sup>1,21</sup> Varying outcome definitions and timing of outcome measurement prevented pooling of study results.<sup>1,21</sup> Statistically significant reductions in number of children with all-cause hospitalizations, average number of hospital days, and rates of admission were demonstrated in a minority of trials.<sup>1,21</sup> Most trials of hospital-related outcomes reported no difference between study groups.<sup>1,21</sup> For several additional measures of child maltreatment (eg, failure to thrive [1 trial; n = 79] and nonaccidental injuries [1 trial; n = 136]), the USPSTF found insufficient evidence to evaluate intervention effectiveness.<sup>1,21</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Behavioral, Developmental, Emotional, Mental, and Physical Health and Well-Being</h4>\r\n<p>Six trials (n = 5115) reporting internalizing (eg, depression or anxiety) and externalizing (disruptive, aggressive, or delinquent) behavioral outcomes in children yielded mixed results.<sup>1,21</sup> Three of the 6 trials reported statistically significant reductions in reported behaviors, while others reported no group differences.<sup>1,21</sup> Of 5 trials (n = 4439) evaluating social, emotional, and developmental outcomes (eg, sleep issues or dysregulation), none reported group differences.<sup>1,21</sup> Of 4 trials (n = 1638) evaluating outcomes based on the Bayley Scales of Development, 1 reported higher scores in the intervention group, while 3 other trials reported no group differences.<sup>1,21</sup> Three of 5 trials (n = 4542) evaluating other developmental outcomes reported some benefit in study-specific outcomes; however, study construction and outcomes varied substantially and results could not be compared across studies.<sup>1,21</sup> Three trials (n = 3561) evaluating school performance reported no group differences in the percentage of children repeating a grade at age 7 years, grade point averages across reading and math at age 9 years, or special education placements in grades 1 through 3.<sup>1,21</sup> Similarly, 2 trials (n = 2818) evaluating school attendance reported few group differences in school absences between intervention and control groups.<sup>1,21</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Death</h4>\r\n<p>In 6 trials (n = 2900), none of the mortality outcomes reported reached statistical significance.<sup>1,21</sup> Five trials did report lower (statistically nonsignificant) mortality rates in the intervention group and 1 trial reported higher (statistically nonsignificant) mortality rates in the intervention group.<sup>1,21</sup> Fortunately, events were rare, despite inclusion of children judged to be at increased risk for infant mortality.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<p>Overall, evidence on the effect of interventions did not demonstrate benefit, yielded mixed results, or information was insufficent.<sup>1</sup> The USPSTF also considered intervention effectiveness in specific populations of interest defined by child or caregiver characteristics such as age, developmental age (child), sex, gender identity, race and ethnicity, sociodemographic characteristics (eg, family income), or special health care needs.<sup>1</sup> Generally, evidence in these populations was consistent with that of the general population or too limited to draw comparisons.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Counseling Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>Most trials reported rare harms rather than potential harms, such as stigma, labeling, legal risks, risks of further harm to the child, dissolution of families, or worsening inequities.<sup>1,21</sup> Two trials (n = 1784)<sup>25,27</sup> reported miscarriages or terminations of pregnancies; however, these outcomes were unlikely to be related to the intervention in either study.<sup>1,21</sup> One trial reported miscarriage or termination events prior to intervention participation.<sup>1,21</sup> A second trial reported that 43% of mothers or children had a serious adverse event (mainly clinical events associated with pregnancy and the infancy period) in the intervention group compared with 38% in the control group (miscarriages/terminations [24 in the intervention group vs 27 in the control group], stillbirth/neonatal/infant death [5 in the intervention group vs 7 in the control group], death of the mother/infant pair [1 in the intervention group vs 0 in the control group], and adoption of the child [7 in the intervention group vs 7 in the control group]).<sup>1,21,25</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from August 29, 2023, to September 25, 2023. Some comments suggested that a recommendation focused on screening for protective factors or universal primary prevention approaches addressing social determinants of health to mitigate child maltreatment could be linked to improving health outcomes and promoting health equity. Other comments suggested the USPSTF call for additional research on better risk assessment tools to identify at-risk populations who might best benefit from interventions to prevent child maltreatment. The USPSTF agrees that the identification of broad approaches on this topic could be helpful, particularly to better understand whether identifying at-risk populations or whether addressing certain social determinants of health in the primary care setting could prevent child maltreatment. Several comments shared concerns about potential harms of interventions such as removal of children from families, particularly due to potential for bias in CPS referrals. The USPSTF agrees that potential harms of interventions should be carefully weighed against the benefits prior to a making recommendation. As such, prior to making a recommendation, the USPSTF thoroughly considers evidence of benefits and harms and makes recommendations when supported by sufficient evidence. After careful review, the USPSTF concluded that the evidence was insufficient to make a recommendation for or against interventions to prevent child maltreatment. Several comments appreciated the recognition of the influence of social factors and racial and ethnic disparities in reporting and diagnoses of child maltreatment. In alignment with the USPSTF&rsquo;s commitment to advancing health equity, the USPSTF considered evidence on existing disparities related to child maltreatment.</p><h2>Research Needs and Gaps</h2><p>See <a href=\"#tab2\">Table 2</a> for research needs and gaps related to primary care interventions to prevent child maltreatment.</p><h2>Recommendations of Others</h2><p>The American Academy of Family Physicians has concluded there is insufficient evidence regarding screening or interventions and offers a list of steps for preventing child maltreatment.<sup>28</sup> The American Academy of Pediatrics strongly recommends pediatrician involvement in preventing child maltreatment &ldquo;through promotion of safe, stable, nurturing relationships and communities.&rdquo;<sup>29</sup> Bright Futures, a national initiative led by the American Academy of Pediatrics and supported in part by the US Department of Health and Human Services, Health Resources and Services Administration, and Maternal and Child Health Bureau recommends anticipatory guidance (preventive education and guidance) and screening for social determinants of health for risks (including family or neighborhood violence, food security, or family substance use) and protective factors (emotional security and self-esteem or connectedness with family) during childhood and adolescence.<sup>30</sup> The Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care recommends home visitation programs to &ldquo;disadvantaged families&rdquo; to prevent child maltreatment and recommends against screening, citing the risks of false-positive results and mislabeling.<sup>31</sup> The Community Preventive Services Task Force recommends home visitation to high-risk families to prevent child maltreatment.<sup>32</sup></p><h2>Table 2.

For example, food insecurity is associated with other factors such as housing instability and transportation issues. A related term, &ldquo;social need,&rdquo; refers to the desire for assistance in addressing a social risk factor and reflects an individual&rsquo;s priorities.<sup>6</sup></p>\r\n<p>Food insecurity is defined as an economic and social condition of perceived limited or uncertain access to sufficient amounts of nutritious food needed for an active and healthy life.<sup>7</sup> Food insecurity can be long term, temporary, episodic (eg, running out of money at the end of the month), or related to a specific event (eg, loss of employment). It can also differ among household members, such as when parents or caregivers go without food to maintain their children&rsquo;s diet. Food insecurity differs from hunger, which is generally defined as an individual-level physiological state that may result from food insecurity.<sup>8</sup></p>\r\n<p>Individuals may respond to food insecurity by changing their preferred variety of foods, food sources (eg, grocery stores, convenience stores, or food pantries), the amount of food they consume, or going without food.<sup>9,10</sup> The USDA provides clarification on both food insecurity and food security. Regarding food insecurity, &ldquo;very low food security&rdquo; is when some household members reduce their food intake because of an inability to afford enough food, and &ldquo;low food security&rdquo; is when at some point during the year, households reduced the quality, variety, or desirability of their diets but maintained normal eating patterns.<sup>11</sup> Food security is also divided into 2 categories: &ldquo;marginal food security,&rdquo; in which households had problems or anxiety accessing food at times but did not substantially alter the quality, variety, or quantity of their intake, and &ldquo;high food security,&rdquo; in which households had no problems or anxiety about consistently accessing adequate food.<sup>11</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Populations at Risk</h3>\r\n<p>Poverty, due to unemployment or other conditions, is the primary cause of food insecurity. Studies have reported that certain populations, such as households with children (particularly those with children younger than 6 years); households headed by a single caregiver; households of those with incomes below 185% of the poverty level; older adults; individuals with disabilities; and veterans are at higher risk for food insecurity.<sup>3</sup> Having a chronic medical condition is both a risk factor for and associated with food insecurity. Persons living in low-income neighborhoods are at increased risk of food insecurity for several reasons, including limited access to healthy foods, fewer full-service grocery stores, and limited public and private transportation options.<sup>12-14</sup></p>\r\n<p>There are significant disparities in food insecurity by race and ethnicity. According to data from the USDA, in 2022, 20% of Hispanic households, 22% of non-Hispanic Black households, and 9% of White households experienced food insecurity.<sup>1</sup> Recent estimates for Native American/Alaska Native populations are not available, but in the decade leading up to a 2010 report, annual estimates ranged between 20% and 30%.<sup>15</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>There are limited data on how screening tools are used in clinical practice. Multiple social risk factors are often assessed via multidomain tools (eg, Well Child Care, Evaluation, Community Resources, Advocacy, Referral, Education [WE CARE]; Protocol for Responding to and Assessing Patients&rsquo; Assets, Risks, and Experiences [PRAPARE]) rather than screening for food insecurity alone.<sup>3,16</sup> The most frequently used and studied single-domain screening tool for food insecurity is the 2-item Hunger Vital Sign tool. The first question asks respondents if during the past 12 months, they (1) worried about running out of food and not having money to buy more, and (2) experienced running out of food and not having money to buy more.<sup>17-19</sup> It is derived from, and validated against, the USDA Household Food Security Survey.<sup>19</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Treatment or Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>Interventions applicable to health care settings include food prescription programs; food boxes or pantries provided in, or linked to, clinics; and medically tailored meals.<sup>20,21</sup> Another common form of primary care&ndash;based intervention is care coordination linking patients with local, state, or federal programs. The majority of these programs, such as food pantries, free lunch programs, the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program, or the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children are delivered in community settings rather than through primary care.</p>\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>\r\n<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>\r\n<p>Living in a household with food insecurity as a child is associated with obesity, asthma, mental health conditions, and worse oral health.<sup>2,22</sup> Experiences of hunger due to food insecurity during childhood have also been associated with poor health later in life.<sup>23,24</sup> Adults with food insecurity often experience chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. The exact reasons for these connections are unclear, but evidence suggests that stress, challenges managing existing health conditions, dietary changes toward less healthy options, and changes in gut bacteria could all play a role.<sup>3</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Potential Harms</h4>\r\n<p>No studies reported on the harms of screening.<sup>25,26</sup> Potential harms include stigma, fear of involvement in the legal/justice system (eg, disclosing food insecurity, prompting Child Protective Services involvement), and other privacy concerns.</p>\r\n<h4>Current Practice</h4>\r\n<p>Several studies indicate that clinicians and patients believe that social risks and/or needs, including food insecurity, should be addressed in health care settings. However, estimates of screening for food insecurity vary considerably across providers (between 25% and 100%).<sup>27</sup> The screening tool, setting, type of visit, format/mode of delivery, and timing of screening varies across practice settings.<sup>28</sup> Additionally, some health care systems use screening tools to measure prevalence and better understand the needs of their population, while others screen and follow with referrals, clinical care, and additional services.<sup>20</sup></p>\r\n<p>While it is known that food and nutritional security change over time, there is limited research on the appropriate screening interval for food insecurity. Most screening tools do not assess the duration or periodicity of food insecurity and therefore cannot assess whether it is temporary.<sup>29</sup> One study of food insecurity over the first years of the COVID-19 pandemic found that children of caregivers who received general social needs screenings and relevant referrals every 6 months had greater improvements in social needs than those who received annual well-child screenings and referrals.<sup>30</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Other Related USPSTF Recommendations</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF has recommendation statements related to other social drivers of health, including screening for intimate partner violence, elder abuse, and abuse of vulnerable adults and the primary prevention of child maltreatment.<sup>31,32</sup></p>","other":"<h2>Supporting Evidence</h2><h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF commissioned a systematic review to evaluate the benefits and harms of screening for food insecurity in the health care setting. To be included in the review, studies had to have occurred in a health care setting and include screening conducted in a clinical setting or identified through a health care delivery or payment system and interventions or programs integrated into, associated with, or referred from health care.<sup>3,33</sup> Studies limited to participants who were undergoing cancer treatment, had other acute medical or psychiatric conditions, or had severe malnutrition or known nutritional deficiencies were excluded from the review.<sup>3,33</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening Tests and Risk Assessment</h3>\r\n<p>Ten fair-quality studies with a total of 123,886 participants assessed 1-item (1 study), 2-item (8 studies), or 6-item (1 study) screening tools for performance.<sup>3,33</sup> All were derived from the USDA&rsquo;s 18-item Household Food Security Survey. Study settings included primary care (4 studies), primary care plus emergency department (2 studies), emergency department (1 study), and dental clinic (1 study).<sup>3,33</sup> The remaining 2 studies analyzed US Census data. Five studies included only adult participants, 4 studied families with children, and 1 studied teenagers and young adults (aged 15 to 25 years). Eight studies only administered the reference standard and then assessed agreement between item subsets and the full version.<sup>3,33</sup></p>\r\n<p>For the 2-item screening tool, the sensitivity was typically above 95% and specificity was above 82% when the screening tool was fully embedded in the reference standard (in most cases, the 18- or 6-item version of the Household Food Security Survey) or administered within the same larger questionnaire.<sup>3,33</sup> However, the lack of independent administration of the screening tool likely overestimated the performance of the screening tool under usual clinical use.<sup>3,33</sup> The 1-item screening tool had the lowest accuracy, with a sensitivity of 59% and specificity of 87%, but it was also the only study of the screening tool in which it was administered independently from the reference standard.<sup>3,33</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Screening and Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF identified 1 fair-quality randomized clinical trial (n = 789) examining the benefits of screening for food insecurity in families with children younger than 6 years.<sup>3,33</sup> Parents in the intervention group were screened for child maltreatment risk factors (intimate partner violence, parent depression, substance misuse, and use of corporal punishment), which included food insecurity. Families screening positive for food insecurity were given information on how to access federal and local food-related assistance. It found no difference in the percentage reporting food insecurity after 6 months between the intervention group (29.6% with food insecurity) and usual care (29.8% with food insecurity).<sup>34</sup></p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed 2 fair-quality studies (n = 220) examining the benefits of health care&ndash;related interventions on food security, intermediate outcomes, and health outcomes.<sup>3,33</sup> The first was a randomized crossover trial (n = 44) that included home delivery of medically tailored meals to patients with diabetes for 12 weeks.<sup>35</sup> At the end of the study period (24 weeks), the intervention was associated with reduced food insecurity (41.9% with food insecurity while receiving meals vs 61.5% while not receiving meals; <em>P</em> = .05), improved mental health quality of life (4.7-point change from baseline while receiving meals vs 0.8-point change while not receiving meals), and improved diet quality (eg, the 100-point total Healthy Eating Index score improved by 14.1 points while receiving meals compared with baseline but declined by 17.3 points while not receiving meals). However, there was no impact on other quality-of-life measures; physiologic measures of blood pressure, lipid levels, or glucose levels; or cost-related medication underuse.<sup>3,33,35</sup></p>\r\n<p>The second fair-quality study (n = 176) was a nonrandomized study of interventions comparing children in families who participated in a mobile food pantry with a propensity score&ndash;matched cohort of pediatric patients from the same neighborhood as the mobile pantry participants or from nearby neighborhoods not offering a mobile pantry program.<sup>36</sup> At 6 months, the study found a smaller increase in body mass index among those who participated in the mobile food pantry. It did not report between-group differences in food insecurity but reported a 1-point reduction (4.3 to 3.3) on a 6-point food insecurity scale among participants in the intervention group.</p>\r\n<p>Several other studies (27 studies) were found that did not contribute to the USPSTF assessment of the evidence because they were of poor quality due to a high risk of bias for the outcomes of interest. Many were pre-post studies or were designed for other purposes (eg, primary interest in other outcomes or comparative effectiveness).<sup>3,33</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Screening and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPTF found no eligible studies on the harms of screening.<sup>3,33</sup> Only 1 study of interventions, the trial of home-delivered meals (n = 44), provided data on intervention harms. Harm was observed for only 1 participant who experienced gastrointestinal distress.<sup>35</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comments</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from June 25, 2024, to July 22, 2024. Some comments expressed that the evidence reviewed by the USPSTF was too narrow in scope and should have included interventions outside the primary care setting and evaluated programs such as the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. USPSTF recommendations focus on services that can be provided in or referred from the primary care setting. The USPSTF did not review evidence on federal programs because these are not under the auspices of health care systems. The USPSTF did include studies of interventions to help facilitate enrollment in these programs. Several commenters asked that the USPSTF include evidence from a broader range of studies (eg, qualitative studies or studies without comparison groups). Some commenters also noted that, given the importance of food, it may be unethical to conduct trials that include a control or comparison group. The USPSTF reviews evidence from multiple, well-conducted studies to adequately determine the benefits and harms of preventive services. For this topic, the USPSTF also included nonrandomized studies and quasi-experimental studies in its review. The USPSTF understands the necessity of food and the complexities involved in conducting and evaluating studies on food insecurity. It is currently studying how to best address this and other types of social risk topics (see the Other Considerations section). Additionally, the USPSTF has a separate commentary addressing this challenging topic.<sup>37</sup></p>\r\n<p>Last, some commenters expressed concern that the I statement would be interpreted as a recommendation against screening or that interventions to address food insecurity are ineffective. The USPSTF wishes to clarify that the I statement is a determination that the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for food insecurity and is neither a recommendation for nor against screening. Clinicians should continue to use their clinical judgment to determine if screening is appropriate for individual patients.</p><h2>Other Considerations</h2><p>The USPSTF recognizes the important connection between a person&rsquo;s social and economic condition and their health and continues to explore how to best incorporate social needs into its recommendation process. Given the potential evidence base and the feasibility of primary care&ndash;based interventions, screening for food insecurity was chosen as an initial focus for a recommendation about a social risk. To assess the balance of benefits and harms, the USPSTF needs evidence that screening for food insecurity leads to health benefits. In the absence of this type of direct evidence, the USPSTF looks for evidence linking studies that show screening tests are accurate with evidence showing that interventions reduce food insecurity and improve health outcomes. However, as the USPSTF reviewed this topic, there were several aspects specific to screening for social risk that complicated its assessment of the balance of benefits and harms.</p>\r\n<p>First, there are limitations to food insecurity interventions that can be provided or referred from the primary care setting. As a social condition, food insecurity requires direct intervention on the social circumstances (ie, poverty) that cause it. Primary care&ndash;based and primary care&ndash;referrable interventions generally offer only limited &ldquo;treatment&rdquo; of food insecurity through interventions that provide access to community resources, or limited access to food without changing a person&rsquo;s social circumstance (eg, income).</p>\r\n<p>Second, addressing social risk factors in primary care may not have the same direct relationship with health outcomes that is seen with health-focused screenings or interventions. Social risk factors such as food insecurity rarely exist in isolation, and screening for or intervening in one social risk may not completely address the impact on health outcomes.</p>\r\n<p>Third, social determinants may also shape a patient&rsquo;s situation in a manner that affects their ability to effectively receive other clinical preventive or primary care services, indirectly affecting a variety of health outcomes. For example, a patient&rsquo;s food insecurity status may be important to identify when providing primary care management of diabetes, separately from providing resources for food insecurity directly. Identifying and addressing a social risk such as food insecurity in the primary care setting may also be necessary to help a patient attend to other preventive care needs.</p>\r\n<p>Fourth, social needs (factors with which patients would like assistance), as opposed to social risks identified by screening, may complicate the direct benefit of screening. For example, a clinician may identify a patient with food insecurity, but if the patient or clinician prioritizes other concerns, the effect of screening and subsequent interventions may be limited.<sup>6</sup></p>\r\n<p>Last, the USPSTF&rsquo;s determination was partly based on the small number of acceptable studies on the benefits and harms of food insecurity interventions in the primary care setting. It is reasonable, however, to recognize that providing adequate food and nutrition to individuals without consistent access to it due to poverty is a crucial component of overall health. Given these points, the USPSTF is further exploring how its established methods for assessing the benefits and harms of a preventive intervention can be most effectively used for food insecurity and perhaps other social determinants of health topics as well.</p><h2>Recommendations of Others</h2><p>Several organizations provide guidance on screening and interventions for food insecurity. The American Academy of Family Physicians recommends that family physicians use a social risk screening instrument that includes food insecurity.<sup>38</sup> The American Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics,<sup>39</sup> the American Academy of Pediatrics,<sup>40</sup> and the American Diabetes Association<sup>41</sup> suggest using the 2-item Hunger Vital Sign screening tool to assess the possibility of food insecurity. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association,<sup>42</sup> American College of Physicians,<sup>43</sup> and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists<sup>44</sup> recommend screening but do not endorse a specific screening tool. AARP has developed a resource guide and toolkit for implementing food insecurity screening and referral for older patients in primary care.<sup>45</sup></p>","topic":"Food Insecurity: Screening","keywords":"Food insecurity","pubDate":"2025-03-11","categories":["4"],"tool":["550"]},"897":{"topicType":"Counseling","topicYear":2025,"uspstfAlias":"breastfeeding-primary-care-interventions","specific":[2061],"title":"Breastfeeding: Primary Care Behavioral Counseling Interventions","pathwayToBenefit":"To achieve the benefits of breastfeeding interventions, it is important that evidence-based interventions are readily accessible for all patients.","rationale":"<h2>Importance</h2><p>The association between breastfeeding and health benefits in children has been previously well established;<sup>1</sup> health benefits have also been found for women who breastfeed.<sup>2</sup> However, breastfeeding rates in the US are relatively modest; as of 2021, 59.8% of infants at age 6 months are breastfed and 27.2% of infants at that age are exclusively breastfed.<sup>3</sup> Healthy People 2030 has set a goal to increase the proportion of infants who are breastfed exclusively through age 6 months to 42.4%<sup>4</sup> and the proportion of infants who are breastfed any amount at 1 year to 54.1%<sup>5</sup> Breastfeeding rates differ according to race, age, level of education, and other sociodemographic factors.<sup>3,6</sup> Variables associated with lower breastfeeding rates include Black race; being younger than 30 years; participating in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children; being unmarried; living in a nonmetropolitan area; or having high school as the highest education level achieved.<sup>3,6</sup> Disparities are present by race, with 73.9% of Asian infants, 51.7% of Black infants, 56.1% of Hispanic infants, and 63.4% of White infants being breastfed at 6 months.<sup>3</sup></p>\r\n<p>There are complex historical, structural, and economic factors that research has shown to contribute to disparities in rates of breastfeeding. Examples include lasting psychological impact and stigma of enslaved Black women being forced to act as wet nurses;<sup>7-10</sup> the marketing tactics of formula companies;<sup>11,12</sup> and societal messaging that emphasizes the use of breasts for sexual purposes rather than nutrition.<sup>8-10</sup> Studies have shown that Hispanic and Latina communities may have a perception that providing both breast milk and formula gives infants twice the benefits, which contributes to lower breastfeeding rates.<sup>13-15</sup> Research also has shown that Black and Hispanic and Latina individuals, as well as individuals with lower socioeconomic status, may work in jobs that make it difficult to continue breastfeeding while working.<sup>14,16-18</sup> For example, Black women often report returning to work early, at 6 to 8 weeks postpartum, which may make it more difficult to breastfeed their infants.<sup>9,16,19</sup></p>\r\n<p>Studies also have identified multiple factors that limit access to breastfeeding support. Zip codes that have higher proportions of Black residents are less likely to have birthing facilities with supportive breastfeeding practices, such as early initiation of breastfeeding, rooming in, limited use of breastfeeding supplements, limited use of pacifiers, and postdischarge support.<sup>20</sup> Additionally, in a large population study, Black, Hispanic, and Indigenous women reported higher rates of mistreatment by health care professionals during pregnancy, including having their preferences ignored.<sup>21</sup> Research has also documented that women belonging to racial and ethnic minorities may be less likely to receive breastfeeding support than White women.<sup>22-25</sup></p><h2>USPSTF Assessment of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h2><p>The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) concludes with moderate certainty that behavioral counseling interventions to support breastfeeding have a <strong>moderate net benefit</strong>.

Interventions to support breastfeeding may also involve partners, other family members, and friends. This recommendation does not apply in circumstances in which there are contraindications to breastfeeding (eg, certain maternal medical conditions or infant metabolic disorders, such as galactosemia). The USPSTF did not review evidence on interventions directed at breastfeeding of preterm infants.</p>\r\n<h3>Definitions of Breastfeeding</h3>\r\n<p>For the purposes of this recommendation statement, <em>breastfeeding</em> includes both feeding at the breast and feeding expressed breast milk through a bottle. Rates of breastfeeding are described in terms of <em>initiation</em> (starting breastfeeding or introducing breast milk, at or within 1 week after birth), <em>duration</em> (the number of months breastfeeding or consumption of breast milk lasts), and <em>exclusivity</em> (consumption of only breast milk, whether from the breast or bottle, and without other liquid or food supplementation).</p>\r\n<h3>Behavioral Counseling Interventions and Implementation Considerations</h3>\r\n<p>Behavioral counseling interventions that help increase breastfeeding rates include breastfeeding education and support. Breastfeeding education typically includes a formalized program to convey general breastfeeding knowledge and focuses on the benefits of breastfeeding, practical breastfeeding skills (eg, latching), and the management of common breastfeeding complications. These programs may also offer family members encouragement and advice on how to provide support. Breastfeeding support can include providing information about the benefits of breastfeeding, psychological support (encouragement, reassurance, and discussing questions and problems), and direct support during breastfeeding observations (helping with the positioning of the infant and observing latching). Interventions are often provided by professionals such as nurses, midwives, clinicians, or lactation care providers. Support may also be provided by trained peers. Interventions that occur over multiple periods (ie, during the prenatal, peripartum, and postpartum periods) tend to have greater effects compared with those that occur over a single period (just 1 trimester of pregnancy). Effective interventions have varied in terms of delivery setting&mdash;in person vs remote delivery (via video, telephone, or text), in-home visit vs in hospital or in medical office, and delivery to an individual vs a group.</p>\r\n<p>For women who decide to breastfeed their infant via expressed milk, health insurance plans must cover the cost of a breast pump.<sup>27</sup> Additionally, most employees covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act have the right to a reasonable break time and place to express breast milk while at work.<sup>28</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Additional Tools and Resources</h3>\r\n<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides information for families and public health programs (<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/php/about/index.html\">https://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/php/about/index.html</a>; <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/php/guidelines-recommendations/index.html\">https://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/php/guidelines-recommendations/index.html</a>) and on practices that support breastfeeding in maternity care settings (<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/php/guidelines-recommendations/safety-in-maternity-care.html\">https://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/php/guidelines-recommendations/safety-in-maternity-care.html</a>).</p>\r\n<p>The US Department of Labor provides a fact sheet on Fair Labor Standards Act protections for employees to pump breast milk at work (<a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fact-sheets/73-flsa-break-time-nursing-mothers\">https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fact-sheets/73-flsa-break-time-nursing-mothers</a>).</p>\r\n<p>The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health provides resources on how to support breastfeeding at work (<a href=\"https://womenshealth.gov/supporting-nursing-moms-work/resources\">https://womenshealth.gov/supporting-nursing-moms-work/resources</a>).</p>\r\n<p>Information on breast pumps and breastfeeding is available through the US Food and Drug Administration (<a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/consumers/womens-health-topics/pregnancy#Breast%20pumps%20and%20breastfeeding\">https://www.fda.gov/consumers/womens-health-topics/pregnancy#Breast%20pumps%20and%20breastfeeding</a>).</p>\r\n<p>The <em>Eunice Kennedy Shriver</em> National Institute of Child Health and Human Development provides educational materials on breastfeeding for patients and families (<a href=\"https://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/breastfeeding\">https://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/breastfeeding</a>).</p>\r\n<p>The US Department of Agriculture provides resources for breastfeeding support for women participating in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (<a href=\"https://wicbreastfeeding.fns.usda.gov/\">https://wicbreastfeeding.fns.usda.gov/</a>).</p>\r\n<p>The National Institutes of Health has created a drug and lactation database, LactMed, that contains information on drugs and other chemicals that may pass from breast milk to the infant (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK501922/\">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK501922/</a>).</p>\r\n<p>Additional resources on breastfeeding for maternal and child health professionals are available through the Health Resources and Services Administration&rsquo;s Maternal and Child Health Bureau (<a href=\"https://mchb.hrsa.gov/programs-impact/focus-areas/maternal-health/mchb-supports-breastfeeding\">https://mchb.hrsa.gov/programs-impact/focus-areas/maternal-health/mchb-supports-breastfeeding</a>).</p>","other":"<h2>Supporting Evidence</h2><h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF commissioned a systematic review<sup>29,30</sup> to evaluate the benefits and harms of behavioral counseling interventions to support breastfeeding in all adolescents and adults who are pregnant or postpartum. This is an update to a systematic review that was commissioned for the USPSTF in 2016. The updated review focused on interventions that were initiated in, conducted in, or referable from primary care.</p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Behavioral Counseling Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>Ninety trials representing data on more than 49,000 pregnant or postpartum women and their infants were reviewed.<sup>29,30</sup> Thirty-three of the trials were conducted in the US, 23 in Europe, 17 in Asia, 10 in Australia and New Zealand, and 7 in Canada.<sup>29,30</sup> The average age of study participants ranged from 16 to 33 years. The participants in the majority of the US-based studies (24/33) were predominantly Black and/or Hispanic and Latina women, including 6 studies that limited enrollment to Black women or Hispanic or Latina women.<sup>29,30</sup> Many of the US-based studies also required that participants have incomes in a lower income bracket to be able to enroll.<sup>29,30</sup> Almost half of the studies limited enrollment to women who were intending to breastfeed, and the majority of participants in the remaining studies intended to breastfeed at the beginning of the study.<sup>29,30</sup> Most of the studies delivered the intervention to individual participants, although 12 interventions included group sessions with other participants.<sup>29,30</sup> Trials varied widely in terms of when interventions were provided (prenatally, peripartum, or postpartum), who delivered the intervention (nurse, midwife, clinician, lactation care provider, or peer), and where the intervention was delivered (office, hospital, home, video, telephone, or text).<sup>29,30</sup> Few of the studies described whether interventions addressed use of expressed or donor breast milk. Few studies reported on the training and certification of lactation care providers. No studies reported outcomes by whether breastfeeding was at the breast vs through use of expressed or donor breast milk.</p>\r\n<p>All but 1 of the 90 trials reported prevalence of breastfeeding at some time point after the intervention, although the number of studies reporting at a given time point (initiation, &lt;3 months, 3 months to &lt;6 months, and 6 months) varied from 27 to 51 trials (N analyzed, 10,622 to 17,580).<sup>29,30</sup> Based on pooled analyses evaluating follow-up up to 6 months, there was a statistically significant increased prevalence of any breastfeeding and exclusive breastfeeding in the intervention group at all time points, except for initiation of any breastfeeding. Effect sizes ranged from a risk ratio of 1.06 (95% CI, 1.03-1.08; 47 trials [n = 15,663]) for any breastfeeding at less than 3 months to a risk ratio of 1.46 (95% CI, 1.20-1.78; 37 trials [n = 14,398]) for exclusive breastfeeding at 6 months. Overall, at any given time point, risk ratios for exclusive breastfeeding were higher than they were for any breastfeeding, indicating that interventions may have a greater role in increasing exclusive breastfeeding. Generally, intervention effectiveness did not vary by provider type (nurse, midwife, clinician, lactation care provider), intervention content, timing, or setting. Exploratory analyses suggest that interventions may be more effective in women who were not initially intending to breastfeed and if they take place over multiple periods (ie, prenatal, peripartum, or postpartum).</p>\r\n<p>A much smaller number of the included trials reported on the direct impact of the breastfeeding support intervention on infant health outcomes (10 trials [n = 6592]) or maternal health outcomes (9 trials [n = 2334]). Generally, the number of participants analyzed for each of these outcomes was much smaller, making it difficult to determine if any differences between control and intervention groups existed, since many of these analyses were underpowered. However, the association between breastfeeding and improved health outcomes in infants has been well established by observational studies.<sup>2</sup> A recent review of these studies<sup>2</sup> found that &ldquo;more&rdquo; vs &ldquo;less&rdquo; breastfeeding was associated with a lower risk of acute otitis media, asthma,<sup>31,32</sup> rapid weight gain and obesity,<sup>33-35</sup> childhood leukemia,<sup>36,37</sup> moderate to severe respiratory tract infections and gastrointestinal tract infections in infants,<sup>38</sup> allergic rhinitis,<sup>39</sup> malocclusion,<sup>40,41</sup> inflammatory bowel disease,<sup>42</sup> type 1 diabetes,<sup>43,44</sup> elevated blood pressure,<sup>45</sup> and infant mortality.<sup>46,47</sup> Although the evidence on improved health outcomes in women who breastfeed is less robust, breastfeeding has been associated with reduced risk for breast and epithelial ovarian cancer,<sup>48,49</sup> hypertension,<sup>49</sup> and type 2 diabetes.<sup>49,50</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Behavioral Counseling Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>Few trials (7 trials [n = 1404]) reported on harms of behavioral counseling interventions to support breastfeeding. Most reported no adverse events related to the intervention, although 1 trial reported greater feelings of anxiety and decreased confidence among participants in the intervention group. Twenty-two trials (n = 13,815) reported that participants in the intervention group experienced fewer breastfeeding problems or difficulties (such as mastitis or sore nipples or breasts), pointing to another potential benefit of these interventions.</p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comments</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from October 22 to November 18, 2024. Some comments requested that the recommendation include health system&ndash;level interventions. The USPSTF would like to clarify that it focuses on interventions that can be provided in primary care settings and has revised the title of the recommendation to make this clearer. Comments were also received asking for additional information on barriers to breastfeeding and for additional tools and resources on breastfeeding. Additional information has been added to the Importance section and the Practice Considerations section, as appropriate. Some commenters sought additional information on how interventions should be provided (eg, who should provide them and when). A high-level summary of intervention characteristics is provided in the Behavioral Counseling Interventions and Implementation Considerations section. No specific intervention provider type or intervention content, timing, or setting was found to be more effective. Further details of characteristics of individual interventions can be found in the accompanying evidence report.<sup>29,30</sup> A few commenters expressed concern that limiting the evidence base to randomized clinical trials was overly restrictive. The USPSTF follows consistent methodology on how it reviews and assesses the evidence for all its recommendations (see the USPSTF Procedure Manual<sup>26</sup>). Following that methodology, the USPSTF did find adequate evidence on the benefits and harms of primary care interventions to support breastfeeding.</p><h2>Research Needs and Gaps</h2><p>See <a href=\"#tab2\">Table 2</a> for research needs and gaps related to primary care behavioral counseling interventions to support breastfeeding.</p><h2>Recommendations of Others</h2><p>Several organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics,<sup>51</sup> the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,<sup>52</sup> the American Academy of Family Physicians,<sup>53</sup> the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine,<sup>54</sup> and the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans,<sup>55</sup> recommend exclusive breastfeeding for approximately the first 6 months, followed by introduction of complementary foods and continued breastfeeding as long as mutually desired. Generally, these organizations also state that breastfeeding beyond the first<sup>53,55</sup> or second<sup>51,52</sup> year offers health benefits.</p><h2>Table 2.

The <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (Fifth Edition) recognizes 7 different types of anxiety disorders in children and adolescents: generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, agoraphobia, specific phobias, separation anxiety disorder, and selective mutism.<sup>2</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>\r\n<p>Risk factors for anxiety disorders include genetic, personality, and environmental factors, such as attachment difficulties, interparental conflict, parental overprotection, early parental separation, and child maltreatment. Demographic factors such as poverty and low socioeconomic status are also associated with higher rates of anxiety disorders.<sup>1,3,6-13</sup> The National Survey on LGBTQ Youth Mental Health reported that 72% of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer youth and 77% of transgender and nonbinary youth described GAD symptoms.<sup>14</sup> According to the 2016 NSCH, anxiety conditions were most common in older children and adolescents (aged 12 to 17 years) compared with younger children (11 years or younger).<sup>15</sup></p>\r\n<p>Previous studies suggested that Black youth may have lower rates of mental health disorders compared with White youth. The 2016 NSCH also found that anxiety conditions were more common in non-Hispanic White children compared with children of other racial or ethnic backgrounds.<sup>15</sup> However, recent cohorts of Black children or adolescents have reported a higher prevalence of anxiety disorders than in the past.<sup>16</sup> Multiple factors, ranging from socioeconomic status, childhood adversity, family structure, and neighborhood effects, may influence patterns of prevalence by race or ethnicity.<sup>1,3</sup> Adverse childhood experiences influence the likelihood of experiencing mental health conditions such as anxiety. Adverse childhood experiences may result from a complex interaction of familial, peer, or societal factors, including racial discrimination. These adverse childhood experiences may be blatant or subtle (eg, microaggressions) but are potentially traumatic events that, in the context of historic trauma, structural racism, and biopsychological vulnerability, can worsen mental health outcomes.<sup>1,3,17</sup> Combined with lower engagement with mental health services, adverse childhood experiences can result in high levels of unmet mental health needs in Black youth.<sup>1,3,18-22</sup> Similar patterns of historic trauma, adverse childhood experiences, and substance abuse may also explain higher rates of mental health disorders in Native American/Alaska Native youth.<sup>1,3</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>Anxiety screening instruments that have been assessed by the USPSTF are heterogeneous. Some screening instruments are designed to assess for a specific anxiety disorder (eg, the Social Phobia and Anxiety Inventory for Children, which screens for social phobia and anxiety disorder), while others are designed to assess several anxiety disorders. Broader screening instruments used to identify children with several different anxiety disorders include the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders (SCARED) (global anxiety and any anxiety disorder) and the Patient Health Questionnaire&ndash;Adolescent (GAD and panic disorder).</p>\r\n<p>Many instruments that screen for anxiety were initially developed for epidemiologic studies for surveillance or to evaluate response to treatment. Not all of the screening instruments are feasible for use in primary care settings because of length.<sup>1,3</sup> Currently, only 2 screening instruments are widely used in clinical practice for detecting anxiety: SCARED and Social Phobia Inventory.</p>\r\n<p>Anxiety screening tools alone are not sufficient to diagnose anxiety. If the screening test is positive for anxiety, a confirmatory diagnostic assessment and follow-up is required.</p>\r\n<h3>Screening Intervals</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no evidence on appropriate or recommended screening intervals, and the optimal interval is unknown. Repeated screening may be most productive in adolescents with risk factors for anxiety. Opportunistic screening may be appropriate for adolescents, who may have infrequent health care visits.</p>\r\n<h3>Treatment or Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>Treatment for anxiety disorders can include psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, a combination of both, or collaborative care.<sup>15</sup> Several psychotherapy approaches have been used to treat anxiety; however, cognitive behavioral therapy is the most commonly used approach.<sup>16-18</sup> Duloxetine, a serotonin&ndash;norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, is the only medication approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of GAD in children 7 years or older. Other medications have also been reported as being prescribed off-label for treatment of anxiety in youth.<sup>1,3</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Additional Tools and Resources</h3>\r\n<p>The Community Preventive Services Task Force recommends targeted school-based cognitive behavioral therapy programs to reduce depression and anxiety symptoms (<a href=\"https://www.thecommunityguide.org/findings/mental-health-targeted-school-based-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-programs-reduce-depression-anxiety-symptoms\">https://www.thecommunityguide.org/findings/mental-health-targeted-school-based-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-programs-reduce-depression-anxiety-symptoms</a>).</p>\r\n<p>The Community Preventive Services Task Force recommends individual cognitive behavioral therapy for symptomatic youth who have been exposed to traumatic events, based on strong evidence of effectiveness in reducing psychological harm (<a href=\"https://www.thecommunityguide.org/findings/violence-psychological-harm-traumatic-events-among-children-and-adolescents-cognitive-individual\">https://www.thecommunityguide.org/findings/violence-psychological-harm-traumatic-events-among-children-and-adolescents-cognitive-individual</a>).</p>\r\n<p>The Community Preventive Services Task Force recommends group cognitive behavioral therapy for symptomatic youth who have been exposed to traumatic events, based on strong evidence of effectiveness in reducing psychological harm (<a href=\"https://www.thecommunityguide.org/findings/violence-psychological-harm-traumatic-events-among-children-and-adolescents-cognitive-group\">https://www.thecommunityguide.org/findings/violence-psychological-harm-traumatic-events-among-children-and-adolescents-cognitive-group</a>).</p>\r\n<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has additional information on anxiety in childhood (<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/childrensmentalhealth/depression.html\">https://www.cdc.gov/childrensmentalhealth/depression.html</a>).</p>\r\n<h3>Implementation</h3>\r\n<p>Various questionnaires have been evaluated as screening tools for anxiety in children and adolescents. Some may target specific anxiety disorders, while others may screen for various disorders. The length of questionnaires can also vary. Clinicians are encouraged to consider which anxiety disorders may be most common in their practice and which screening tools may be most feasible to use in their practice settings. For patients to benefit from screening, positive screening results should be confirmed by diagnostic assessment and patients should be linked with appropriate care.</p>\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>\r\n<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>\r\n<p>Developing an anxiety disorder during childhood or adolescence increases the likelihood of a future anxiety disorder (the same disorder or another anxiety disorder) or secondary depression.<sup>19-22</sup> These mental health conditions have long-term effects that may include chronic mental and physical or somatic health conditions, psychosocial functional impairment, increased risk for substance abuse, and premature mortality.<sup>23-26</sup> Anxiety problems are more common in older children (aged 12 to 17 years) compared with younger children (aged 3 to 11 years).<sup>15</sup> Separation anxiety, selective mutism, and GAD tend to appear earlier in childhood (preschool and early school years), whereas social anxiety and specific phobias generally appear in later school years.<sup>1,3</sup> Although younger children may experience anxiety, limited evidence was available on accuracy of screening questionnaires and effectiveness of anxiety treatments in younger children.</p>\r\n<h4>Potential Harms</h4>\r\n<p>Potential harms of screening questionnaires include false-positive screening results that lead to unnecessary referrals (and associated time and economic burden), treatment, labeling, anxiety, and stigma. Pharmacologic interventions may result in adverse events, while psychological interventions are likely to have minimal harms.<sup>1,3</sup> Evidence on harms of screening and treatment in younger age groups is limited.</p>\r\n<h4>Current Practice</h4>\r\n<p>Evidence is limited on the implementation of routine mental health screening in the US. A survey of primary care physicians found that 76% reported believing in the importance of talking to adolescent patients about their mental health; however, only 46% said that they always asked their patients about their mental health.<sup>27</sup> Information on screening for anxiety in younger children is lacking.</p>\r\n<h3>Other Related USPSTF Recommendations</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF has recommendations on mental health topics pertaining to children and adolescents, including screening for depression,<sup>28</sup> suicide risk,<sup>28</sup> and illicit drug<sup>29</sup> and alcohol<sup>30</sup> use.</p>","other":"<h2>Recommendations of Others</h2><p>The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry states that freely available general social-emotional screening instruments can be deployed systematically to standardize identification of anxiety concerns in primary care, school, or other child-serving settings. Early identification of an anxiety concern, if confirmed as a problem on follow-up assessment, can facilitate early intervention.<sup>31</sup> The American Academy of Pediatrics and Bright Futures recommends annual screening for behavioral, social, and emotional problems (including anxiety in children and adolescents) in patients from birth to age 21 years.<sup>32</sup> The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that all adolescents should be screened for any mental health disorder in a confidential setting during preventive care visits (if allowed by local laws).<sup>33</sup></p>","discussion":"<h2>Supporting Evidence</h2><h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF commissioned a systematic review<sup>1,3</sup> to evaluate the benefits and harms of screening for anxiety disorders in children and adolescents. The USPSTF has not previously made a recommendation on this topic. Conditions that are no longer included as part of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (Fifth Edition) anxiety disorders (such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, acute stress disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder) were not a focus of this review.</p>\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>Ten fair-quality studies (n = 3260) evaluated accuracy of screening instruments. Most studies included primarily adolescents (aged 12 to 18 years; mean age, 14.8 years); 4 studies included children as young as 7 years (mean age, 10.5 years). There were no studies that included children younger than 7 years, and there is limited evidence available on screening accuracy for the anxiety conditions that are more common in younger children. One study of children and adolescents with social anxiety disorder provided data separately for children aged 8 to 12 years and adolescents aged 13 to 17 years, with similar results in both age groups.<sup>1,3</sup> In studies that reported sex, the percentage of female participants ranged from 43% to 63%. Four studies reported race or ethnicity, with the percentage of youth from underrepresented groups ranging from 1% to 58%.</p>\r\n<p>Studies used 12 screening instruments to screen for 6 anxiety conditions (global anxiety, GAD, panic disorder, separation anxiety, social anxiety disorder, and any anxiety disorder). Some screening instruments with subscales screened for more than 1 anxiety disorder. Only 1 or 2 studies used each screening instrument for a given disorder. Although a variety of different screening instruments were assessed, 2 are widely used in practice for detecting anxiety: SCARED and the Social Phobia Inventory. The reference standard was a structured clinical interview for anxiety diagnosis.<sup>1,3</sup></p>\r\n<p>Screening accuracy varied by condition screened for and specific screening test and threshold used. For example, sensitivity for detection of GAD ranged from 0.50 to 0.88 and specificity ranged from 0.63 to 0.98 (based on 3 studies). For social anxiety disorder, the ranges were narrower, with a sensitivity ranging from 0.67 to 0.93 and specificity ranging from 0.69 to 0.94; 4 of 5 studies found a sensitivity of 0.78 or greater and a specificity of 0.74 or greater. Across all of the screening instruments and subscales and thresholds for a positive test evaluated, sensitivity ranged between 0.34 and 1.00; specificity ranged between 0.47 and 0.99. Confidence intervals were wide and imprecise. The number of false-positive results also varied. For example, false-positive results per 1000 persons screened ranged from 17 to 361 for GAD and from 104 to 254 for social anxiety disorder.<sup>1,3</sup> No additional analyses were available on populations by age, sex, or race or ethnicity.<sup>1,3</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no studies that directly evaluated the benefits of screening for anxiety disorders. The evidence on screening for anxiety in children and adolescents relies on linking indirect evidence on the accuracy of screening and the benefits of treatment. There were 29 good- or fair-quality randomized clinical trials (RCTs) on anxiety treatment (n = 2805); 22 trials assessed cognitive behavioral therapy, 6 trials assessed pharmacotherapy (sertraline and fluoxetine were most commonly studied but other medications included fluvoxamine, escitalopram, and duloxetine), and 1 trial evaluated both cognitive behavioral therapy and pharmacotherapy and combinations thereof. Three studies included young children aged 3 to 7 years, 4 studies included adolescents aged 13 to 20 years, and 22 studies focused on older children (aged 6 to 14 years [11 studies]) or children and adolescents (aged 5 to 18 years [11 studies]).<sup>1,3</sup> Most trials enrolled children and adolescents with any anxiety disorder, but a small number of trials focused on a specific anxiety diagnosis. Studies recruited participants from multiple countries, including the US, Mexico, South Africa, Australia, the UK, Denmark, Germany, Norway, Hong Kong, Japan, Spain, and Sweden.<sup>1,3</sup> Nine of the 29 studies had a majority of male participants. Eighteen studies had a majority of White patients enrolled.<sup>1,3</sup></p>\r\n<p>The most common primary diagnoses in these trials were social anxiety disorder and GAD. Most anxiety trials recruited using referrals from community or school settings (17 trials, n = 1199), with another 10 trials (n = 846) including referrals from specialist mental health settings. The USPSTF concluded that the community or school settings in which most participants were recruited from were similar to those of patients followed up in primary care settings and determined that the treatment benefits would be applicable to screen-detected asymptomatic patients.<sup>1,3</sup></p>\r\n<p>Cognitive behavioral therapy was associated with improvement in anxiety outcomes across several pooled measures: treatment response (pooled relative risk [RR], 1.89 [95% CI, 1.17 to 3.05]; n = 606; 6 trials; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 64%), disease remission (RR, 2.68 [95% CI, 1.48 to 4.88]; n = 321; 4 trials; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 48%), and loss of diagnosis (RR range, 3.02 to 3.09), compared with usual care or wait-list. The evidence on improved functioning with cognitive behavioral therapy in participants with any anxiety was inconsistent.</p>\r\n<p>The evidence on pharmacotherapy compared with placebo was associated with an increased improvement in symptoms and response on the Clinical Global Impressions&ndash;Improvement Scale (scores of 1 or 2; RR, 2.11 [95% CI, 1.58 to 2.98]; n = 370; 5 trials; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em><sup> </sup>= 18%) but was inconsistent on measures of functioning.<sup>1,3</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Screening and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no studies that directly evaluated the evidence on the harms of screening for anxiety disorders. The evidence on harms of screening for anxiety in children and adolescents relies on linking indirect evidence on the harms of inaccurate screening test results and the harms of treatment.</p>\r\n<p>Eleven RCTs (n = 1293) on treatment of anxiety in children and adolescents addressed harms. The evidence from cognitive behavioral therapy trials demonstrated inconsistent results on suicide-related events. These trials also showed lower rates of withdrawal due to adverse events and serious adverse events in the cognitive behavioral therapy groups. One study evaluated homicidal ideation but showed no pattern with cognitive behavioral therapy.</p>\r\n<p>Pharmacotherapy studies on duloxetine, escitalopram, and sertraline reported some harms such as more suicide-related events, psychiatric adverse events, and withdrawals due to adverse events; however, these events were rare and not statistically significant. No pattern for homicidal ideation was seen in a single study of pharmacotherapy.<sup>1,3</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from April 12, 2022, to May 9, 2022. In response to comments, the USPSTF provided additional information about participant characteristics of included studies in the Supporting Evidence section. The USPSTF also clarified that this recommendation does not apply to children and adolescents with diagnosed anxiety or who are showing recognized signs or symptoms of anxiety in the Patient Population Under Consideration section. Some comments inquired about additional screening tools, such as the Revised Children&rsquo;s Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS-25), the Spence Children&rsquo;s Anxiety Scale (SCAS), and Pediatric Symptom Checklist (PSC). These other instruments were not included in the review because the USPSTF did not identify any eligible studies of these instruments as screening tools. Some comments asked, given the high rates of comorbidity between anxiety and depression, whether a positive anxiety screening result should prompt a screening for depression and suicide risk. The USPSTF did not evaluate the evidence on this screening approach, so it is not addressed by this recommendation statement.</p><h2>Research Needs and Gaps</h2><p>There are several critical evidence gaps.

This recommendation does not apply to pregnant persons who are severely malnourished, have symptoms of iron deficiency or iron deficiency anemia, or have specific hematologic conditions (eg, sickle cell anemia) or nutritional deficiencies that may increase their need for iron.</p>\r\n<h3>Definitions</h3>\r\n<p>Iron is necessary for production of hemoglobin, an essential protein in blood required to transport oxygen throughout the body. Iron is also necessary for the production of additional proteins that are vital to various metabolic pathways.<sup>4</sup> Iron deficiency refers to depletion of iron stores and may progress to iron deficiency anemia.<sup>1</sup> Increased demands for iron during pregnancy enhances vulnerability to iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia.<sup>1</sup> While iron deficiency is a leading cause of anemia, other conditions may also cause anemia. Screening for iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia often includes measurement of hematologic indices (eg, hemoglobin level or hematocrit as proxies of iron deficiency anemia), and an abnormal screening test result may be followed by treatment with iron therapy.<sup>1</sup> To establish the presence of iron deficiency or iron deficiency anemia, levels of iron biomarkers (eg, ferritin) may be measured, although there is no consensus on the exact ferritin level that is indicative of iron deficiency.<sup>1</sup> Supplementation refers to routine provision of low-dose supplemental iron or intake of iron-fortified foods without specifically measuring hematologic indices.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statements</h3>\r\n<p>In deciding whether to screen or supplement for iron deficiency with or without anemia during pregnancy, clinicians caring for pregnant persons should consider the following.</p>\r\n<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>\r\n<p>The overall prevalence of iron deficiency anemia is uncertain due to the absence of universally accepted cutoffs in surveillance systems, older data, and use of hematologic indices as proxies rather than iron biomarkers to assess iron deficiency.<sup>2,5</sup> It is known, however, that the prevalence increases through pregnancy.<sup>1</sup> Based on recent survey data, Black and Mexican American pregnant persons are disproportionately affected by iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy, with social determinants of health as possible contributors to these disparities.<sup>1,2</sup> However, factors such as nutritional status, food insecurity, or access to health care were not reported in the survey data.<sup>1,2</sup></p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found limited evidence on current methods, including questionnaires and risk prediction tools, to identify pregnant persons at increased risk for iron deficiency with or without anemia. Commonly cited risk factors include a diet low in iron-rich foods (eg, vegan diet with inadequate sources of iron), gastrointestinal conditions or medications that can decrease iron absorption (eg, antacids), or a short interval between pregnancies.<sup>1</sup> Tobacco use and living at a high altitude may affect hematologic indices and interpretation of test results due to increases in hematocrit and hemoglobin values.<sup>1</sup> The evidence review identified 3 studies reporting strategies to predict iron deficiency or iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy.<sup>1</sup> Generally, in all 3 studies,<sup>6-8</sup> evidence was insufficient to evaluate the accuracy of risk prediction tools.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Potential Harms</h4>\r\n<p>Potential screening approaches to identify asymptomatic pregnant persons with iron deficiency or iron deficiency anemia are unlikely to cause serious harms, but evidence is limited. For example, reviewed evidence did not report risk of iron overload.<sup>1</sup> Common adverse effects of iron supplementation or treatment include gastrointestinal tract symptoms such as nausea, constipation, abdominal pain, and vomiting.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Current Practice</h4>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found limited evidence on current practices of screening and supplementation to prevent adverse maternal or infant health outcomes from iron deficiency or iron deficiency anemia. Clinical practice guidelines on screening and supplementation vary (see the Recommendations of Others section for additional information).<sup>1,9</sup> However, screening and supplementation are common. For screening, a surveillance report among Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) participants reported that more than one-half of enrolled pregnant persons (53%) underwent hemoglobin testing during their first trimester in 2018.<sup>1,10</sup> There may be other reasons that clinicians measure hematologic indices, such as to prepare for cesarean delivery or anticipated blood loss during delivery. There is evidence for racial and ethnic disparities in screening rates. In a US study<sup>11</sup> (n = 268,594) of Medicaid recipients across 4 states, Asian/Pacific Islander, Black, and Hispanic participants were less likely to receive a complete blood cell count in 3 of 4 states surveyed compared with White participants (raw odds ratios [ORs], 0.51 to 0.92).<sup>1</sup> For supplementation, according to NHANES data from 1996 to 2006, many pregnant persons (77%) reported using a supplement, often containing iron, within the previous 30 days.<sup>1,12</sup> Use of iron supplements may differ by race, geography, and social factors.<sup>1</sup> For example, in a study using NHANES survey data from 1999 to 2010, pregnant persons who were food insecure had lower mean iron intake from supplements compared with pregnant persons who were food secure.<sup>1,13</sup> Pregnant persons may be screened (eg, with measurement of hematologic indices in the first trimester) and supplemented (eg, with prenatal vitamins) concurrently.</p>\r\n<h3>Additional Tools and Resources</h3>\r\n<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention includes resources on perinatal quality collaboratives (<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/maternal-infant-health/pqc/index.html\">https://www.cdc.gov/maternal-infant-health/pqc/index.html</a>), including state collaborative toolkits, such as the California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative toolkit on improving the health care response to obstetric hemorrhage (<a href=\"https://www.cmqcc.org/resources-tool-kits/toolkits/ob-hemorrhage-toolkit\">https://www.cmqcc.org/resources-tool-kits/toolkits/ob-hemorrhage-toolkit</a>).</p>\r\n<p>The National Institutes of Health&rsquo;s Office of Dietary Supplements provides a fact sheet on iron for consumers in English (<a href=\"https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Iron-Consumer/\">https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Iron-Consumer/</a>) and Spanish (<a href=\"https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Iron-DatosEnEspanol/\">https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Iron-DatosEnEspanol/</a>) and for clinicians (<a href=\"https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Iron-HealthProfessional/\">https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Iron-HealthProfessional/</a>).</p>\r\n<p>The US Department of Health and Human Services&rsquo; Office on Women&rsquo;s Health provides a fact sheet about iron deficiency anemia for patients (<a href=\"https://www.womenshealth.gov/a-z-topics/iron-deficiency-anemia\">https://www.womenshealth.gov/a-z-topics/iron-deficiency-anemia</a>).</p>\r\n<h3>Other Related USPSTF Recommendations</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF has issued separate recommendations on screening for iron deficiency anemia in children aged 6 to 24 months<sup>14</sup> and folic acid supplementation to prevent neural tube defects in persons who plan to or could become pregnant.<sup>15</sup></p><h2>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h2><p>This recommendation is consistent with the 2015 recommendation statement on screening and supplementation for iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy. In 2015, the USPSTF concluded that the current evidence was insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women to prevent adverse maternal health and birth outcomes (I statement).<sup>16</sup> The USPSTF also concluded that the current evidence was insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of routine iron supplementation for iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women to prevent adverse maternal health and birth outcomes (I statement).<sup>16</sup></p>","other":"<h2>Supporting Evidence</h2><h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF commissioned a systematic review<sup>1,17</sup> to update its 2015 recommendation on screening and supplementation for iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy. In this current recommendation, the USPSTF broadened its review to include iron deficiency <em>without</em> anemia; it reviewed evidence on the benefits and harms of screening and supplementation for iron deficiency with and without anemia on maternal and infant health outcomes in asymptomatic pregnant persons. To assist with efforts to generalize the evidence to an asymptomatic US pregnant population, the USPSTF considered studies conducted in settings similar to the US (ie, categorized as &ldquo;high&rdquo; or &ldquo;very high&rdquo; on the United Nations Human Development Index). In addition, to address critical gaps in the evidence identified in 2015,<sup>18</sup> the USPSTF sought evidence on the association between change in maternal iron status and improvement in infant and maternal outcomes in pregnant persons with iron deficiency with or without anemia. Eligible study designs for the review included randomized clinical trials (RCTs), controlled observational studies, and large uncontrolled observational studies on harms.<sup>1,17</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Screening (Early Detection) and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The review found no evidence on the benefits of screening and treatment for screen-detected iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy on maternal and infant health outcomes.<sup>1,17</sup> A single observational study addressed the association between change in maternal iron status in pregnant persons with iron deficiency with or without anemia and clinical outcomes.<sup>1,17</sup> In the study<sup>19</sup> (n = 20,690) in pregnant persons responding to treatment (defined as persons with a normal hemoglobin value at delivery who reported taking iron supplementation), therapy was associated with reduction in the odds of preeclampsia (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.75 [95% CI, 0.61-0.91]) and preterm birth (adjusted OR, 0.59 [95% CI, 0.47-0.72]) compared with persons without anemia.<sup>1,17,19</sup> Nonresponse to therapy or untreated anemia was also associated with increased risk of preterm birth and preeclampsia (adjusted OR, 1.44 [95% CI, 1.16-1.76] and 1.45 [95% CI, 1.26-1.67], respectively) compared with no anemia.<sup>1,17,19</sup> Comparison on these outcomes between pregnant persons taking iron therapy (whether or not successfully treated) with persons not taking iron therapy was not reported, limiting assessment of the association between iron therapy and improvement in health outcomes.<sup>1,17</sup> Additional limitations to generalizing the study&rsquo;s findings included the definition of anemia (based on reported iron intake) and unclear or unreported iron dose, timing, and therapy duration.<sup>1,17</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Supplementation</h3>\r\n<h4>Maternal Health Outcomes</h4>\r\n<p>The review identified 16 studies comparing the effects of routine iron supplementation with no supplementation during pregnancy.<sup>1,17</sup> Timing of starting supplementation varied across studies, from the first prenatal visit to 20 weeks&rsquo; gestation, and continued to delivery.<sup>1,17</sup> Across the 16 studies, evidence on the effects of iron supplementation during pregnancy on maternal or infant health outcomes was limited, inconsistent, or without clear benefit.<sup>1,17</sup> One trial (n = 430) reported no differences in maternal quality of life (across 8 health concepts) with iron supplementation compared with placebo.<sup>1,17,20</sup> Five trials<sup>21-25</sup> (n = 13,610) found no statistically significant differences on rates of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy with iron supplementation compared with placebo or no iron (4.7% vs 3.1% [pooled, weighted rates];

Some comments agreed with the draft recommendation. In response to comments, the USPSTF added language on iron-rich foods for supplementation, limitations of interpreting prevalence of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia, and additional information on screening and supplementation in the Recommendation of Others section. Some comments requested tools to identify potential risk factors for iron deficiency, such as food insecurity and social instability, to assist clinicians in determining which pregnant persons could benefit from screening. Despite careful review, the USPSTF found limited evidence on approaches (such as questionnaires or risk prediction tools) to identify pregnant persons at increased risk for iron deficiency with or without anemia.</p>\r\n<p>Some comments expressed that the current I statements could be misinterpreted as recommendations against screening and supplementation. Others noted that the evidence was limited to RCTs and did not include clinically relevant health outcomes. In response, the USPSTF would like to reiterate that it is not making a recommendation for or against screening or supplementation during pregnancy for iron deficiency without or without anemia. Rather, the I statement is a call for more research on the benefits and harms of screening and supplementation. Further, the USPSTF carefully considers benefits and harms and makes recommendations when supported by sufficient evidence. The USPSTF cast a broad net, as outlined in the final research plan, including evidence from RCTs, controlled cohort studies, and other controlled observational studies. Some key questions also considered large uncontrolled observational studies and association studies. Clinically relevant potential outcomes included, but were not limited to, maternal health-related quality of life, postpartum hemorrhage, blood transfusions, and postpartum depression. The USPSTF continues to call for high-quality research, particularly on the critical gap of the association between changes in maternal iron status and improvement in infant and maternal outcomes in pregnant persons.</p><h2>Research Needs and Gaps</h2><p>See <a href=\"#tab2\">Table 2</a> for research needs and gaps related to screening and supplementation for iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy.</p><h2>Recommendations of Others</h2><p>For screening, recommendations generally focus on screening for anemia, rather than iron deficiency, and use variable cutoffs to define anemia. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), American Academy of Family Physicians, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that all pregnant persons be screened for anemia at their first prenatal visit, preferably during the first trimester of pregnancy.<sup>44-46</sup> ACOG recommends repeat screening at 24 to 28 weeks of gestation.<sup>44</sup></p>\r\n<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends universal supplementation for all pregnant persons with an oral low-dose iron supplement (30 mg/d).<sup>46</sup> ACOG recommends universal supplementation with low-dose iron during pregnancy except in the setting of certain conditions such as hemochromatosis.<sup>44</sup> It recommends evaluation for pregnant women who meet criteria for anemia to determine the cause, followed by treatment with low-dose supplemental iron for those with iron deficiency anemia along with prenatal vitamins.<sup>44</sup> The US Department of Agriculture and US Department of Health and Human Services&rsquo; &ldquo;Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025&rdquo; recommends that pregnant women or women planning to become pregnant take a supplement with iron when recommended by a clinician.<sup>47</sup> In addition, women following a vegetarian or vegan dietary pattern should discuss with a clinician whether supplementation of iron, vitamin B12, other nutrients, or some combination thereof is needed.<sup>47</sup></p><h2>Table 2.

Increasing age is strongly related to risk for falls. Other risk factors include cognitive and sensory deficits, presence of acute or chronic medical conditions, use of specific medications that can increase fall risk, environmental or occupational hazards, home or neighborhood features, and alcohol or drug use.<sup>4</sup> Intervention studies have most commonly used a history of falls to identify increased risk for future falls; studies also considered a history of falls together with other key risk factors, particularly impairments in mobility, gait, and balance.<sup>4</sup> A pragmatic approach to identifying persons at increased risk for falls would be to assess for a history of falls or for problems in physical functioning and limited mobility.</p>\r\n<h3>Treatment or Intervention</h3>\r\n<p>Effective exercise interventions include supervised individual physical therapy and group exercise classes, although most studies reviewed by the USPSTF included group exercise. It is difficult to identify specific components of exercise that are particularly effective. The most commonly studied exercise components were gait, balance, and functional training, followed by strength and resistance training, flexibility, and endurance training. A smaller number of trials included a 3-dimensional exercise (ie, exercise that involves movement through all 3 spatial planes or dimensions: forward and back, side to side, and up and down), such as group dance or tai chi classes. The most common frequency and duration for exercise interventions was 2 to 3 sessions per week for 12 months, although duration of exercise interventions ranged from 2 to 30 months.<sup>4</sup></p>\r\n<p>It is important to note that physical activity is associated with multiple health benefits in addition to fall prevention. For example, regular physical activity has been associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease events, cardiovascular disease mortality, and all-cause mortality, as well as lower blood pressure, lower risk of type 2 diabetes, and lower risk of dyslipidemia.<sup>5-7</sup> The US Department of Health and Human Services recommends that adults do at least 150 to 300 minutes per week of moderate-intensity, or 75 to 150 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, as well as muscle-strengthening activities of moderate or greater intensity and that involve all major muscle groups twice a week or more.<sup>5</sup></p>\r\n<p>Multifactorial interventions include an initial assessment of modifiable risk factors for falls and subsequent customized interventions for each patient based on issues identified in the initial assessment. The initial assessment could include a multidisciplinary comprehensive geriatric assessment or an assessment using a combination of various components, such as balance, gait, vision, postural blood pressure, medication, environment, cognition, and psychological health. This comprehensive assessment should be distinguished from the evaluation and treatment of a patient who presents with a specific symptom or concern (eg, reduced vision or lower extremity pain or numbness). In studies, assessments were conducted by nursing professionals, physicians, or physical or occupational therapists, and a variety of different professionals performed subsequent interventions, including nurses, clinicians, physical therapists, exercise instructors, occupational therapists, dietitians, or nutritionists. Intervention components vary based on the initial assessment and could include group or individual exercise, psychological interventions (eg, cognitive behavioral therapy), nutrition therapy, education, medication management, urinary incontinence management, environmental modification, physical or occupational therapy, social or community services, and referral to specialists (eg, ophthalmologist, neurologist, or cardiologist).<sup>4</sup></p>\r\n<p>The following interventions were reviewed by the USPSTF but lack sufficient evidence to assess their benefits and harms in preventing falls in community-dwelling older adults when offered alone and not in the context of a multifactorial intervention: environmental modification, medication management, psychological interventions, education interventions, and combination interventions (exercise plus environment interventions or exercise plus education interventions).<sup>4</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Additional Tools and Resources</h3>\r\n<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has guides on fall prevention interventions (<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/falls/interventions/?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/falls/programs/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.cdc.gov/falls/interventions/?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/falls/programs/index.html</a>).</p>\r\n<p>The CDC STEADI (Stopping Elderly Accidents, Death, and Injuries) initiative helps reduce fall risk among older patients (<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/steadi/index.html\">https://www.cdc.gov/steadi/index.html</a>).</p>\r\n<p>The National Institutes of Health provides information on falls and fall prevention (<a href=\"https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/falls-and-falls-prevention\">https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/falls-and-falls-prevention</a>).</p>\r\n<h3>Other Related USPSTF Recommendations</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF recommends screening for osteoporosis with bone measurement testing to prevent osteoporotic fractures in women 65 years or older and in postmenopausal women younger than 65 years who are at increased risk of osteoporosis.<sup>8</sup> The USPSTF also recommends against daily supplementation with 400 IU or less of vitamin D and 1000 mg or less of calcium for the primary prevention of fractures in postmenopausal women. The USPSTF has concluded that the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of the benefits and harms of daily supplementation with doses greater than 400 IU of vitamin D and greater than 1000 mg of calcium for the primary prevention of fractures in postmenopausal women and that the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of the benefits and harms of vitamin D and calcium supplementation, alone or in combination, for the primary prevention of fractures in men and premenopausal women.<sup>9</sup></p><h2>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h2><p>This recommendation replaces the 2018 USPSTF recommendation on interventions to prevent falls in community-dwelling older adults. In 2018, the USPSTF recommended exercise interventions to prevent falls in community-dwelling adults 65 years or older who are at increased risk for falls and that clinicians selectively offer multifactorial interventions to prevent falls to community-dwelling adults 65 years or older who are at increased risk for falls. The USPSTF also recommended against vitamin D supplementation to prevent falls in community-dwelling adults 65 years or older.<sup>10</sup> The current recommendation does not address the use of vitamin D to prevent falls; this evidence will be reviewed in a separate USPSTF recommendation (in progress). This recommendation is otherwise consistent with the 2018 USPSTF recommendation.</p>","other":"<h2>Supporting Evidence</h2><h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF commissioned a systematic evidence review on the effectiveness and harms of primary care&ndash;relevant interventions to prevent falls and fall-related morbidity and mortality in community-dwelling adults 65 years or older.<sup>4,11</sup> Studies conducted solely in populations with specific medical diagnoses for which interventions could be considered disease management (eg, moderate to severe neurocognitive disorders or Parkinson disease) were excluded. This review updates the 2018 review and varies from the previous review in that studies of vitamin D supplementation to prevent falls were not included; this intervention will be included in a separate review and recommendation (in progress).</p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed 37 trials (n = 16,117) of exercise interventions to prevent falls in community-dwelling older adults. The trials generally included multiple exercise components, and the exercise interventions were primarily conducted in a supervised group setting. The mean age of participants ranged from 68 years<sup>12</sup> to 88 years.<sup>13</sup> Twenty trials solely recruited participants at increased risk, while 15 trials included populations with anywhere from 6% to 59% of participants at increased risk for falls; 2 trials did not report the percentage of participants at increased risk. Most trials (22/37) included a history of falls as either the sole criterion or as 1 of several risk factors defining increased risk. Across the 35 trials that reported it, 58% of participants were at increased risk for falls.<sup>4,11</sup></p>\r\n<p>Most trials studying exercise interventions used multiple exercise components, including gait, balance, and functional training; strength and resistance; flexibility; tai chi/3-dimensional training; general physical activity; and endurance. Nearly all exercise interventions included gait, balance, and functional training (30/37 trials), and about two-thirds of the trials (25/37) included a strength and resistance training component.<sup>4,11</sup></p>\r\n<p>A pooled analysis of 29 trials (n = 14,475) demonstrated that exercise interventions were associated with a significant reduction in the rate of incident falls at the longest follow-up (6-24 months) (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.85 [95% CI, 0.75-0.96]). Pooled analyses also showed that exercise interventions reduced the number of persons experiencing 1 or more falls at the longest follow-up (6-24 months) (25 trials; n = 13,384; relative risk, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.87-0.98]) and risk of injurious falls at 6 to 60 months of follow-up (12 trials; n = 3984; IRR, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.74-0.95]). Pooled analyses found no significant reductions in fall-related fractures or all-cause mortality.<sup>4,11</sup></p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed 28 trials (n = 27,784) of multifactorial interventions to prevent falls in community-dwelling older adults. These trials included a heterogeneous group of complex assessment and intervention components. Mean age ranged from 72 years14 to 85 years.<sup>15</sup> Twenty-one trials solely recruited patients at increased risk for falls according to various definitions. Nearly half of the trials (13/28) defined increased risk as having a history of falling as the sole criterion. Among the 7 remaining trials that recruited patients unselected for risk, 5 reported that 19% to 44% of those recruited were at increased risk for falls, and 2 did not report the percent of participants at increased risk. Across the 26 trials that reported it, 65% of participants were at increased risk.<sup>4,11</sup></p>\r\n<p>All trials administered an initial assessment of modifiable fall risk factors to customize the intervention for each participant. All trials assessed fall risk factors; the most commonly assessed components were functional assessments (eg, timed Up and Go test<sup>16</sup>), environmental assessments, medication review, and vision assessments. All trials delivered individualized fall prevention advice and recommendations based on the multifactorial risk assessment. The most commonly recommended intervention components were individual or group exercise interventions, medication review, referral to vision and/or hearing specialists, and recommendations or referrals for environmental modifications. However, not all recommendations were consistently implemented; most commonly, adherence to recommendations was in the 60% to 70% range for any individual recommendation or referral. Additionally, several trials provided intervention components to all participants regardless of the results of the risk assessment. For example, 9 of 28 trials gave 100% of the intervention group participants an exercise intervention, while 17 trials referred patients as needed to an exercise intervention.<sup>4,11</sup></p>\r\n<p>A pooled analysis of 20 trials (n = 22,115) demonstrated that multifactorial interventions were associated with a significant reduction in the rate of incident falls at the longest follow-up (6-28 months) (IRR, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.74-0.95]). However, pooled analyses found no significant reductions in the number of persons experiencing a fall, injurious falls, fall-related fractures, or all-cause mortality.<sup>4,11</sup></p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found evidence on other interventions, including environment assessment (6 trials), exercise in combination with education intervention (4 trials), medication review (4 trials), exercise in combination with environmental assessment (3 trials), psychological intervention (3 trials), and a group education intervention (1 trial).<sup>4,11</sup> Studies of these other interventions were too few, too small, and had other limitations (eg, recommendations from an assessment were not always implemented) to allow the USPSTF to draw any definitive conclusions.</p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF also reviewed the evidence on the harms of interventions to prevent falls. Half of the exercise trials reported harms, with generally minor musculoskeletal adverse effects being most common; serious harms were generally rare. Adverse events directly related to the exercise intervention were largely musculoskeletal discomfort and pain symptoms.<sup>3</sup> One trial reported a fall-related wrist fracture,<sup>17</sup> and another reported a hip fracture attributed to an exercise session.<sup>18</sup></p>\r\n<p>For trials studying multifactorial interventions, harms were sparsely reported. When reported, they were rare, minor, and associated with the exercise components of the multifactorial interventions. In total, 5 trials (n = 4199) reported harms associated with multifactorial interventions, such as falls without injuries, back pain, and musculoskeletal pain.<sup>4,11</sup></p>\r\n<p>Trials of other interventions reported harms sparsely or not at all, or in the intervention group but not in the control group.<sup>4,11</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from December 5, 2023, to January 8, 2024. Some comments noted the need for risk assessment tools that have greater accuracy to identify persons at risk for falls. The USPSTF agrees and calls for research to develop and validate primary care&ndash;feasible risk assessment tools that accurately predict risk for falls in older adults in the Research Needs and Gaps table of this recommendation (<a href=\"#tab2\">Table 2</a>). Some comments requested greater specificity about the types of exercise interventions that are recommended. In response, the USPSTF notes that the studies of exercise interventions it reviewed varied in several ways, such as providing individual vs group sessions and in the exercise components of the interventions. As noted in the recommendation statement, while it is difficult to identify specific components of exercise that are particularly effective, nearly all exercise interventions included gait, balance, and functional training, and most included a strength and resistance training component. Last, in response to public comment, the USPSTF clarified that its research gap on the effectiveness and harms of interventions in different functional groups includes groups at high risk of falls, such as persons 85 years or older.</p>\r\n<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\n<p>See <a href=\"#tab2\">Table 2</a>&nbsp;for research needs and gaps related to interventions for fall prevention in community-dwelling older adults.</p><h2>Recommendations of Others</h2><p>The CDC recommends STEADI, a coordinated approach for fall prevention in adults 65 years or older that consists of 3 core elements: screen to identify fall risk, assess modifiable risk factors, and intervene using effective clinical and community strategies to reduce the identified risk.<sup>19</sup> The US Department of Health and Human Services recommends that older adults engage in multicomponent physical activity that includes balance training, as well as aerobic and muscle-strengthening activities, as part of the 150 to 300 minutes per week of moderate-intensity, or 75 to 150 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity recommended for all adults.<sup>5</sup> The American Academy of Family Physicians supports the USPSTF 2018 recommendation on fall prevention in community-dwelling older adults.<sup>20</sup></p><h2>Table 2.

Older adults are defined as those 65 years or older.</p>\r\n<h3>Condition Definitions</h3>\r\n<p>Anxiety disorders are characterized by disproportionate and constant fear over everyday events accompanied by behavioral and somatic complaints (eg, restlessness, fatigue, problems concentrating, irritability, or sleep problems).<sup>9</sup> The <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (Fifth Edition) recognizes the following types of anxiety disorders: generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, agoraphobia, specific phobias, separation anxiety disorder, selective mutism, substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder, anxiety disorder due to another medical condition, and anxiety not otherwise specified.<sup>9</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>\r\n<p>Risk factors for anxiety disorders include sociodemographic factors, psychosocial factors, and physical and mental health factors such as marital status (widowed or divorced), stressful life events, smoking and alcohol use, other mental health conditions, or a parental history of mental disorders.<sup>1,10</sup> Demographic factors such as low socioeconomic status and female sex are associated with higher rates of anxiety disorders.<sup>1</sup> Black persons and individuals of non-Hispanic ethnicity are at increased risk of anxiety disorders due to social, rather than biological, factors.1Anxiety and depressive disorders often overlap. One cohort study found that 67% of individuals with a depressive disorder also had a current anxiety disorder, and 75% had a lifetime comorbid anxiety disorder.<sup>1,11</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>Brief tools have been developed that screen for anxiety disorders and are available for use in primary care. Selected screening tools widely used in the US include versions of the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) scale, Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) anxiety subscale, Geriatric Anxiety Scale (GAS), and the Geriatric Anxiety Inventory (GAI).<sup>1</sup> Some instruments that are used for screening for anxiety disorders were initially developed for purposes other than screening, such as supporting diagnosis, assessing severity, or evaluating response to treatment. Anxiety screening tools alone are insufficient to diagnose anxiety disorders. If a screening test result is positive for an anxiety disorder, a confirmatory diagnostic assessment is needed.</p>\r\n<h3>Screening Intervals</h3>\r\n<p>There is little evidence regarding optimal timing for screening, or screening interval, for both the perinatal and general adult populations; more evidence on both timing and screening interval is needed for all adult populations. A pragmatic approach in the absence of evidence might include screening all adults who have not been screened previously and using clinical judgment in considering risk factors, comorbid conditions, and life events to determine if additional screening of high-risk patients is warranted. Ongoing assessment of risks that may develop during pregnancy and the postpartum period is also a reasonable approach.</p>\r\n<h3>Treatment or Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>Treatment for anxiety disorders in adults can include psychotherapy (eg, cognitive behavioral, interpersonal, family, and acceptance and commitment therapy) and pharmacotherapy (eg, antidepressants, antihistamines, &beta;-blockers, anticonvulsant medications, and benzodiazepines). Anxiety treatment may also include relaxation and desensitization therapies. Transdiagnostic treatment approaches have also been developed for use with patients who have anxiety disorders, depression, or both conditions because of the overlap between depressive and anxiety disorders.<sup>1</sup> Clinicians are encouraged to consider the unique balance of benefits and harms in the perinatal period when deciding the best treatment for an anxiety disorder for a pregnant or breastfeeding person.</p>\r\n<h3>Implementation</h3>\r\n<p>Adequate systems and clinical staff are needed to ensure that patients are screened with valid and reliable screening tools. For patients to benefit from screening, positive screening results should be confirmed by diagnostic assessment and patients should be provided, or referred to, evidence-based care, which should be accessible to all populations.</p>\r\n<p>Potential barriers to screening include clinician knowledge and comfort level with screening, inadequate systems to support screening or to manage positive screening results, and impact on care flow, given the time constraints faced by primary care clinicians. Clinicians should be cognizant to stigma issues associated with mental health diagnoses and should aim to develop trusting relationships with patients, free of implicit bias, by being sensitive to cultural issues.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<p>Clinicians should also be cognizant of the barriers that could keep individuals with anxiety disorders, particularly those identified through screening, from receiving adequate treatment. Less than half of individuals who experience a mental illness will receive mental health care.<sup>12</sup> Systemic barriers, such as lack of connection between mental health and primary care, patient hesitation to initiate treatment, and nonadherence to medication and therapy, also exist.<sup>13,14</sup> Racism and structural policies have contributed to wealth inequities in the US,<sup>15</sup> which also affects mental health in underserved communities. For example, wealth inequities may result in barriers to receiving mental health services, such as treatment costs and lack of insurance, which tend to have a greater impact on Black persons and other racial and ethnic groups than on White persons.<sup>16</sup> The misdiagnosis of mental health conditions occurs more in Black and Hispanic/Latino patients compared with White patients.<sup>17-19</sup> Black and Hispanic/Latino patients are also less likely to receive mental health services than Asian American or White patients.<sup>20,21</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>\r\n<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>\r\n<p>Anxiety disorders often have onset during childhood and adolescence (median age, 11 years). The prevalence of anxiety disorders decreases in the middle and older adult years and is lowest among adults aged 65 to 79 years.<sup>1</sup> Anxiety disorders have long-term effects that include impaired quality of life and functioning and sizeable economic costs.</p>\r\n<h4>Potential Harms</h4>\r\n<p>Potential harms of screening include false-positive screening results that lead to unnecessary referrals, the potential for overdiagnosis and unnecessary treatment, labeling, and stigma. Furthermore, these harms are likely to occur to varying degrees across different populations and in different practice settings. For example, some screening instruments not specifically designed for older adults may more often misidentify older adults as having anxiety disorders than they do in younger adult populations, and diagnosing an anxiety disorder may be more stigmatizing for some groups (based on culture or occupation) than for other groups. Additionally, whereas psychological interventions are likely to have minimal harms,<sup>1</sup> pharmacologic interventions may result in adverse events, even if they have proven benefits. Evidence on harms of screening and treatment in older adults is limited, and additional research is needed to identify effective screening tools and treatments for older adults.</p>\r\n<h4>Current Practice</h4>\r\n<p>There is a lack of evidence on screening rates for anxiety disorders.<sup>1</sup> Underdetection appears to be common. This may be because patients with anxiety disorders present with other concerns, such as sleep disturbances or somatic issues.<sup>1</sup> One study found that only 13.3% of primary care patients with generalized anxiety disorder presented with anxiety as the chief concern; more common concerns in these patients were somatic issues (47.8%), pain (34.7%), and sleep disturbance (32.5%).<sup>22</sup> Delays in treatment initiation also commonly occur. Only 11% of US adults with an anxiety disorder started treatment within the first year of onset; the median time to treatment initiation was 23 years.<sup>3,4</sup> A US study of 965 primary care patients found that only 41% of patients with an anxiety disorder were receiving treatment for their disorder.<sup>1,23</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Additional Tools and Resources</h3>\r\n<p>The Community Preventive Services Task Force recommends mental health benefits legislation to increase appropriate utilization of mental health services for persons with mental health conditions (<a href=\"https://www.thecommunityguide.org/findings/mental-health-and-mental-illness-mental-health-benefits-legislation.html\">https://www.thecommunityguide.org/findings/mental-health-and-mental-illness-mental-health-benefits-legislation.html</a>).</p>\r\n<p>The National Institute of Mental Health has information on anxiety disorders (<a href=\"https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/anxiety-disorders\">https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/anxiety-disorders</a>).</p>\r\n<p>Perinatal Psychiatry Access Programs are population-based programs that aim to increase access to perinatal mental health care (<a href=\"https://www.umassmed.edu/lifeline4moms/Access-Programs/\">https://www.umassmed.edu/lifeline4moms/Access-Programs/</a>). These programs build the capacity of medical professionals to address perinatal mental health and substance use disorders.</p>\r\n<h3>Other Related USPSTF Recommendations</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF has recommendations on mental health topics pertaining to adults, including screening for depression and suicide risk,<sup>24</sup> preventive counseling interventions for perinatal depression,<sup>25</sup> screening for unhealthy drug use,<sup>26</sup> and screening and behavioral counseling interventions for alcohol use.<sup>27</sup></p>","other":"<h2>Supporting Evidence</h2><h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF commissioned a systematic review<sup>1,28</sup> to evaluate the benefits and harms of screening for anxiety disorders in asymptomatic adults. The USPSTF has not previously made a recommendation on this topic. Conditions reviewed included generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and anxiety not otherwise specified.</p>\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>Ten studies (n = 6463) evaluated the accuracy of screening for anxiety disorders with the GAD, GAS, EPDS anxiety subscale, or Patient Health Questionnaire&ndash;Panic Disorder instruments.<sup>1,28</sup> Two studies were conducted in older adults (65 years or older), 3 studies in pregnant patients, and the remaining studies in adults from primary care. In the 10 studies, the mean age ranged from 29 to 75 years and women were represented in higher proportions (57%-100%) than men.<sup>1,28</sup> Race and/or ethnicity was reported in 6 studies; 3 studies were conducted in primarily White participants (79% to 91%), 1 study in South Korean participants (100%), and 1 study in Hispanic/Latino participants (76%).<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<p>The most commonly studied instruments were the GAD-2 and GAD-7. There was limited evidence for other instruments and other anxiety disorders. Only the GAD-2 and GAD-7 were reported by more than 1 study.</p>\r\n<p>The GAD-2 and GAD-7 demonstrated adequate sensitivity and specificity to detect generalized anxiety disorder.<sup>1,28</sup> Three studies among general adult populations reported the test accuracy of the GAD-2 to detect generalized anxiety disorder.<sup>1,28</sup> At a cutoff of 2 or greater, the pooled sensitivity of the GAD-2 to detect generalized anxiety disorder was 0.94 (95% CI, 0.90-0.98; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 0%) and the pooled specificity was 0.68 (95% CI, 0.64-0.72; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 94.5%). At a cutoff of 3 or greater, the pooled sensitivity was 0.81 (95% CI, 0.73-0.89; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 28.8%) and the pooled specificity was 0.86 (95% CI, 0.83-0.90; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 84.5%).<sup>12,28</sup></p>\r\n<p>Three studies reported test accuracy for the GAD-7 at a cutoff of 8 or greater, 9 or greater, and 10 or greater.<sup>1,28</sup> At a cutoff of 10 or greater, the pooled sensitivity to detect generalized anxiety disorder was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.65-0.94; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 77.3%) and the pooled specificity was 0.89 (95% CI, 0.83-0.94; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 94.8%). Sensitivity among the 3 studies ranged from 0.67 to 0.89 and specificity ranged from 0.82 to 0.95. At lower cutoffs (&ge;8; &ge;9), sensitivity increased and specificity decreased. In general, the GAD-7 performed as well or better than the GAD-2.<sup>1,28</sup></p>\r\n<p>In a study among pregnant persons (n = 9750), the sensitivity of the GAD-2 to identify generalized anxiety disorder, using a cutoff of 1 or greater, was 1.0 (95% CI, 0.99-1.0) and the specificity was 0.60 (95% CI, 0.60-0.61). At a cutoff of 3 or greater, the sensitivity to detect generalized anxiety disorder was 0.69 (95% CI, 0.64-0.73) and the specificity was 0.91 (95% CI, 0.90-0.91).<sup>1,28</sup> The screening instrument used in this large study of pregnant persons had performance characteristics similar to those of the screening instrument used in the general population of adults, predominantly younger than 65 years. As a result, the USPSTF extrapolated the evidence on accuracy of the GAD-2 in younger adults to pregnant and postpartum persons.</p>\r\n<p>In contrast, the evidence on older adults is lacking. Few of the studies provided accuracy data for screening tools in older adults. A small study of older adults (n = 110) evaluated the GAS to detect any anxiety disorder using cutoffs ranging from greater than 9 to greater than 16. A cutoff of greater than 9 demonstrated the optimal balance of sensitivity (0.60 [95% CI, 0.31-0.83]) and specificity (0.75 [(95% CI, 0.66-0.82]).<sup>1,28</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found 2 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) (n = 918) that directly evaluated the benefits of screening for anxiety disorders in adult populations in primary care settings. Neither trial found differences between the randomized groups in anxiety or depressive symptoms or general psychological symptom severity at 13 to 22 weeks of follow-up.<sup>1,28</sup></p>\r\n<p>Twenty-four RCTs (n = 5307) and 8 existing systematic reviews (&asymp;144 RCTs; n &asymp; 11,030) assessed the benefits of treatment for anxiety disorders with psychological interventions. Fourteen of the trials were conducted in mixed populations of persons with anxiety disorders or depression, and 10 trials were conducted in persons with anxiety disorders or symptoms.<sup>1,28</sup></p>\r\n<p>These psychological treatment trials included adults of all ages and perinatal populations; 16 studies included general adult populations, 4 studies were limited to older adults, and 1 study was limited to perinatal patients.<sup>1,28</sup> The mean age was 46.1 years, and 74% of participants were women. Seven trials were conducted in the US and 14 trials were conducted outside of the US.<sup>1,28</sup> Among the 7 trials conducted in the US, 1.5% of participants were Asian American or Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, 15.3% were Black, 16.3% were Hispanic/Latino, less than 1% were Native American/Alaska Native, and 68.5% were White. In the remaining studies that reported race and ethnicity, White adults comprised from 56.6% to 81.8% of participants.<sup>1,28</sup></p>\r\n<p>Studies of psychological interventions showed a small but statistically significant reduction in anxiety symptom severity in primary care patients with anxiety disorders (standardized mean difference [SMD], &minus;0.41 [95% CI, &minus;0.58 to &minus;0.23]; 10 RCTs [n = 2075]; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 40.2%) but not among mixed populations of patients with anxiety disorders or depression (SMD, &minus;0.18 [95% CI, &minus;0.39 to 0.03]; 12 RCTs [n = 1868]; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 66.7%). In the existing systematic reviews (which were not limited to primary care patients), psychological treatment was associated with reduced anxiety symptoms. Standardized mean differences at posttreatment among broad adult populations were &minus;0.80 and larger, (eg, SMD among persons with generalized anxiety disorder, &minus;0.80 [95% CI, &minus;0.93 to &minus;0.67]; 31 RCTs; N and <em>I<sup>2</sup></em>&nbsp;not reported). Psychological treatment (cognitive behavioral therapy) in general adult populations was also associated with improved depressive symptom severity and quality of life. Findings for perinatal persons were similar (eg, SMD, &minus;0.63 [95% CI, &minus;0.83 to &minus;0.43]; 33 RCTs [n = 3063]).<sup>1,28</sup></p>\r\n<p>There was limited evidence to suggest a benefit of psychological treatment in older adults. In older adults (among whom evidence on the accuracy of screening tests is lacking), only 7 RCTs were found (n = 215), with a pooled SMD of &minus;0.66 (95% CI, &minus;0.94 to &minus;0.38).</p>\r\n<p>There were only 2 RCTs of pharmacotherapy in primary care patients, addressing venlafaxine and escitalopram, and both showed a benefit. Broad existing systematic reviews (ie, not limited to primary care patients) reported improved anxiety and other outcomes for persons taking antidepressants compared with persons taking placebo. For example, among patients with generalized anxiety disorder, the SMD for change in anxiety symptom severity with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors was &minus;0.66 (95% CI, &minus;0.90 to &minus;0.43; 23 studies [n = 2142]; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> not reported). For antidepressants, benefits were seen for a variety of anxiety outcomes; for example, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, and panic disorder. Limited evidence suggested that antidepressants may improve anxiety symptoms in older adults, but evidence in perinatal patients was lacking. Improvements with pharmacotherapy were also seen for depressive symptoms and social functioning outcomes.<sup>1,28</sup></p>\r\n<p>Overall, there was limited direct evidence on the benefits of anxiety disorder screening programs. However, there was adequate indirect evidence of the benefit of screening for anxiety disorders in adults younger than 65 years and perinatal persons, as screening tools demonstrated accuracy in detecting generalized anxiety disorder and evidence supported treatment for adults with generalized anxiety disorder.</p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Screening and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The 2 trials (n = 918) that directly evaluated screening for anxiety disorders did not report harms, and there was no pattern of effects indicating harms.<sup>1,28</sup> None of the RCTs or existing systematic reviews of psychological treatment reported on adverse events. Three RCTs (n = 669), 8 existing systematic reviews (&asymp;112 RCTs [n &asymp; 29,674]), and 2 case-control studies (n = 262,3780) addressed the harms of pharmacologic treatment. Most evidence occurred in general adult populations. Evidence demonstrated an increase in nonserious harms (defined as any adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse events). Serious adverse events were rare and data were insufficient to determine whether pharmacotherapy increased the risk of serious harm.<sup>1,28</sup> Case-control studies found an association between benzodiazepine use and suicide death; however, the inability to fully match cases and controls on severity of mental health symptoms and other health behaviors is a limitation of these studies.<sup>1,28</sup> There were very limited observational data on specific serious harms in older adults and pregnant persons.<sup>1,28</sup> Although no eligible evidence on the risk of addiction or misuse of benzodiazepines was identified, the US Food and Drug Administration has issued a warning for these potential harms, even when taken at recommended dosages.<sup>1,28</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from September 20, 2022, to October 17, 2022. In response to comments, the USPSTF added text throughout the recommendation statement about the lack of evidence in older adults and highlighted it as an evidence gap in the Research Needs and Gaps section. The USPSTF added text in the Practice Considerations section to address barriers to screening, such as lack of clinician training, time constraints, and lack of systems to ensure adequate follow-up. The USPSTF revised the text to reflect that the recommendation statement addresses &ldquo;anxiety disorders.&rdquo; The USPSTF added language about screening harms to the Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement section. The USPSTF incorporated language regarding screening intervals into the Practice Considerations section and highlighted it as an evidence gap. The USPSTF addressed the use of pharmacotherapy in pregnant and postpartum persons in the Practice Considerations section. The USPSTF arrived at its recommendation based on an indirect pathway; it incorporated clarifying language throughout the recommendation statement to reflect this pathway. Comments asked about the inclusion of persons with comorbid medical and mental health conditions. Assessing patients with comorbid health conditions would be considered disease management and out of scope for the USPSTF. Therefore, the evidence review for the USPSTF excluded studies that only included individuals with comorbid conditions.</p><h2>Research Needs and Gaps</h2><p>There are several critical evidence gaps.

Untreated syphilis infection during pregnancy can be passed to the fetus, causing congenital syphilis. Congenital syphilis is associated with premature birth, low birth weight, stillbirth, neonatal death, and significant abnormalities in the infant such as deformed bones, anemia, enlarged liver and spleen, jaundice, brain and nerve problems (eg, permanent vision or hearing loss), and meningitis.<sup>1</sup> In 2023, there were 3882 cases of congenital syphilis in the US, including 279 congenital syphilis&ndash;related stillbirths and neonatal/infant deaths,<sup>2</sup> the highest number reported in more than 30 years.</p>\r\n<p>Rates of new syphilis cases have continued to rise over the past 3 decades, especially in women. Although men account for the majority of syphilis cases, the change in incidence among women was 2 to 4 times higher than that among men between 2017 and 2021.<sup>3</sup> Consequently, cases of congenital syphilis have also increased. Congenital syphilis increased more than 10-fold over a recent decade, from 334 cases in 2012 to 3882 cases in 2023.<sup>2,4</sup> It is estimated that almost 90% of new congenital syphilis cases could have been prevented with timely testing and treatment.<sup>4</sup></p>\r\n<p>Certain racial and ethnic groups in the US are disproportionately affected by syphilis. Based on 2023 sexually transmitted infection surveillance data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), congenital syphilis rates were 9.3 cases per 100,000 live births in Asian women, 222.0 cases per 100,000 live births in Black women, 125.0 cases per 100,000 live births in Hispanic or Latina women, 680.8 cases per 100,000 live births in Native American/Alaska Native women, 295.6 live births per 100,000 live births in Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander women, 82.2 cases per 100,000 live births in multiracial women, and 57.3 cases per 100 000 live births in White women.<sup>5</sup> Reviews of medical, public health, and social science literature have reported that social context and disparities in social factors such as poverty, neighborhood opportunities, incarceration rates, segregation, and ratio of men to women may influence sexual behavior and sexual networks, likely contributing to the observed racial disparities in sexually transmitted infection rates.<sup>6-8</sup></p><h2>USPSTF Assessment of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h2><p>In 2018, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) reviewed the evidence for screening for syphilis infection in asymptomatic pregnant women and issued an A recommendation.<sup>9</sup> The USPSTF has decided to use a reaffirmation deliberation process to update this recommendation. The USPSTF uses the reaffirmation process for well-established, evidence-based standards of practice in current primary care practice for which only a very high level of evidence would justify a change in the grade of the recommendation.<sup>10</sup> In its deliberation of the evidence, the USPSTF considers whether the new evidence is of sufficient strength and quality to change its previous conclusions about the evidence.</p>\r\n<p>Using a reaffirmation process, the USPSTF concludes with high certainty that screening for syphilis infection in pregnancy has a <strong>substantial net benefit</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>See <a href=\"#tab1\">Table 1</a> for more information on the USPSTF recommendation rationale and assessment.

Treponemal tests, such as the <em>T pallidum</em> particle agglutination (TP-PA) test, detect an antibody response to antigens specific to <em>T pallidum</em>.<sup>11</sup> Nontreponemal tests, such as the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory or rapid plasma reagin test, detect antibodies that may reflect tissue damage from <em>T pallidum</em> infection or tissue damage from other conditions that can cause the release of lipoidal antigens. Because of high false-positive rates associated with nontreponemal tests alone, especially in pregnancy, a 2-step process is used to improve diagnostic accuracy. A <em>traditional screening algorithm</em> is a 2-step process that begins with a nontreponemal test (eg, Venereal Disease Research Laboratory or rapid plasma reagin) followed by a confirmatory treponemal test (eg, TP-PA) for persons with positive nontreponemal test results. A <em>reverse sequence algorithm</em> uses an automated treponemal test (eg, enzyme-linked or chemiluminescence immunoassay) for the initial screening, followed by a nontreponemal test for reactive samples. Discordant results in the reverse sequence are resolved with a second confirmatory treponemal test (TP-PA preferred). The automated processes used in reverse sequence may be appropriate for high-volume laboratories.<sup>1,11</sup><em>&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n<p><em>Point-of-care tests</em> for antibodies to <em>T pallidum</em> are available that can be performed in a clinical setting or at home using fingerstick blood samples that do not require laboratory processing.<sup>12</sup> It is unclear how results from these tests alone, without additional confirmatory testing, should guide treatment decisions.</p>\r\n<h3>Screening Timing and Intervals</h3>\r\n<p>All pregnant women should be tested for syphilis when they first present to care. Screening for syphilis should occur as early in pregnancy as possible. If early testing is not done, testing should occur at the first opportunity, which could be as late as at admission for delivery. A recent analysis of national data from 2022 found that 5% of congenital syphilis cases (197/3761 cases) occurred in late pregnancy after having had a negative syphilis screening result earlier in pregnancy.<sup>4</sup> Similar to the disparities seen in the burden of syphilis, 40.6% of these cases occurred in Black women, 28.4% occurred in Hispanic or Latina women, and 19.8% occurred in White women.<sup>4</sup> Some retrospective studies estimate that 25% to 50% of congenital syphilis cases could be prevented by repeat screening in the third trimester of pregnancy.<sup>13-15</sup> The CDC,16 Women&rsquo;s Preventive Services Initiative (WPSI),<sup>17</sup> American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP),<sup>18</sup> and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)<sup>19</sup> recommend repeat screening in the early third trimester (approximately 28 weeks of gestation) and again at delivery; however, these organizations differ in whether they recommend repeat screening for all pregnant women<sup>19</sup> or just for those at high risk for syphilis infection. Women at high risk for syphilis infection include those who live in high-prevalence areas; have a history of HIV, incarceration, or multiple sexual partners; engage in sex in combination with drug use or commercial sex work; or are experiencing homelessness.<sup>16,18</sup> Clinicians should be aware of the prevalence of syphilis infection in the communities they serve and state mandates for syphilis screening. Most states mandate screening for syphilis in all pregnant women at the first prenatal visit, and some mandate repeat screening early in the third trimester and at delivery.<sup>20</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The CDC recommends parenteral penicillin G as the only treatment with documented efficacy during pregnancy. Treatment protocols are specific to the stage of syphilis infection, with later-stage infection requiring longer duration of treatment. When syphilis is diagnosed during the second half of pregnancy, management should include a sonographic fetal evaluation for signs of congenital syphilis. Pregnant women with a penicillin allergy should be desensitized and then treated with penicillin. Approximately 10% of patients report a penicillin allergy, although the number of patients who are truly allergic may be much smaller.<sup>16,21,22</sup> Clinicians are encouraged to refer to the CDC&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sexually Transmitted Infection Treatment Guidelines&rdquo; for the most up-to-date treatment guidance.<sup>16</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Additional Tools and Resources</h3>\r\n<p>A list of state prenatal syphilis screening laws and regulations (<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/syphilis/hcp/prenatal-screening-laws/index.html\">https://www.cdc.gov/syphilis/hcp/prenatal-screening-laws/index.html</a>) and county-level data on syphilis infection rates (<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/sti-statistics/county-level-syphilis-data/\">https://www.cdc.gov/sti-statistics/county-level-syphilis-data/</a>) are available from the CDC. The CDC also provides multilingual materials for patients on syphilis prenatal screening (<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/sti/php/communication-resources/syphilis-prenatal-screening-protect-your-baby.html\">https://www.cdc.gov/sti/php/communication-resources/syphilis-prenatal-screening-protect-your-baby.html</a>).</p>\r\n<p>Other Related USPSTF Recommendations</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF has issued recommendations on screening for syphilis in adults and adolescents who are not pregnant,<sup>23</sup> as well as screening for other sexually transmitted infections, including chlamydia and gonorrhea,<sup>24</sup> hepatitis B virus,<sup>25,26</sup> genital herpes,<sup>27</sup> and HIV.<sup>28</sup> The USPSTF has also issued a recommendation on counseling to prevent sexually transmitted infections.<sup>29</sup> Current versions of these and other related USPSTF recommendations are available at <a href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/\">https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/</a>.</p><h2>Reaffirmation of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h2><p>This recommendation is a reaffirmation of the USPSTF 2018 reaffirmation recommendation statement. In 2018, the USPSTF reviewed the evidence for screening for syphilis infection during pregnancy and found that the benefits of screening substantially outweighed the harms.<sup>9</sup> The USPSTF found no new substantial evidence that could change its recommendation and, therefore, reaffirms its recommendation to screen for syphilis infection during pregnancy.</p>","other":"<h2>Supporting Evidence</h2><h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n<p>To reaffirm its recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a reaffirmation evidence update. The aim of the evidence update that supports the reaffirmation process is to identify &ldquo;new and substantial evidence sufficient enough to justify a change in the grade of the recommendation.&rdquo;<sup>10</sup> The reaffirmation update focused on key questions on the benefits and harms of screening for syphilis infection in adolescents and adults who are pregnant.</p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no new evidence that was inconsistent with the previously established benefits of screening for syphilis infection during pregnancy. No new studies were identified that evaluated the effectiveness of screening to decrease congenital syphilis rates or improve maternal health outcomes.<sup>1,30</sup> Evidence from previous reviews<sup>31</sup> demonstrates fewer adverse pregnancy outcomes among pregnant women screened and treated for syphilis infection compared with those not treated. Treatment appears to be more beneficial when provided earlier rather than later in pregnancy.<sup>31</sup> A 2014 systematic review of 54 observational studies found that the incidence of congenital syphilis, preterm birth, low birth weight, stillbirth, and neonatal death was dramatically reduced in pregnant women treated for syphilis during pregnancy compared with those who had untreated syphilis.<sup>32</sup> The reduction in stillbirth and fetal loss was much smaller when treatment did not occur until the third trimester. The USPSTF previously reviewed evidence on the effects of implementing a free syphilis screening and treatment program for all pregnant women living in Shenzhen, China, from 2002 to 2012 (n = 2,441,237).<sup>33</sup> During follow-up, screening uptake increased from 89.8% to 97.2%, and the congenital syphilis case rate decreased from 109.3 to 9.4 cases per 100,000 live births. During the same time, the incidence of adverse pregnancy outcomes decreased from 42.7% to 19.2%, and the incidence of stillbirth or fetal loss decreased from 19.0% to 3.3%.</p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Screening and Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>Potential harms of screening for and treatment of syphilis infection include false-positive or discordant results from screening that require clinical evaluation, unnecessary anxiety to the patient, and harms of antibiotic medication use for treatment. The current reaffirmation review identified 5 studies (51,118 participants) that evaluated the harms of screening and 2 studies (130 participants) that evaluated the harms of treatment.<sup>1,30</sup> The 5 studies<sup>34-38</sup> that evaluated the harms of screening were all conducted in the US (1 study was conducted in the US and Argentina<sup>38</sup>) and reported on false-positive rates of a single screening test. All 5 of these studies included participants from a variety of racial and ethnic backgrounds; however, only 2 studies<sup>34,38</sup> reported this information for their full study cohort. Black participants ranged from 18% to 67%, White participants ranged from 5% to 20%, and &ldquo;Other&rdquo; participants ranged from 0.2% to 13%. One of the studies additionally reported including 3% Asian participants and 75% Hispanic participants.<sup>34</sup> Two studies, conducted in Canada and Brazil, reported on the harms of treatment, which included rates of Jarisch-Herxhemier reactions (an acute, febrile reaction that often includes body aches, tachycardia, hypotension, and rash and can occur within the first 24 hours of antibiotic treatment of a spirochete infection<sup>16,39</sup>) and immediate hypersensitivity reactions to penicillin.<sup>40,41</sup></p>\r\n<p>For treatment harms, 1 small study (n = 39) reported that 5.1% of patients receiving penicillin therapy experienced Jarisch-Herxheimer reactions.<sup>40</sup> A second small study (n = 91) evaluated an algorithm to help guide penicillin desensitization among pregnant patients with syphilis who had a clinical history of immediate hypersensitivity reaction to penicillin.<sup>41</sup> Among patients considered at&nbsp; high risk for an immediate hypersensitivity reaction, 27.3% experienced it after oral desensitization and 2.5% experienced it after intravenous desensitization; 2.5% of patients considered at low risk for an immediate hypersensitivity reaction experienced it after penicillin provocation. Overall, the USPSTF found this evidence consistent with the previously known harms of syphilis screening and treatment during pregnancy.</p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comments</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from November 19 to December 23, 2024. A few comments were received asking that the USPSTF align with recommendations from other organizations and recommend repeat screening later in pregnancy. The USPSTF acknowledges that the recent rise of congenital syphilis cases is concerning and is dedicated to finding evidence-based strategies to prevent congenital syphilis. Due to limited available evidence, the USPSTF was not able to assess the effectiveness of screening more than once during pregnancy and is not making a recommendation for or against repeat screening. The USPSTF is calling for more research on the effectiveness of repeat screening during pregnancy and highlights this in the Research Needs and Gaps section. The USPSTF also describes other organizations&rsquo; approaches to repeat screening in the Practice Considerations section and Recommendations of Others section. Some comments also sought clarity on the specific time point when screening should be performed. Although a specific time point for screening could not be identified through the evidence, the USPSTF found that generally, reductions in congenital syphilis rates were greater when treatment was completed earlier in pregnancy rather than later. However, benefits were still seen when screening and treatment occurred later in pregnancy. Thus, the USPSTF recommends that screening occur as early in pregnancy as possible, even when this may be late in pregnancy or at delivery. This has been clarified in the recommendation. Last, a few comments sought clarification on who should be screened for syphilis during pregnancy. The USPSTF recommends universal syphilis screening in <em>all</em> adolescents and adults who are pregnant, whether or not risk factors for syphilis are present. Clarifying language has been added to the Practice Considerations section.</p><h2>Research Needs and Gaps</h2><p>See <a href=\"#tab2\">Table 2</a> for research needs and gaps related to screening for syphilis infection during pregnancy.</p><h2>Recommendations of Others</h2><p>This recommendation statement is consistent with those of other professional and public health organizations. The CDC,<sup>16</sup> WSPI,<sup>17</sup> AAP,<sup>18</sup> and ACOG<sup>19</sup> recommend initial screening for syphilis infection in all pregnant women at their first prenatal visit, even if previously tested. ACOG19 recommends universal rescreening during the third trimester and at birth and the CDC,<sup>16</sup> WPSI,<sup>17</sup> and AAP<sup>18</sup> recommend rescreening at 28 weeks of gestation and again at delivery in women at high risk for acquiring syphilis. AAP<sup>18</sup> and ACOG<sup>19</sup> also recommend repeat screening after exposure to an infected partner. The American Academy of Family Physicians supports the 2018 USPSTF recommendation on screening for syphilis infection in pregnant women.<sup>42</sup></p><h2>Table 2.

The recommendation on screening in older and vulnerable adults applies to persons without recognized signs and symptoms of abuse or neglect.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<h3>Definitions</h3>\r\n<p>IPV refers to physical violence, sexual violence, psychological aggression (including coercive tactics, such as limiting access to financial resources), or stalking by a current or former spouse or dating partner.<sup>1,9</sup></p>\r\n<p>Abuse of older adults refers to acts whereby a trusted person (eg, a caregiver) causes or creates risk of harm to an older adult.<sup>1,10</sup> For this definition, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) considers adults 60 years or older.<sup>1,10</sup> The term <em>caregiver</em> broadly refers to relationships with a provision of assistance with daily activities and an expectation of trust. <em>Abuse of vulnerable adults</em> refers to acts (eg, neglect) by persons in a caregiving role for persons 18 years or older who rely on a caregiver due to physical or mental disability, or both, and are unable to protect themselves.<sup>1</sup> The legal definition of vulnerable adults varies by state. Abuse of older adults or vulnerable adults includes physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional or psychological abuse, neglect, abandonment, and financial or material exploitation.<sup>1</sup> The populations addressed in this recommendation are not mutually exclusive. For example, older adults may have disabilities that could categorize them as &ldquo;vulnerable,&rdquo; and older or vulnerable adults may experience IPV.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<h3>Assessment of Risk of IPV</h3>\r\n<p>IPV affects persons of all ages, racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic backgrounds.<sup>1</sup> In a recent systematic review, individual factors that consistently increased the risk of IPV included experiencing other forms of violence within the relationship, alcohol misuse, and mental health factors (posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, threats of self-harm, borderline personality disorder).<sup>1,11</sup> Another systematic review reported unplanned pregnancy, having parents with a low level of education (eg, less than a high school diploma), and being young and unmarried are specific risk factors for IPV perpetrated against women.<sup>1,12</sup> Evidence suggests that pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of initiation of physical violence among women whose partners did not want the pregnancy and is also associated with an increased risk of continued physical violence during pregnancy in women with an unintended pregnancy who experienced physical violence prior to conception.<sup>1,13</sup></p>\r\n<p>Based on recent survey data, women identifying as Asian or Pacific Islander (27%), Black (54%), Hispanic (42%), Native American or Alaska Native (58%), multiracial (64%), or White (48%) report experiencing IPV in their lifetime.<sup>3</sup> IPV exposure can begin at an early age, with 27% of women reporting first contact of sexual violence, physical violence, or stalking at 17 years or younger.<sup>3</sup> In a 2019 Youth Risk Behavioral Surveillance System survey, adolescent girls and boys reported experiencing physical dating violence (9% and 7%, respectively) and sexual dating violence (13% and 4%, respectively).<sup>1,14</sup></p>\r\n<p>Studies report that the prevalence of IPV varies by sexual orientation.<sup>1,15</sup> According to the 2016/2017 National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey, 79% of women identifying as bisexual, 60% of women who identify as lesbian, and 53% of women who identify as heterosexual reported experiencing contact sexual violence in their lifetime.<sup>1,15</sup> In a recent systematic review, people who reported a gender that differs from their sex experienced increased prevalence of IPV (74 studies; n = 1,273,989 participants; relative risk, 1.7 [95% CI, 1.4-2.0]).<sup>1,16</sup><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<h3>Screening Tests for IPV</h3>\r\n<p>Screening for IPV often involves use of a brief questionnaire to assess current or recent abuse.<sup>1</sup> Several screening instruments can be used to detect IPV in the primary care setting, including but not limited to the Humiliation, Afraid, Rape, Kick (HARK);<sup>17</sup> Hurt, Insult, Threaten, Scream (HITS);<sup>18</sup> and Woman Abuse Screening Tool (WAST).<sup>19</sup></p>\r\n<p>Due to fear, intimidation, and lack of support, persons may not disclose abuse unless directly questioned and when questioned still may not disclose it.<sup>1</sup> Barriers to disclosure of IPV for persons experiencing abuse include concern about negative clinician attitudes, perception of safety, and concern about the consequences of disclosing abuse.<sup>1,20</sup> Facilitators to disclosure of IPV include a positive relationship with a clinician and clinicians directly asking persons experiencing abuse about IPV in private and safe settings.<sup>1,20</sup> According to a recent study, factors such as mistrust of police; fear of children being removed from the home; language barriers; and unfamiliarity with laws, rights, and services may contribute to barriers to seeking help for specific groups of women, including Asian, Black, immigrant, and &ldquo;minority ethnic&rdquo; women.<sup>1,21</sup> Further, mandatory reporting requirements of IPV can also elicit concerns in people experiencing abuse due to fear of negative consequences.<sup>1,22</sup> State and local reporting requirements vary from one jurisdiction to another, with differences in definitions, who and what should be reported, who should report, and to whom. Some states require clinicians (including primary care clinicians) to report abuse to legal authorities, and most require reporting of injuries resulting from guns, knives, or other weapons.<sup>23</sup><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<h3>Screening Intervals for IPV</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no evidence on appropriate intervals for screening.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<h3>Interventions for IPV</h3>\r\n<p>Based on the evidence, effective interventions generally address multiple factors related to IPV (such as depression rather than IPV alone), involve ongoing support services and multiple visits, and provide a range of emotional support and behavioral and social services.<sup>1</sup> In clinical trials, these interventions were conducted in pregnant or postpartum women. Effective multicomponent interventions were delivered over multiple sessions and combined components specific to IPV with components addressing health, family, or social needs that may be barriers or facilitators to ending abuse (eg, counseling for depression, postpartum and parenting support, training related to conflict resolution, and linkage to community services). Studies of interventions that provided brief counseling specific to IPV and the provision of information about referral options in the absence of multicomponent interventions generally did not demonstrate benefit.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<h3>Additional Tools and Resources</h3>\r\n<h4>Intimate Partner Violence</h4>\r\n<p>The CDC&rsquo;s report &ldquo;Intimate Partner Violence Prevention: Resource for Action&rdquo; highlights strategies based on the best available evidence to help states and communities prevent IPV, support survivors, and lessen the harms of IPV (<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/violence-prevention/media/pdf/resources-for-action/IPV-Prevention-Resource_508.pdf\">https://www.cdc.gov/violence-prevention/media/pdf/resources-for-action/IPV-Prevention-Resource_508.pdf</a>).</p>\r\n<p>The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine&rsquo;s report &ldquo;Essential Health Care Services Addressing Intimate Partner Violence&rdquo; presents findings from research and deliberations and recommendations for leaders of health care systems, federal agencies, clinicians, emergency planners, and those involved in IPV research (<a href=\"https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/27425/essential-health-care-services-addressing-intimate-partner-violence\">https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/27425/essential-health-care-services-addressing-intimate-partner-violence</a>).</p>\r\n<p>The US Department of Veterans Affairs&rsquo; Intimate Partner Violence Assistance Program is committed to helping veterans, their partners, and Veterans Affairs staff who are affected by IPV (<a href=\"https://www.socialwork.va.gov/IPV/Index.asp\">https://www.socialwork.va.gov/IPV/Index.asp</a>).<em>&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n<h4>Abuse of Older or Vulnerable Adults</h4>\r\n<p>The Administration for Community Living (ACL) features resources for older adults and adults with vulnerabilities. ACL is focused on developing systems and programs that prevent abuse from happening, protecting persons from abusive situations, and supporting persons who have experienced abuse to help them recover (<a href=\"https://acl.gov/programs/protecting-rights-and-preventing-abuse\">https://acl.gov/programs/protecting-rights-and-preventing-abuse</a>). ACL&rsquo;s National Family Caregiver Support Program highlights services to provide state and community-based coordinated support for caregivers (<a href=\"https://acl.gov/programs/support-caregivers/national-family-caregiver-support-program\">https://acl.gov/programs/support-caregivers/national-family-caregiver-support-program</a>).</p>\r\n<p>The CDC highlights information on abuse in older persons, including resources on strengthening prevention strategies (<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/elder-abuse/about/index.html\">https://www.cdc.gov/elder-abuse/about/index.html</a>).</p>\r\n<p>The National Institutes of Health&rsquo;s National Institute on Aging features several resources that could assist primary care clinicians who care for older adults, including information on healthy aging (<a href=\"https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/caregiving/healthy-aging-tips-older-adults-your-life\">https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/caregiving/healthy-aging-tips-older-adults-your-life</a>) and spotting signs of abuse in older adults (<a href=\"https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/elder-abuse/spotting-signs-elder-abuse\">https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/elder-abuse/spotting-signs-elder-abuse</a>).<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement and Other Populations</h3>\r\n<p>When deciding whether to screen for caregiver abuse in older or vulnerable adults or intimate partner violence in other populations, clinicians should consider the following factors.<em>&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n<h4>Potential Preventable Burden<strong>&nbsp;</strong></h4>\r\n<p><strong>Caregiver Abuse of Older Adults. </strong>Prevalence estimates of abuse in older adults vary, but abuse is common.<sup>1</sup> Risk factors for experiencing abuse include isolation, lack of social support, functional impairment, poor physical health, cognitive impairment, low socioeconomic status, and history of being in an abusive relationship.<sup>1,24-26</sup> Based on nationwide data from a recent study in older adults, more than 1 in 10 older adults (12%) experienced a single form of abuse and 2% experienced multiple forms of abuse over their lifetimes.<sup>1,27</sup> Financial exploitation (35%) and neglect (34%) were the most commonly reported types of abuse.<sup>1,27</sup> Older adults are more likely to experience abuse by nonintimate partners (56%) but also experience IPV (23%) and abuse by nonintimate and intimate partners (21%).<sup>28</sup> Older adults experiencing abuse experience serious negative physical health effects and adverse psychological consequences, including distress, anxiety, and depression.<sup>1,6,29</sup></p>\r\n<p><strong>Abuse of Vulnerable Adults. </strong>Based on estimates from a recent survey in noninstitutional settings, persons with disabilities were more likely to experience violence (violent crime, rape or sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault, and simple assault) compared with persons without disabilities (approximately 46 per 1000 persons with a disability vs 12 per 1000 persons without a disability). In this survey, adults with cognitive disabilities were most likely to experience violence (83 per 1000 persons).<sup>1,7</sup> Women with disabilities are more likely to experience lifetime IPV<sup>1,30</sup> compared with men with disabilities, men without disabilities, and women without disabilities.<sup>1,30</sup> More than one-half (59%) of all violent acts experienced by vulnerable adults were committed by intimate partners, other relatives, or well-known acquaintances.<sup>1,7</sup><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>IPV in Other Populations. </strong>Evidence suggests that IPV may be most common during adolescence and young adulthood;<sup>2</sup> however, women of all ages report IPV. Approximately 2% of women 45 years or older experienced first contact of sexual violence, physical violence, or stalking by an intimate partner in the past 12 months.<sup>3</sup><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>IPV in Men. </strong>More than 44% of men report sexual violence, physical violence, or stalking by an intimate partner in their lifetime.<sup>3</sup> Among men who experience sexual violence, physical violence, or stalking, the most common IPV-related adverse effects include posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms, feeling fearful, feeling concerned for safety, injury, missing days of work or school, and needing legal services.<sup>3</sup><em>&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n<h4>Potential Harms</h4>\r\n<p>Potential harms of screening for abuse in older or vulnerable adults and for IPV in men and other populations include shame, guilt, self-blame, retaliation or abandonment by perpetrators, and the repercussions of false-positive results (eg, labeling and stigma).<sup>1</sup> Studies of harms were primarily conducted in person. Virtual visits may expand access to screening but may increase potential for harm due to a partner or caregiver overhearing responses to screening questions.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Current Practice&nbsp;</h4>\r\n<p><strong>Caregiver Abuse of Older or Vulnerable Adults. </strong>For abuse of older adults, mandatory reporting laws and regulations vary by state; however, most states require reporting.<sup>1</sup> The review found limited evidence on screening instruments to accurately detect caregiver abuse or neglect. The review did not find recent estimates of screening in clinical practice for abuse in older and vulnerable adults in the US.<sup>1</sup><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<h3>Other Related USPSTF Recommendations</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of primary care interventions to prevent child maltreatment in children and adolescents younger than 18 years without signs and symptoms of or known exposure to maltreatment.<sup>31</sup> The USPSTF recommends screening for depression in adolescents and adults.<sup>32,33</sup></p><h2>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h2><p>This recommendation updates the 2018 USPSTF recommendation statement on screening for IPV and screening for abuse in older or vulnerable adults. In 2018, the USPSTF recommended that clinicians screen for IPV in women of reproductive age and provide or refer women who screen positive to ongoing support services.<sup>34</sup> The USPSTF also concluded that the evidence was insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for abuse and neglect in all older or vulnerable adults.<sup>34</sup> The current recommendation statement is consistent with the 2018 recommendation. To highlight that the evidence base is strongest in those who are pregnant and postpartum, the USPSTF specified these populations in this recommendation statement. For abuse of older or vulnerable adults, the term &ldquo;caregiver&rdquo; was added before abuse or neglect when appropriate to clarify when the focus was on screening for abuse or neglect perpetrated by a caregiver or someone they trust.</p>","other":"<h2>Supporting Evidence</h2><h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF commissioned a systematic review<sup>1</sup> to evaluate the benefits and harms of screening for IPV, abuse of older adults, and abuse of vulnerable adults. The review also evaluated the evidence on the accuracy of screening tests for IPV and abuse of older or vulnerable adults and the benefits and harms of interventions for IPV and abuse of older or vulnerable adults. The scope of this review is similar to that of the prior systematic review.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening Tests<em>&nbsp;</em></h3>\r\n<h4>IPV</h4>\r\n<p>Accuracy varied across 17 studies evaluating screening tools to identify IPV.<sup>1,35</sup> The assessment tools were administered in emergency departments, primary care practices, urgent care, and antenatal clinics and by telephone or mail.<sup>1,35</sup> Most screening tools were designed to identify exposure to IPV within the past year. The remaining tools assessed current or ongoing IPV, lifetime abuse, or the ability to predict future IPV.<sup>1,35</sup> The majority of studies recruited adult women 18 years or older. One study included women as young as 16 years, and 1 study recruited men.<sup>1,35</sup> Studies assessed 14 different screening tools; most screening tools were assessed by a single study and used the longer structured 39-item Conflict Tactics Scale 2 (CTS2) as the reference standard.<sup>1,35</sup></p>\r\n<p>The 9 studies to detect exposure to IPV within the past year used 9 different screening tools: Abuse Assessment Screen; Afraid, Controlled, Threatened, Slapped or physically hurt screen; HARK; HITS; Electronic HITS (E-HITS); Partner Violence Screen; Parent Screening Questionnaire; and WAST and WAST-Short. Sensitivity ranged from 26% to 87% and specificity ranged from 80% to 97%.<sup>1,35</sup> Generally available screening tools may reasonably identify women experiencing IPV in the past year.<sup>1,35</sup> The review estimated that use of the HARK screening tool (80% sensitivity and 95% specificity) would result in 81,000 true-positive test results and 5000 false-positive test results (positive predictive value, 83%) in a population of 100 000 women with a 15% prevalence of IPV (similar to the prevalence rate of IPV reported in studies in US primary care settings).<sup>1,35</sup></p>\r\n<p>In a single study in men (n = 53) on the accuracy of the PVS screening tool in the emergency department to detect past-year IPV, sensitivity was low on both the Partner Violence Screen and HITS tools compared with CTS2 scores for psychological abuse (35% and 30%, respectively) and for detecting physical abuse (46% for both tools).<sup>1,35,36</sup> In 6 studies of tools to detect current or ongoing IPV, sensitivity ranged from 12% to 94% and specificity ranged from 38% to 100%.<sup>1,35,37-42</sup> In a single study focused on the accuracy of the Slapped, Things, Threaten tool in detecting lifetime IPV, sensitivity was 96% and specificity was 75%, compared with the reference tool (Index of Spouse Abuse).<sup>1,35,43</sup> In a single study (n = 409) of a 3-item tool to predict future abuse, sensitivity was 20% (95% CI, 13%-30%) and specificity was 96% (95% CI, 93%-98%).<sup>1,35,44</sup><em>&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n<h4>Abuse of Older Adults</h4>\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed 2 cross-sectional studies (n = 1055) on the accuracy of tools to detect abuse and neglect among adults 65 years or older.<sup>1,35</sup> In a study assessing the Hwalek-Sengstock Elder Abuse Screening Test (n = 139), accuracy was low (sensitivity, 46% [95% CI, 32%-59%] and specificity, 73% [95% CI, 62%-82%]) for detecting physical or verbal abuse in generally healthy older adults presenting for routine dental care.<sup>1,35,45</sup> In the other study using the Emergency Department Senior Abuse Identification screening tool to detect abuse, sensitivity was 94% (95% CI, 71%-100%) and specificity was 84% (95% CI, 76%-91%).<sup>1,35,46</sup> Both studies assessed 2 different tools in 2 different settings. Whether these results are applicable to routine primary care settings is uncertain.<sup>1,35</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Abuse of Vulnerable Adults</h4>\r\n<p>The review identified no studies on screening tools to detect abuse and neglect of vulnerable adults.<sup>1,35</sup><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Interventions<em>&nbsp;</em></h3>\r\n<h4>IPV</h4>\r\n<p>Generally, intervention benefit varied by intervention characteristics and recruited population.<sup>1,35</sup> Effective interventions involved ongoing support services, which included multiple visits with patients, addressed multiple risk factors (not just IPV), and provided a range of emotional support and behavioral and social services.<sup>1,35</sup> Studies delivering these multicomponent, multiple-visit interventions were conducted in pregnant and postpartum women and did not focus on nonpregnant women or on men.<sup>1,35</sup> Brief interventions generally did not demonstrate effectiveness, regardless of population (including pregnant or postpartum women or women who were not pregnant or recently delivered).<sup>1,35</sup><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Pregnant and Postpartum Populations. </strong>Thirteen studies (n = 7425) assessed the effectiveness of interventions in persons with screen-detected IPV (or at risk for IPV). Of these, 7 studies (n = 2644) assessed effectiveness of interventions during pregnancy and the postpartum period.<sup>1,35</sup> In the 3 studies that assessed intensive services, interventions were delivered in home visits or outpatient settings to pregnant and postpartum women.<sup>1,35</sup> Two home-visit intervention studies<sup>47,48</sup> (n = 882) that included multiple visits over 1 to 2 years found lower rates of IPV in women assigned to the intervention group compared with the control group.<sup>1,35</sup> In 1 study, IPV events were lower in the intervention group (7.50 events per person-year) compared with the control group (9.55 events per person-year) at 3 years, but the difference was not statistically significant (incident rate ratio of average IPV events per person-year, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.73-1.01]).<sup>47</sup> The other home-visit study found statistically significant lower mean CTS2 scores from baseline in the intervention group compared with the control group at 2 years (&minus;40.82 vs &minus;35.87; mean difference in change from baseline scores, &minus;4.95; <em>P</em> &lt; .001).<sup>48</sup> The third trial (n = 913) enrolled women who screened positive for one of several risk factors for adverse perinatal outcomes (cigarette smoking, environmental tobacco smoke exposure, depression, and IPV); those randomized to the intervention received counseling specific to each identified risk factor.<sup>1,35</sup> In the subgroup of women who screened positive for IPV at baseline (n = 306), those receiving the intervention had significantly fewer recurrent episodes of IPV during pregnancy and postpartum (odds ratio, 0.48 [95% CI, 0.29-0.80]) and fewer very preterm neonates (&le;33 weeks&rsquo; gestation) (2 vs 9 women; <em>P</em> = .03).<sup>1,35,49</sup> Interventions were delivered over a mean of 4.7 sessions (range, 4-10 sessions) over 5 months.<sup>1,35,49</sup></p>\r\n<p>In 4 studies assessing brief clinic-based interventions in pregnant and postpartum women, 3 focused on counseling specific to IPV.<sup>1,35</sup> Of those 3 studies, 2 found no group differences in rates of IPV,<sup>50,51</sup> and 1 found mixed results for subtypes of IPV<sup>52</sup> (the benefit was significant for psychological and minor physical abuse and not for severe physical and sexual abuse).<sup>1,35</sup></p>\r\n<p><strong>Nonpregnant Women. </strong>Three studies (n = 3759) compared screening with no screening for IPV and found no benefit when screening was followed by brief interventions.<sup>1,35,53-55</sup> In these trials of adult women (mean age, 34 to 40 years), 1 study reported including 5% pregnant women, the other 2 studies did not report including any pregnant or postpartum women, and none included adolescents or men.<sup>1,35</sup> Studies assessed screening followed by brief education and referral options for women who screened positive.<sup>1,35</sup> Trials did not provide ongoing support services and did not report the proportion of women receiving intensive services after referral.<sup>1,35</sup> None of the 3 studies reported improvements in screened groups compared with groups that were not screened on health outcomes, including IPV, quality of life, or mental health outcomes.<sup>1,35</sup></p>\r\n<p>Six trials enrolling nonpregnant women measured changes in overall IPV incidence. Five trials reported on specific categories of IPV.<sup>1,35</sup> Generally, compared with studies enrolling pregnant and postpartum populations, studies in nonpregnant women provided fewer visits with less contact time and did not provide education or support specific to child development, parenting, or risk factors related to adverse perinatal outcomes (other than IPV, such as depression and smoking).<sup>1,35</sup> Four studies reported no group differences in rates of overall IPV or combined physical and sexual violence.<sup>1,35,56-59</sup> One study reported mixed results on IPV subtypes.<sup>1,35,60</sup> Interventions in nonpregnant women primarily included brief counseling, provision of information, and referrals.<sup>1,35</sup></p>\r\n<p><strong>Other Populations. </strong>A study assessing interventions for new parent couples (n = 368 couples, described as male and female partners) found no significant group differences in IPV rates at 15 or 24 months.<sup>1,35,61</sup> The review identified no eligible screening or intervention studies for IPV in men.<em>&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n<h4>Abuse of Older Adults</h4>\r\n<p>There were no identified studies on benefits of screening or early interventions in older adults.<sup>1,35</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Abuse of Vulnerable Adults</h4>\r\n<p>There were no identified studies on benefits of screening or early interventions in vulnerable adults.<sup>1,35</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Screening or Treatment</h3>\r\n<h4><em>&nbsp;</em>IPV</h4>\r\n<p>Two trials in adult women reported on harms of screening for IPV and identified no adverse effects of screening.<sup>1,35</sup> One randomized clinical trial (n = 591) developed a specific tool, the Consequences of Screening Tool, to measure the consequences of IPV screening, such as &ldquo;Because the questions on partner violence were asked, I feel my home life has become (less difficult&hellip; more difficult).&rdquo;<sup>1,35,55</sup> Results indicated that being asked IPV screening questions was not harmful to women immediately after screening.<sup>1,35</sup> Another trial (n = 399) reported no adverse events; however, it was unclear whether events were prespecified or how they were monitored.<sup>1,35,54</sup></p>\r\n<p>Five trials reported on harms of interventions and identified no significant harms associated with the interventions.<sup>1,35</sup> One trial assessing a brief counseling intervention surveyed women at 6, 12, and 24 months about survey participation (including potential harms) and found no group differences in the percentage of women who reported harms. The authors concluded no harms were associated with the intervention.<sup>1,35,58,62</sup> Among women who reported that their abusive partner was aware of their participation in the trial, the number of negative partner behaviors (eg, got angry, made her more afraid for herself or her children, or restricted her freedom) was not significantly different between groups.<sup>1,35</sup> In another trial that asked by telephone whether violence frequency increased after taking part in an antenatal clinic study, the authors reported no adverse events related to study participation by women.<sup>1,35,52</sup> Other trials also reported no harms associated with interventions; however, it was unclear how harms were measured or assessed.<sup>1,35,48,59,60</sup></p>\r\n<p>There were no identified studies that reported on harms of screening or interventions in men.<sup>1,35</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Abuse of Older Adults</h4>\r\n<p>There were no identified studies on harms of screening or interventions in older adults.<sup>1,35</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Abuse of Vulnerable Adults</h4>\r\n<p>There were no identified studies on harms of screening or interventions in vulnerable adults.<sup>1,35</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comments</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from October 29 to November 25, 2024. In general, most comments agreed with the recommendation statement. Some comments requested the USPSTF highlight the potential harms that could be associated with screening. The USPSTF is deeply concerned about the risk of harm associated with IPV screening. While the USPSTF found limited evidence of harms in its review of the evidence, the recommendation statement specifies that optimal delivery of screening occurs in safe and private settings. The USPSTF also included materials that clinicians can use to support survivors of abuse in the Additional Tools and Resources section. Several comments expressed concern that the I statement for caregiver abuse might be interpreted as a recommendation against screening. The USPSTF wants to clarify that its I statement is not a recommendation for or against screening for caregiver abuse in older or vulnerable adults. The I statement indicates that the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms and is a call for more research.

Interventions for children younger than 5 years are addressed in a separate recommendation.</p>\r\n<h3>Condition Definitions</h3>\r\n<p>Dental caries refers to a multifactorial disease process resulting in demineralization of the teeth.<sup>10</sup> Bacteria in the mouth metabolize sugars from food and drink to produce acids that erode tooth enamel.<sup>1,2,10</sup> When left untreated, demineralization can weaken and destroy the enamel, forming cavities and causing pain, infection, and tooth loss.<sup>2</sup> Oral health conditions for this recommendation statement refer to clinical health outcomes focused on the presence and severity of dental caries, or caries burden (based on the number of affected teeth or surfaces), morbidity, quality of life, functional status, and harms of screening or treatment related to these conditions.<sup>1</sup> The USPSTF focused on dental caries as the most common oral health condition and the most potentially amenable to primary care interventions.</p>\r\n<h3>Screening Tests and Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>For the purposes of this review, screening included clinical assessments (eg, physical examination) and standardized risk prediction tools or a combination of approaches by primary care clinicians to identify children who have existing oral health conditions or children who might most benefit from interventions to prevent future negative oral health outcomes due to increased risk.<sup>1</sup> The USPSTF focused on dental caries as the most common oral health condition and the most potentially amenable to primary care interventions. Reviewed interventions focused on preventing future dental caries, including counseling and health education toward reducing the burden of bacteria in the mouth, decreasing the frequency of refined sugar intake, and promoting resistance to caries in the teeth through use of fluoride, dental sealants, silver diamine fluoride (SDF), and xylitol.<sup>1,2,12,13</sup> The USPSTF found insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening or preventive interventions for oral health conditions in the primary care setting for children and adolescents, and suggests primary care clinicians use their clinical expertise to decide whether to perform these services.</p>\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>\r\n<p>In deciding whether to routinely screen or deliver interventions to prevent oral health conditions, primary care clinicians should consider the following.</p>\r\n<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>\r\n<p>Dental caries is a common chronic condition of childhood; in 2011 in the US, more than 50% of children aged 6 to 11 years had dental caries in primary teeth and 17% had caries in permanent teeth.<sup>1,2</sup> In the US, an estimated 5.2% of children aged 6 to 11 years and 17% of adolescents aged 12 to 19 years had untreated dental caries in permanent teeth, based on 2011 to 2016 data.<sup>1,14</sup> Developmental defects in teeth, inadequate salivary composition or flow, frequent intake of dietary sugars (in foods and beverages), suboptimal fluoride exposure, and oral hygiene practices (eg, lack of tooth brushing and flossing) can increase susceptibility to dental caries.<sup>1,2</sup> Social determinants of health (nonbiological factors) associated with increased risk of oral health conditions include low socioeconomic status, lack of dental insurance, and living in communities with dental professional shortages, limiting access to dental care.<sup>1,2</sup></p>\r\n<p>These inequities associated with social determinants of health can exacerbate and perpetuate oral health disparities.<sup>2</sup> For example, children experiencing poverty are more likely to experience food insecurity;<sup>2</sup> food insecurity is associated with increased intake of dietary refined sugars that elevates risk for dental caries.<sup>2,15</sup> Such disparities related to race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status also exist in receipt of preventive interventions.<sup>1,4</sup> For example, youth experiencing the highest levels of poverty are more likely to have dental caries (65%) compared with all youth (57%) but are less likely to have dental sealants on their permanent teeth (43%) than all youth (48%).<sup>1</sup> The USPSTF focused on dental caries as the most common oral health condition and the most potentially amenable to primary care interventions.</p>\r\n<p>While evidence is limited on the prevalence of periodontal disease in children and adolescents,<sup>1</sup> risk in pregnant youth may be elevated.<sup>4</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Potential Harms</h4>\r\n<p>Primary care screening approaches (eg, oral clinical assessments or standardized risk assessment instruments) to identify children with early untreated dental caries or children at increased risk for developing future dental caries are noninvasive and would seem unlikely to cause serious harms, but evidence is lacking. Health education and counseling to improve oral hygiene and reduce modifiable risk factors (eg, frequent intake of refined sugars) are also noninvasive.</p>\r\n<h4>Current Practice</h4>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found little evidence on current practices in primary care for screening or performing interventions to prevent dental caries in children aged 5 to 17 years. In its review of the evidence, the USPSTF found that preventive interventions are generally performed in dental settings by dental professionals. There are well-known significant barriers to providing oral health services in the primary care setting; oral health care and general health care operate as almost entirely separate systems, from training to financing and service settings.<sup>2,4</sup> Primary care clinicians have variable access and familiarity with oral health interventions.<sup>1,4</sup> As a result, oral health care delivery by primary care clinicians may require additional training and specific equipment to deliver screening and interventions.<sup>1,2</sup> Primary care clinicians may also have reimbursement challenges and face administrative obstacles to making dental referrals and linking patients to dental care.<sup>1</sup> The USPSTF recommends oral fluoride supplements starting at age 6 months for children younger than 5 years with water sources deficient in fluoride and administration of varnish to the primary teeth of all children younger than 5 years after tooth eruption.<sup>16</sup> It is unknown how frequently fluoride is administered in older children, adolescents, and adults.</p>\r\n<h3>Additional Tools and Resources</h3>\r\n<p>The Health Resources &amp; Services Administration&rsquo;s oral health fact sheet (<a href=\"https://www.hrsa.gov/sites/default/files/hrsa/oral-health/oral-health-2016-factsheet.pdf\">https://www.hrsa.gov/sites/default/files/hrsa/oral-health/oral-health-2016-factsheet.pdf</a>) and report <em>Integration of Oral Health and Primary Care Practice</em> (<a href=\"https://www.hrsa.gov/sites/default/files/hrsa/oral-health/integration-oral-health.pdf\">https://www.hrsa.gov/sites/default/files/hrsa/oral-health/integration-oral-health.pdf</a>) emphasize optimal collaborations between primary care clinicians and oral health professionals.</p>\r\n<p>The US Department of Health and Human Services&rsquo; <em>Oral Health in America: A</em> <em>Report of the Surgeon General</em> (<a href=\"https://www.nidcr.nih.gov/sites/default/files/2017-10/hck1ocv.%40www.surgeon.fullrpt.pdf\">https://www.nidcr.nih.gov/sites/default/files/2017-10/hck1ocv.%40www.surgeon.fullrpt.pdf</a>) and the National Institutes of Health&rsquo;s report <em>Oral Health in America: Advances and Challenges</em> (<a href=\"https://www.nidcr.nih.gov/sites/default/files/2021-12/Oral-Health-in-America-Advances-and-Challenges.pdf\">https://www.nidcr.nih.gov/sites/default/files/2021-12/Oral-Health-in-America-Advances-and-Challenges.pdf</a>) comprehensively describe the importance of oral health to overall health and highlight advances and challenges toward improving oral health in the US.</p>\r\n<p>The Community Preventive Services Task Force recommends fluoridation of community water sources to reduce dental caries (<a href=\"https://www.thecommunityguide.org/findings/dental-caries-cavities-community-water-fluoridation.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.thecommunityguide.org/findings/dental-caries-cavities-community-water-fluoridation.html</a>) and school-based dental sealant delivery programs to prevent dental caries (<a href=\"https://www.thecommunityguide.org/findings/dental-caries-cavities-school-based-dental-sealant-delivery-programs.html\">https://www.thecommunityguide.org/findings/dental-caries-cavities-school-based-dental-sealant-delivery-programs.html</a>).</p>\r\n<h3>Other Related USPSTF Recommendations</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF recommends interventions to prevent dental caries in children younger than 5 years<sup>16</sup> and has issued recommendations for screening and preventive interventions for oral health in adults.<sup>17</sup></p>","other":"<h2>Supporting Evidence</h2><h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF commissioned a systematic evidence review<sup>1,31</sup> to evaluate the benefits and harms of screening and preventive interventions for oral health conditions in children and adolescents aged 5 to 17 years. The USPSTF previously addressed counseling to prevent dental and periodontal disease (1996) and, most recently, screening and interventions to prevent dental caries in children younger than 5 years (2021). Concurrently, the USPSTF commissioned a systematic evidence review to evaluate the benefits and harms of oral health screening and preventive interventions in adults;<sup>18</sup> this recommendation is addressed in a separate statement.<sup>17</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF review identified limited evidence on available clinical screening instruments or clinical assessments and their clinical accuracy to identify children and adolescents with oral health conditions in the primary care setting. The review identified a single observational study (n = 632)<sup>1,31</sup> assessing diagnostic accuracy using visual screening by a registered nurse (n = 219) or a 17-item questionnaire (n = 305) completed by parents or guardians to identify untreated dental caries in children aged 5 to 12 years.<sup>1,31</sup> The nurses received 5 hours of training along with written materials on screening and diagnoses.<sup>1,31</sup> The visual screening approach was associated with a sensitivity of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.84-0.97) and a specificity of 0.993 (95% CI, 0.96-0.9998).<sup>1,31</sup> The questionnaire, which included items on the condition of the child&rsquo;s mouth and socioeconomic and sociodemographic factors, was associated with a sensitivity of 0.69 (95% CI, 0.60-0.77) and a specificity of 0.88 (95% CI, 0.83-0.93).<sup>1,31</sup></p>\r\n<p>The review found no evidence on screening to identify children or adolescents aged 5 to 17 years at increased risk for future adverse oral health outcomes.<sup>1,31</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Screening</h3>\r\n<p>The review identified no evidence on the effectiveness of screening on future oral health outcomes.<sup>1,31</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Screening</h3>\r\n<p>The review identified no evidence on the harms of screening.<sup>1,31</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Preventive Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>While the USPSTF sought evidence on interventions to prevent a broad collection of oral health conditions that could be addressed in the primary care setting, identified studies focused on dental caries interventions performed by dental health professionals in a dental or school setting or administered in supervised school settings.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF also sought evidence on the effectiveness of oral health behavioral counseling by the primary care clinician on oral health outcomes but found no eligible studies for review in school-age children and adolescents. Current evidence is limited to dental professional&ndash;led or school-based education or counseling, often combined with other interventions; the counseling interventions were of uncertain feasibility to the primary care setting or reported intermediate outcomes (eg, effects of interventions on beliefs about oral health) rather than direct dental health outcomes.<sup>1,31</sup> The following discussion focuses on preventive medications.<strong> </strong>Studies often had significant methodological limitations (eg, high attrition, unclear randomization, or uncertain applicability to the US) and did not report analysis by race and ethnicity, socioeconomic status, or other important social determinants of health. Studies inconsistently reported community water fluoridation levels or whether participants received oral health education, precluding evaluation of the effectiveness of these factors on oral health outcomes. Studies focused on dental caries outcomes measured as decayed, missing, or filled teeth/decayed or filled teeth (DMFT/DFT) or decayed, missing, or filled surfaces/decayed or filled surfaces (DMFS/DFS) increment (change from baseline to follow-up in the DMFT/DFT or DMFS/DFS index [number of affected teeth or surfaces]), with limited evidence on nonoral health outcomes such as quality of life or functional status, including school-related outcomes.</p>\r\n<h4>Fluoride</h4>\r\n<p>Among 7 trials that evaluated fluoride supplements vs placebo or no fluoride in children 5 years or older (n = 3382),<sup>1,31</sup> 1 trial of self-administered fluoride supplements at home with low adherence found no benefit on stratified analysis (n = 438; mean difference, 0.13 [95% CI, &minus;0.38 to 0.64]).<sup>1,31</sup> In 6 other trials of supplements supervised at school, intake of fluoride supplements was associated with decreased dental caries increment in permanent teeth (6 trials; effective n = 1395; mean difference, &minus;0.73 [95% CI, &minus;1.30 to &minus;0.19]).<sup>1,31</sup></p>\r\n<p>Similarly, in a systematic review (26 trials)<sup>19</sup> evaluating application of topical fluoride gel vs placebo or no gel in children aged 5 to 15 years, gel was applied at school in 19 trials or in a dental clinic in 7 trials.<sup>1,31</sup> Dental professionals applied gel in 15 trials, while gels were self-applied and supervised by a dental hygienist or other nondental professional adult in 11 trials.<sup>1,31</sup> Topical gels were associated with decreased dental caries burden in permanent teeth at about 3 years (based on the DFT or DMFT score) (10 trials; n = 3198; prevented fraction, 0.32 [95% CI, 0.19-0.46]; prevented fraction is the difference in increment between the control and intervention groups, divided by the control group increment).<sup>1,31</sup></p>\r\n<p>In a systematic review (14 trials)<sup>20</sup> of fluoride varnish administered exclusively by dental professionals in school settings to children 5 years or older, varnish was associated with decreased dental caries burden at 1 to 4.5 years based on the DMFS or DFS score (14 trials; n = 3419; prevented fraction, 0.43 [95% CI, 0.30-0.57]; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 75%) or DMFT or DFT score (5 trials; n = 3902; prevented fraction, 0.44 [95% CI, 0.11-0.76]; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 86%).<sup>1,31</sup> A subsequent trial (n = 5397)21 reported findings consistent with the systematic review.<sup>1,31</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Sealants, Silver Diamine Fluoride, and Xylitol</h4>\r\n<p>In a systematic review (7 trials) of resin-based sealants administered by dental health professionals in dental settings to children aged 5 to 10 years, sealants were associated with decreased risk of dental caries in the first molars at 2 years (7 trials; n = 1322; odds ratio, 0.12 [95% CI, 0.08-0.19]; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 72%).<sup>1,31</sup> Another systematic review (2 trials) and 1 additional trial found inconsistent effects associated with glass ionomer sealants vs no sealants on dental caries.<sup>1,31</sup></p>\r\n<p>In a single trial (n = 452)<sup>22</sup> of children with high baseline dental caries burden and suboptimal fluoridation, SDF solution administered by dental professionals was associated with fewer new surfaces with active caries in primary teeth (mean, 0.3 vs 1.4; <em>P</em> &lt; .001) and first permanent molars (mean, 0.4 vs 1.1; <em>P</em> &lt; .001) and decreased likelihood of new decayed or filled teeth (26.1% vs 49.7%; relative risk, 0.52 [95% CI, 0.40-0.70]).<sup>1,22,31</sup> Training approaches for dental professionals were not reported.<sup>1,31</sup></p>\r\n<p>The review identified 10 trials (n = 4267) evaluating xylitol in children 5 years or older.<sup>1,31</sup> In 2 fair-quality trials, xylitol was administered under supervision at school with no benefit, or the results varied by control.<sup>1,31</sup> In 1 trial (n = 496)<sup>23</sup> of children with low baseline dental caries burden, xylitol (vs no xylitol) was associated with no group differences in DMFS increment at 4 years (mean, 2.75 for xylitol for 1 year vs 3.02 for 2 years vs 2.74 for no xylitol; <em>P</em> &gt; .05).<sup>1,31</sup> A second fair-quality trial (n = 432)<sup>24</sup> of children with high baseline dental caries burden also found no difference between xylitol vs placebo in DMFS increment at 3 years (mean, 8.1 vs 8.3; <em>P</em> &gt; .05) and decreased DMFS increment in the xylitol group vs the no xylitol group (mean increment, 8.1 vs 12.4; <em>P</em> &lt; .05).<sup>1,31</sup> In 8 other trials (effective n = 1646), xylitol was associated with some benefit, but studies had significant methodological limitations (eg, unclear randomization, allocation, or concealment).<sup>1,31</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Preventive Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>The review found very limited evidence on the harms of interventions, including a lack of evidence on exposure to oral fluoride supplements in children and adolescents aged 5 to 17 years. Often, identified studies did not capture or report any harms.</p>\r\n<p>A single trial (n = 349)<sup>25</sup> reported no adverse events of fluoride supplements; other trials did not report harms.<sup>1,31</sup> Two trials (n = 490) found no association between use of fluoride gels and nausea, gagging, and vomiting (absolute risk difference, 0.01 [95% CI, &minus;0.01 to 0.02]; <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 0%).<sup>1,31</sup> A single trial reported self-limited adverse events (nausea) in 12 of 1473 children using fluoride varnish; 4 trials did not report harms.<sup>1,31</sup> In a systematic review of resin-based sealants, 3 trials (n = 775) reported no harms and 13 trials did not report harms.<sup>1,31</sup> A trial on glass ionomer sealants did not report harms.<sup>1,31</sup> A single trial (n = 452)<sup>22</sup> reported that SDF was associated with black staining on inactive dental caries in primary teeth (97% vs 48%; <em>P</em> &lt; .001) and in first permanent molars (86% vs 67%; <em>P</em> &lt; .001).<sup>1,31</sup> Studies reported that SDF treatment commonly results in black staining of carious lesions.<sup>1,26,31</sup> A single trial of xylitol (n = 296) reported 1 participant withdrawal due to diarrhea; 9 trials did not report harms.<sup>1,31</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from May 23, 2023, to June 20, 2023. Some comments expressed support for a recommendation for primary care screening and preventive interventions to expand dental care access and positively impact oral health disparities. The USPSTF is committed to advancing health equity and to the provision of equitable clinical preventive services to improve health. The USPSTF carefully considers evidence of benefits and harms, makes recommendations when supported by sufficient evidence, and makes recommendations on primary care&ndash;relevant services. Based on the evidence, the USPSTF cannot recommend for or against oral health screening or preventive interventions in the primary care setting for children and adolescents aged 5 to 17 years. Primary care clinicians should use their clinical expertise to decide whether to perform these services. The USPSTF is calling for additional research to fill critical evidence gaps on this topic. Several comments agreed that the evidence is too limited to recommend for or against oral health screening or preventive interventions feasible in primary care settings in children and adolescents aged 5 to 17 years. Last, some comments expressed concern that the current I statements could be misinterpreted as recommendations against screening and preventive interventions, so clarifying language was added to emphasize that the I statements are neither a recommendation for or against screening or preventive interventions, and to highlight its recommendation for preventive interventions for children younger than 5 years in the Other Related USPSTF Recommendations section.</p><h2>Research Needs and Gaps</h2><p>See <a href=\"#tab2\">Table 2</a> for research needs and gaps related to screening and preventive interventions for oral health in children and adolescents aged 5 to 17 years.</p><h2>Recommendations of Others</h2><p>The US Department of Health and Human Services&rsquo; <em>Oral Health in America: A</em> <em>Report of the Surgeon General</em> (2000) and the National Institutes of Health&rsquo;s update (2020) emphasized the importance of integrating oral health into primary care medical settings, primarily focusing on counseling, coordination, and referral.<sup>2,3</sup></p>\r\n<p>The National Academy of Medicine&rsquo;s (formerly the Institute of Medicine) and the Health Resources &amp; Services Administration&rsquo;s report <em>Advancing Oral Health in America</em> (2011) recommends strategic action for prioritization of oral health within US Department of Health and Human Services agencies and in its partnerships with other stakeholders.<sup>4</sup></p>\r\n<p>The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends pediatricians perform oral health risk assessments on all children at every routine well-child visit beginning at age 6 months. The AAP also recommends fluoride varnish application according to the AAP/Bright Futures periodicity schedule (applied at least once every 6 months for all children and every 3 months for children at high risk for dental caries) and dietary fluoride supplements for all children who do not have an adequate supply of fluoride in their primary drinking water.<sup>27</sup></p>\r\n<p>The American Dental Association and American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry have issued guidelines on oral health (eg, oral health education, sealants, prevention of dental caries, fluoride supplementation, and prevention of periodontitis) aimed at dental professionals.<sup>28,29</sup> The American Academy of Family Physicians recommends that primary care clinicians educate patients about risks and benefits of fluoride; it recommends dietary fluoride supplements for children age 6 months through 16 years in areas where fluoride drinking water levels are suboptimal.<sup>30</sup></p><h2>Table 2.
